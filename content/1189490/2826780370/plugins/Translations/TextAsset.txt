近日偶得一古籍，其上记录的似是失传已久的古代丹方，可惜已经难以复原。听说{daoyou}于丹道一途颇有研究，若是得空不妨来白帝楼一观，或许能有所发现。¤Recently, I came across an ancient book, which seems to be a long-lost ancient formula, but unfortunately it is difficult to recover. I've heard that {daoyou} is quite knowledgeable in the art of Pill, so if you have time, why not come to the White Emperor Pavilion and take a look, perhaps a dicovery can be made.
我已解决问题，就不麻烦{daoyou}了。¤I have solved the problem, so I won't bother {daoyou}.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，拍卖会那日未等到你，我便先回武陵城了。日后若是有事可用传音符联系。今年恰逢武陵城举办英杰会大比，{xiongdi}你可千万不要错过了！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, I didn't wait for you on the day of the auction, so I went back to Wuling City first. If you have any problems in the future, you can contact me with a voice transmission talisman. This year, the Wuling City will be hosting the Young Hero's Tournament, so don't miss out on it!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我被父亲关了禁闭，没办法与你一起观看英杰会的比试了，日后若是有事可用传音符联系。¤I've been confined by my father, so I won't be able to watch the competition with you.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我突破到炼气后期了！明年的英杰会比试我也会参加，到时再见！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, I've broken through to the late stage of Qi refinement! I'll be at next year's competition, so I'll see you then!

{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我终于突破到金丹期了。原本想回府后帮着父亲处理家族事宜，却没想到连父亲的面都没见着，也不知家里出了什么事...{xiongdi}，你若是有空可否来倪府一聚？¤{FirstName} {xiongdi}, I have finally broken through to the Golden Core stage. I originally wanted to help my father with family matters when I returned to the house, but I didn't expect to even see my father's face, and I don't know what happened to my family... {xiongdi}, if you are free can you come to the Ni House for a get-together?

{FirstName}{xiongdi}！我突然想起来之前还漏了点消息没有告诉你！\n阴冥海的灵魂体在正常情况下，修士是无法看见或感知到的。所以{FirstName}{xiongdi}在去往阴冥海前必须以秘法修炼成阴阳瞳神通。\n这神通只需前往吞云海收集七彩月兰三株，腐骨灵花三株，而后前往阴冥泉将草药投入水中，以泉水擦拭双目即可。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}! It suddenly occurred to me that I missed some news before and didn't tell you! \nUnder normal circumstances, cultivators cannot see or perceive the soul body of the Deep Yin Sea. Therefore, {FirstName}{xiongdi} must use the secret method to cultivate the magical power of Yin and Yang pupils before going to the Deep Yin Sea. \nFor this magical power, you only need to go to the Sea of Swallowing Clouds to collect three Rainbow moon orchids and three rotten bones, and then go to Deep Yin Spring to put the herbs into the water and wipe your eyes with the spring water.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}！！！还有，一定要在800年前回来！！！不然师祖指不定何时就飞升了！！！¤{FirstName} {xiongdi}!!! And make sure you come back before 800 years!!! Or else Martial Ancestor may not know when he will ascend!!!

倪家剑法果然名不虚传，那倪家少爷头脑一般，毅力倒是可佳，靠着这几招剑法倒也能在我手上撑上几个回合。¤The Young Patriarch of the Ni family has an average mind, but his perseverance is good, so he was able to last a few rounds with these sword moves.
林家二小姐果真天赋异禀，只不过她擅长的多是神念一派的法门，又是女儿身，与她交手实在难以放开拳脚。¤The Lin family's second young lady is really gifted, but she specialises in the Divine Mind school of magic and is a daughter, so it was difficult to let go of her fists and feet.

听说了么？最近有修炼采补功法的魔修出现在宁州。听说此人是星宫的叛徒，一身魔功在采补之术的加持下很是强力，甚至能以金丹之力越阶挑战元婴修士，{FirstName}{xiongdi}在外游历时要多加小心啊。¤Have you heard? Recently, there is a Evil cultivator who practiced the tonic technique appeared in Ningzhou.

小心跟上¤Follow carefully
两派相争¤Two factions are fighting
前方传来打斗的声音，你小心隐蔽身形，从远处观望，只见一群沂山派的修士正与另一群禾山道的修士们打得不可开交。这沂山与禾山一向井水不犯河水，如此争斗必有蹊跷。你决定...¤The sound of fighting is heard from ahead. You carefully conceal yourself and watch from a distance, only to see a group of Cultivator from the Mt. Yi School fighting with another group of Cultivator from the Mt. Harvest Sect. You see a group of Mt. Yi cultivators fighting with another group of Harvest Mountain cultivators. You decide...
暗中观察¤Watching in the Dark
你刚走进洞窟，引力突然变大，还没等你反应过来，就把你拉扯到了洞窟深处。你被牢牢地吸在了一处山壁上，动弹不得...\n几天之后，这吸力才渐渐消失。放眼望去，只见洞窟之中，遍地都是禽类尸骨，其中不乏一些修为尚浅的妖兽。你不敢逗留，从几具妖兽的尸体中取出它们的妖丹，然后飞快的逃离了此地。¤You have just stepped into the cave when the gravitational force suddenly becomes stronger and before you can react, it pulls you deeper into the cave. You are sucked firmly against one of the mountain walls and cannot move... \n It takes a few days before this suction fades away. Looking around, you see that the cave is littered with the bones of avian species, including some Spirit Beasts of still shallow cultivation. You don't dare to stay and take out their demon pellets from the corpses of a few Spirit Beasts, then fly away from this place.
你隐隐感觉到一股危险的气息，决定还是不要冒险，于是转身离开了。¤You vaguely sense an Qi of danger and decide that it is better not to take any chances, so you turn around and leave.
山庄的主人也是一位散修，他盛情邀请你在庄园内留住。你们一同在这里交流修炼中的心得体会，收获颇丰，度过了愉快的一周。{huanhang}修为+200{huanhang}心境+1¤The owner of the estate is also an independent cultivator. He warmly invites you to stay within the estate. Together, you exchange experiences and insights on cultivation, gaining much from it and spending a pleasant week. {huanhang}Cultivation+200{huanhang}Mind+1
你想起自己还有别的要事在身，不便在此多做逗留，便转身离开了。¤You remember that you have other important matters to attend to and are not in a position to linger much longer, so you turn to leave.
你闭上眼睛，对着漫天的流星雨许了一个愿，但是什么也没有发生...¤You close your eyes and make a wish on the meteor shower that fills the sky, but nothing happens...
这陨铁对于修真者来说，也是一种不可多得的炼器材料，你朝着流星坠落的方向追去，果然捡到了几颗陨铁。¤This meteorite iron is also an incomparable material for Cultivator to refine weapons. You chased after the meteor in the direction of its fall and did pick up a few of them.
雷雨交加¤A thunderstorm
你刚走近洞窟，便感到不对劲，看来已经有什么东西先你一步占据了这里...¤You have just approached the cave when you feel that something is wrong. It seems that something has taken over the place before you...
你回到山脚下的村庄，热情的山民为你收拾出一间温暖干燥的房间。你休息了一夜，觉得神清气爽，旅途的疲惫一扫而空，作为感谢，你留下了一些灵石。¤You return to the village at the foot of the mountain, where a warm and dry room has been made up for you by the welcoming mountain people. You rest for the night, feeling refreshed and cleared of your travel fatigue, and as a thank you, you leave some spirit stones.
幽谷奇遇¤A strange encounter in the valley
你伸手去摘彩莲，但彩莲却纹丝不动，正当你觉得奇怪之时，一道黑影从水池中窜出，咬住了你的手臂...¤You reach out to pick the colourful lotus, but it does not budge. Just as you are wondering, a black Shadow emerges from the pool and bites your arm...
你谨慎地检查了这具尸体，发现他是身中剧毒而亡，看来这天地灵宝果然不是这么好采摘的，一定另有玄机。你将尸骨旁的储物袋收下，便小心翼翼的离开了。¤You examine the corpse cautiously and find that it has been poisoned to death, so it seems that this heavenly treasure is not so easy to pick. You take the storage bag next to the corpse and leave carefully.
村庄¤The Village
你停下脚步，就这么远远地看着他们...修真之路道阻且长，偶尔回头看看，也会有新的感悟。¤You stop and just watch them from afar... The path of cultivation is a long and difficult one, and occasionally you look back and gain new insights.
你明白，自己已经走上了一条和普通人截然不同的道路，再也无法回头...而凡世间的种种，也不该再有留念了。¤You understand that you have embarked on a path so different from that of ordinary people that there is no turning back... And there should be no more remembrance of the mortal world.
山村内部空无一人，但未熄灭的炊烟、整齐的院落，种种迹象显示此地不久前还在有村民存在，眼前一片死寂的景象却也让你心中甚是不安。¤The interior of the village is empty, but the unlit smoke, the neatly organized courtyard, all the signs that there were villagers here not so long ago, make you feel very uneasy.
事出反常必有妖，还是小心为上。¤There are always demons when things go wrong, so it's best to be careful.
那天狼帮主也不过一名先天武者，怎是你一合之敌？你三两招就重伤击退了他，巨鲸门上下感激涕零，其大师兄将镇门之宝赠与你。¤The Lord of the Heavenly Wolf Gang is only an innate martial artist, how can he be your opponent? You repelled him in three or two strokes, and the whole clan was so grateful that his eldest brother gave you the treasure of the clan.
你感叹慢慢仙途，逆天而行，不论是天灾还是人祸，人各有命，便离开了。¤You lamented that the journey to immortality is slowly going against the heavens, and whether it is a natural or man-made disaster, everyone has their own destiny, so you left.
你悄悄跟上，探听到：“护法传信，叛徒在九嶷山附近显现。”“那地方靠近竹山宗，大家小心行事。”“哈哈看来追回嗜血珠的功劳有你我一份了。”“白痴，有人跟上我们了，你先去解决了他，其他人分开走，然后我们九嶷山回合。”¤You follow quietly and spy, 'The Sect Guardian has sent a message that the traitor has manifested near Mt. Jiuyi.' 'That place is near the Bamboo Mountain Sect, so everyone be careful.' 'Haha looks like you and I get the credit for recovering the Bloodthirsty Pearl.' 'Idiot, someone is following us, you go and finish him off first, the others will split up and then we'll meet up at Mt. Jiuyi.'
多一事，不如少一事。你转身离开了。¤One more thing is better than less. You turn and leave.
你躲在远处暗中观察，隐约听到“青面鬼”，“宝物”等声音。而沂山派似乎准备不足，没能支撑太久，很快就四散而逃了。¤You hide in the distance and watch in secret, vaguely hearing the sounds of 'green-faced ghosts' and 'treasures'. The Mt. Yi Sect seemed ill-prepared and could not hold out for long, and soon fled in all directions.
沂山派与禾山道恶名在外，你可不想被卷进这场风波里。¤The Mt. Yi Sect and Mt. Harvest Sect are notorious and you don't want to get caught up in the furore.
隐蔽洞窟¤Hidden Cave
你在一处陡峭的崖壁上发现了一个洞窟，洞口的位置很隐蔽，看来这会是一个不错的休息场所。你决定...？¤You find a cave in a steep cliff face with a hidden entrance, and it looks like it will be a good place to rest. You decide to...?
休息一天¤Rest for the day
继续赶路¤Continue on your way
天魔眼内处处都是危机，你还是决定在这为数不多的安全区域好好休息一番，恢复一下状态。¤There are crises everywhere within the Heavenly Demon Eye, so you decide to take a good rest and recover in one of the few safe areas.
天魔眼每次只开放一个月，你不想把这珍贵的时间白白浪费，便转身离开了。¤The Eye of Heavenly Demons is only open for a month at a time, and not wanting to waste this precious time, you turn to leave.
随着你深入洞窟，阵阵野兽特有的腥膻气味扑面而来。看来，并不只有你一个人发现了这个洞窟...¤As you delve deeper into the cave, the distinctive fishy smell of wild animals hits you. It seems that you are not the only one who has discovered this cave...

古神教崇拜上古魔神，妄图借诛仙剑阵之威能，融合各种神兽精血，以完成宗门秘法。他们隐忍布局上千年，只为集齐四柄魔剑与神兽精血。\n\n天魔道长期潜伏于宁州，终于收集到了天魔仍然被封印在天魔眼中心的情报。他们派出众多高手围攻玄道宗，只为进入天魔眼核心区域，复活天魔。\n\n血剑宫对四柄魔剑觊觎已久，千年前在得知御剑门大战的情报后，第一时间便赶到宁州想要调查魔剑的下落，也因此救下了重伤的凌轩。当白帝放出戮仙剑被封印在白帝楼的传闻后，他们便开始寻找夺走此剑的机会。¤The Ancient Gods Cult worshiped the ancient demon gods, in a vain attempt to borrow the power of Array of the Immortal Killing Sword and fuse the essence blood of various divine beasts in order to complete the sect's secret method. They have held back the layout for thousands of years, only to gather the four devil swords and divine beast essence blood. The \n\n Heavenly Demon Dao had been lurking in Ningzhou for a long time and finally gathered the information that the Heavenly Demon was still sealed in the center of the Heavenly Demon Eye. They sent many experts to besiege the Mystic Dao Sect just to enter the core area of the Heavenly Demon Eye and resurrect the Heavenly Demon. The \n\n Blood Sword Palace has long coveted the four magic swords. A thousand years ago, after learning the information about the Great War of the Imperial Sword Sect, the first time they rushed to Ningzhou to try to investigate the whereabouts of the magic swords, and thus saved the seriously injured Ling Xuan. When the White Emperor released the rumor that the Immortal Executing Sword was sealed in the White Emperor Pavilion, they began to look for the opportunity to take away this sword.
御剑门之谜¤The Mystery of the Imperial Sword Sect
古神教收服魔剑失败，于是设计在魔剑内留下魔神蛊，在魏无极炼化魔剑时将魔神蛊偷偷植入他的体内。离开古迹后，古神教利用在离火门内安插的弟子散布御剑门私通魔门的传闻。最终五大门派高手围攻御剑门，宗门毁于一旦。¤The Ancient God Cult failed to take the Devil Sword, so they designed to leave the Devil God Compulsion inside the Devil Sword and secretly implanted it into Wei Wuji's body while he was refining the Devil Sword. After leaving the monument, the Ancient God Sect used the disciples planted within the Heavenly Fire Gate to spread rumors of the Imperial Sword Sect's involvement with the Demon Sect. Eventually the experts of the five major sects besieged the Royal Sword Sect and the sect was destroyed.

清晨，你路过一个山庄，里面传来阵阵习武呼和，显然是一个江湖门派。听到一声凄惨的大叫...{huanhang}“大师兄不好了，师傅闭死关，没有突破先天武者成为仙师，寿元已尽了。”{huanhang}“什么，我巨鲸门没有先天强者坐镇，天狼帮的人一定会打上门来的。”{huanhang}“不要自乱阵脚，我们先安排师傅的后事。”{huanhang}“哈哈哈，有什么好安排的一起下去陪那个老东西吧。”{huanhang}“啊？天狼帮的人来了”{huanhang}“你们欺人太甚！”...¤Early in the morning, you pass by a mountain villa, inside comes a burst of practice martial arts call and, apparently, a Jianghu sect. Hear a miserable shout... {huanhang}'Big Brother is not good, the master closed the death, did not break through the innate martial artist to become an immortal master, the life span has run out.' {huanhang}'What, I have no innate powerhouse sitting in the Giant Whale Sect, the Skywolf Gang's people will definitely come to our door.' {huanhang}'Don't confuse yourself, let's first arrange for master's afterlife.' {huanhang}'Hahaha, what is there to arrange go down together with that old thing.' {huanhang}'Huh? The 'Wolf Gang is here' {huanhang} 'You are too deceitful!' ...
前方山路，一群禾山派似乎起了内讧。只见其中一个满身是血地向你奔来，虽然力竭栽倒，怀中扔紧抱着面色蜡黄的少女。{huanhang}后面几个禾山派煞神迅速围了上来。{huanhang}“闪开闪开，不要挡道，老子今天只要那两个小畜生的命！”¤Ahead of the mountain road, a group of Harvest Hill School seems to have infighting. I saw one of them running towards you covered in blood, although exhausted and fell down, throwing in his arms clinging to the waxy-faced young girl. {huanhang}A few of the Woosan faction Furies quickly surrounded them. {huanhang}'Get out of the way, don't get in the way, I just want the lives of those two little beasts today!'

The brother of the Wo Shan faction used to kill people like slaughter, but put down his butcher's knife in the face of his sister who was chosen as a sacrifice. He was seen as a betrayer who turned against the WoShan and took his sister with him to the end of his life. {The newest addition to the list is the newest addition to the list.

The old yellow sutra streamers in the temple rustle in the night breeze, and with this sound you fall asleep ...... {huanhang}When you wake up, the dilapidated house you stayed in last night suddenly becomes rich and beautiful, and the table in front of the Buddha statue is full of snacks and fresh fruits. The whole night sleep you are now hungry, looking at the case of tribute, you decided ...

一颗闪亮的流星自你面前划过，奇怪，白天也能见到这种天象吗？你定睛一看，一位金光万丈的修士乘着飞行法宝向附近的地面落去。细细数来，他身上单是显露出来的法宝便有十几件，俨然一个人型宝库。正是这些光辉让他看来活像颗流星，不过这位修士的境界似乎不高，不如...¤A bright shooting star streaks past you. You look at it and see a golden-hued Cultivator on a flying treasure descending towards the ground nearby. As you count, he has more than a dozen magic treasures on him alone, a treasure trove of human proportions. It was these glories that made him seem to live like a shooting star, but this Cultivator's realm did not seem to be as high as...

不知为何村落中的古塔下聚集了众多百姓，你虽身为修真者也难免产生好奇之心，便凑上前去一探究竟。靠近塔前一股浓重的焦糊气味迎面而来，原来此塔因监管不力导致火灾，目前还有许多旅客被困塔上。¤For some reason a large number of people have gathered under the ancient pagoda in the village, and even though you are a Cultivator you are inevitably curious, so you come forward to find out. As you approach the tower, you are greeted by a strong, burning smell. It turns out that a fire has been caused by poor supervision and there are still many travellers trapped in the tower.

“咔啦......”{huanhang}轻微的声响后，石壁上出现了一幅壁画。你原本只是想借石洞休息一下体力再启程赶路，却不小心触发了其中机关。你小心翼翼地触摸壁画，死气沉沉的画像泛起一波涟漪，将你吸入其内。画中空间明朗开阔，或许是某位大能开辟的洞府。环视四周后，你决定带走......¤“Click......”{huanhang}After a slight sound, a fresco appears on the stone wall. You originally just wanted to use the cave to rest your strength before setting off on your journey, but you accidentally triggered one of the mechanisms. You cautiously touch the mural, the deadly portrait ripples and draws you into it. The space in the painting is bright and open, perhaps a cave opened up by some great power. After looking around, you decide to take away ......

什么都不拿¤Take nothing
你路过一个街边茶馆，百姓们围绕着一位精神矍铄的老人坐成一圈。{huanhang}“一凡先生今日讲甚么故事？”{huanhang}“要我说先生讲那万物复苏时节才最精彩！”{huanhang}你听了一阵，一凡先生醒木一拍，清了清嗓似要开讲。¤You pass by a street teahouse where the people sit in a circle around a hale and hearty old man. {huanhang}'What story is Mr. Yifan telling today?' {huanhang}'I'd say you're telling the best stories about the time when everything comes back to life!' {huanhang}You listened for a while, and Mr. Yifan woke up with a clap of wood and cleared his throat as if to speak.
坐下吃茶¤Sit down and eat your tea
“救命！不要啊！”前不着村后不着店，忽然听得一阵娇声呼救，似乎是女子声音。{huanhang}寻声而去，只见一位二八佳人被几个神色猥琐的劫匪逐渐围拢，吓得花颜失色。{huanhang}“哟，这位姑娘，您是要去哪里呀？这荒郊野地的要是遇到妖怪，那就可惜了你这水灵灵的模样。还好我们哥几个怜香惜玉，啧啧啧……”{huanhang}眼看着这几人就要图谋不轨，潜伏在侧的你下定了决心：¤Help! Don't! Without going to the village or back to the store, he suddenly heard a delicate voice calling for help, which seemed to be a woman's voice. {huanhang} went looking for the sound, only to see a 28-year-old beauty gradually surrounded by several wretched-looking robbers, her face paled in fright. {huanhang} ''Hey, girl, where are you going? If you encounter monsters in the wilderness, it will be a pity for your watery appearance. Fortunately, our brothers are sympathetic to each other, tsk tsk tsk... ''{huanhang}Seeing that these people are about to plot evil, you who are lurking by the side have made up your mind:
静观其变¤Watching in silence
强忍冲动的你决定再观察片刻。只见劫匪已将姑娘绑在树上。几人划拳良久，终于骂骂咧咧地排定了顺序。拔得头筹的壮汉一脸坏笑，朝着姑娘走去……{huanhang}正当你觉得难以入目之时，只听得一声惨叫，那大汉竟然歪倒在一旁。在旁划拳的匪徒们赶忙来救，却在一瞬之间被左右窜出的藤蔓裹挟。尖利的棘刺无孔不入，绿色的囚牢里哀嚎不断。{huanhang}方才那楚楚可怜的弱女子，如今却显露出树妖本尊。盘根错节的树干上，挂着一副姣好的皮囊，向你投来瘆人的笑意。¤Resisting the urge, you decide to observe for a few more moments. Only to see that the robbers have tied the girl to a tree. Several people paddled for a long time, finally cursing and cursing to arrange the order. The strong man who came out on top had a bad smile on his face and walked towards the girl ......{huanhang} Just when you found it hard to get in, you heard a scream and the big man actually fell on his side. The bandits paddling by the side rushed to the rescue, but in a flash were wrapped in vines that sprang up left and right. The sharp thorns are pervasive, and the green prison wails incessantly. The {huanhang} is a poor, weak woman, but now reveals her true nature as a tree demon. The trunk of the coiled tree, hanging a pair of beautiful skin, cast a creepy smile at you.
斩妖除魔¤kill the demons and get rid of them
多行不义¤Doing more than your fair share of injustice
是日，你于山间行走时忽然传来阵阵雷鸣。抬头望去，原来不远处有一片浓厚的雷云正在凝聚。没想到竟能遇上大能突破，你决定.....¤It is a day when you are walking in the mountains when suddenly there is a clap of thunder. When you look up, you see a thick thunder cloud gathering not far away. Not expecting to encounter a powerful breakthrough, you decide to .....

速速离去¤Get out of the way quickly
恰逢满月，你在林间休憩时不由得抬头凝望这姣美的圆月。月色皎洁，你心神一动，眼前忽地出现了一座精致无比的玉宇琼楼。{huanhang}此楼美轮美奂，雕梁画栋，宛如金玉铸就，在朦胧月光的映照下散发出柔和的光晕。¤When the moon is full, you can't help but gaze up at the beautiful full moon while resting in the forest. The moon is bright, you are moved, and suddenly there is an exquisite jade building in front of you. {huanhang}This building is beautiful, with carved beams and painted pillars, just like gold and jade, and emits a soft glow under the hazy moonlight.

冥冥之中你来到一处陡峭谷底，花团锦簇，落英缤纷。谷内生长着许多珍奇灵药，你一时心喜，但多年来养成的谨慎习惯令你没有贸然上前。{huanhang}你仔细地探查了一下，发现此地除却灵药，还有着大量的毒虫。心中一惊，你决定...¤In the dark you come to the bottom of a steep valley, with flowers and flowing petals. The valley is home to many rare and exotic medicines, and you are happy for a moment, but the cautious habits you have developed over the years have kept you from rushing forward. {huanhang}The first thing you need to do is to look into the area and find that there are a lot of poisonous insects in addition to spiritual medicines.

“前辈，有魔修霍乱此地，大肆屠杀无辜修士百姓。我观前辈气度不凡，定有大神通！恳请前辈出手降服魔修！”{huanhang}一位衣衫褴褛的炼气期修士踉踉跄跄地朝你奔来，他身后似乎有着浓重的魔气来袭。¤Senior, there are evil cultivators who are disrupting this place, massacring innocent cultivators and people.

敬而远之¤Stay Away
你刚走进洞窟，引力突然变大，还没等你反应过来，就把你拉扯到了洞窟深处。你被牢牢地吸在了一处山壁上，动弹不得...{huanhang}几天之后，这吸力才渐渐消失。放眼望去，只见洞窟之中，遍地都是禽类尸骨，其中不乏一些修为尚浅的妖兽。你不敢逗留，从几具妖兽的尸体中取出它们的妖丹，然后飞快的逃离了此地。¤You have just walked into the cave when the gravitational force suddenly becomes stronger, and before you can react, it pulls you deeper into the cave. You were firmly sucked into a wall and could not move... {huanhang}A few days later, the suction force faded away. You can see that the cave is filled with avian bones, including some Spirit Beasts of still shallow cultivation. You dare not stay, take out their demon pills from the corpses of several Spirit Beasts, and then fly away from here.
你谨慎地检查了这具尸体，发现他是身中剧毒而亡，看来这天地灵宝果然不是这么好采摘的，一定另有玄机。你将尸骨旁的储物袋收下，便小心翼翼的离开了。{huanhang}灵石+300¤You examined the corpse cautiously and found that he died of a severe poison. It seems that this heaven and earth spiritual treasure is really not so easy to pick, there must be another mystery.

那天狼帮主也不过一名先天武者，怎是你一合之敌？你三两招就重伤击退了他，巨鲸门上下感激涕零，其大师兄将镇门之宝赠与你。{huanhang}获得：幻心草¤That wolf gang master is only an innate martial artist, how can he be your opponent?

面对你的义正词严，哥哥惨然一笑，忽然将奄奄一息的妹妹推下悬崖。还未等你回过神来，便拔剑自刎，求仁得仁。{huanhang}简单掩埋之后，唏嘘的你继续上路。\\u83b7得：精铁符剑¤In the face of your righteousness, The older brother smiled tragically and suddenly pushed his dying sister off the cliff. Before you can come back to your senses, He drew a sword and killed himself, seeking atonement. {huanhang}After a simple burial, sighing you continue on your way. \\\u83b7Got: Fine Iron Rune Sword
千恩万谢之后，你们在下个路口分道扬镳。你留给他们一些盘缠，希望他们能活得轻松一些——在再次被追杀之前。{huanhang}心境+2¤After a thousand thanks, you go your separate ways at the next intersection. You leave them some coins and hope they live a little easier - before being hunted again. {huanhang} Mind +2
你抓起碟中的糕点便往嘴里塞去，入口却并无香甜味道，只觉如同嚼蜡。感到疑惑的同时你盯着手里的点心，一阵恍惚间再次睁开双眼，原来一切只是一场梦。至于食物从何而来......你低下头，一眼看到了掌中紧握的草席。{huanhang}心境-3¤You grabbed the pastry in the plate and stuffed it into your mouth, but there was no sweet taste in your mouth, just like chewing wax.

The raging fire quickly succumbs to your spell, and as a token of gratitude for saving them, the trapped citizens offer you some treasures. {huanhang} You receive 300 Spirit stones.
人各有命数，你并不打算干涉他们的人生。正当你准备继续赶路时，一位衣着简朴的青年人站了出来：“在下张有忌，若各位信得过的话可依次从塔上跳下，我会接住你们！”这个办法可信度实在太低，你摇了摇头匆匆前往下一个目的地。{huanhang}心境+3¤People have their own destiny, and you do not intend to interfere with their lives. Just as you are about to continue your journey, a young man dressed in simple clothes comes forward: 'I am Zhang Youji, if you trust you can jump from the tower in turn, I will catch you!'

After walking out of the portrait, you find that the paper instantly turns into flying ash, and you can't help but feel the wonder of all the world's laws. {huanhang}Mind +6
拉开木凳坐在一旁，你向小二要了杯茶，侧耳倾听一凡先生的故事。{huanhang}\n“白熊登上了海岸，无所畏惧地漫步在冰原上，开始了一段艰苦的冒险经历......”{huanhang}一凡先生的故事生动多姿，你沉浸在故事中时突然体悟到自然之趣。{huanhang}灵石-50 思绪+1¤Pulling aside a wooden stool to sit on, you ask for a cup of tea and listen sideways to Mr. Yifan's story. {huanhang}\n 'The white bear ascended the coast and fearlessly strolled across the ice field, embarking on a grueling adventure ......' {huanhang}Mr. Yifan's story is so vivid and colorful that you suddenly realize the joy of nature as you immerse yourself in the story. {huanhang}Spiritual Stone-50 Thoughts +1
凡人的故事再奇妙也不如修真世界多彩，你想了想还是决定继续赶路。\n{huanhang}心境+10¤The stories of mortals are no more fantastic than the colorful world of cultivation, and you think about it and decide to continue on your way. \n{huanhang}Mindfulness+10
哪来的小子，败了老子们的兴，快滚！¤Where are you from, you're ruining the fun of the old men, get lost!
嘿嘿嘿，又一块年轻血肉，真是香甜……¤Hey, hey, hey, another piece of young flesh, it smells so sweet ......
人心险恶，这些劫匪也是咎由自取，你无视了刺耳的求救声，拂袖而去。{huanhang}心境+1¤The human heart is vicious, and these robbers are to blame. You ignore the shrill pleas for help and brush them away. {huanhang}Mindfulness +1
你就近找了个山洞，打算借此机会仔细观摩一下雷劫。只见雷云愈积愈厚，遮天蔽日的乌云间电光涌动，似是在积蓄第一道雷劫。{huanhang}你又等了半晌，一道粗如水蛇的雷电猛地从空中劈下，那一瞬间似乎有什么从你的脑海中掠过。你记下这微妙的感悟，准备回到静处再细细感悟。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You found a cave nearby, intend to take the opportunity to carefully observe the thunderstorm. The first time you see a thundercloud getting thicker and thicker, the lightning surges between the dark clouds that cover the sky, seemingly in the accumulation of the first thunderstorm. {huanhang}You waited for a long time, and then a lightning bolt as thick as a water snake slashed down from the air, and something seemed to pass through your mind at that moment. You take note of this subtle insight and prepare to return to the quiet place to feel it more carefully. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你认为此事没什么值得留意的，毕竟终有一天你也会踏上相同的道路。{huanhang}偶然遇到的雷劫令你的道心愈发稳固，你似乎对大道的感悟加深了几分。{huanhang}心境+10¤You think it's nothing worth noticing, after all, one day you'll be on the same path. {huanhang}The chance encounter with the thunderstorm made your dao heart more and more solid, and you seem to have deepened your perception of the dao by a few points. {huanhang}Mindfulness +10
你走上前去，宫殿墙壁上繁杂的花纹愈发清晰，你揣摩着上面刻画的图案，其中好像蕴含着不小的道意。{huanhang}你默默地把这些图画记在了心里，就在此时楼宇忽地消失，像是从未出现过一般。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You walk up to the palace walls, the intricate patterns on the palace walls become clearer and clearer, and you speculate on the patterns carved on them, which seem to contain no small amount of daoist meaning. {huanhang}You silently took these pictures to heart, and just then the building suddenly disappeared, as if it had never existed. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你心神合一，不为眼前的景象所动。那楼阁不消多久便如同来时一般，在你的视野中突然消失了。{huanhang}这或许是哪位大能开辟的随身仙府吧......{huanhang}心境+10¤Your mind is united and you are not moved by the sight before you. The pavilion did not take long to disappear as suddenly as it came in your vision. {huanhang}This is perhaps a portable immortal residence opened by some great power ...... {huanhang}Mindfulness +10
你一时怒从中来，既气又恨。气自己时运不济，误入此妖领地。更恨自己实力不足，无法将此妖斩于剑下。{huanhang}气血翻涌间你杀意大盛，堪堪领悟一丝剑道法门，你抓住这一瞬的体悟挥剑而出，一击将那天青翼蛇斩杀。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You momentarily anger from it, both angry and hate. Angry at yourself for being unlucky and entering this demon's territory by mistake. The actual fact is that you will not be able to get the best out of this demon. {huanhang}The blood and vitality surged and your killing intent was so strong that you were able to comprehend a hint of the sword dao. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你心道保命要紧，脚下步法愈发迅捷，在长达三日的追逐后你的遁术有所精进，总算逃离了天青翼蛇的追逐。{huanhang}你松了一口气，将这次的感悟记在心中，打算得空时再雕琢遁术。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You are able to keep your life, and your footwork becomes more and more rapid. After three days of chasing you, your vanishment skills have improved, and you finally escaped the chase of the Sky Green Winged Snake. {huanhang}You are relieved and take your insights to heart, planning to refine your evasion technique when you have time. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
对二人的观点没什么灵感的你，怕是加入讨论也无法求得一个圆满的结果。{huanhang}你看得通透，径直离开了此地。{huanhang}心境+10¤You are not inspired by the views of the two, and you are afraid that joining the discussion will not lead to a successful outcome. {huanhang}You see things clearly and leave the place straight away. {huanhang}Mindfulness +10
你一时兴起，从藏身处走出加入论道。那两名修士也不排斥，见你加入争先恐后地把各自的观点分享给你，希望你评个高低。{huanhang}你左思右想，将二人的体悟糅合起来，成就了另一番心得。两位修士得了满意的结果，心满意足地拜别了你。{huanhang}思绪+1¤On a whim, you come out of your hiding place to join the discussion. The two cultivators did not reject you, and when they saw you join them, they were eager to share their views with you, hoping you would judge them. {huanhang}You have been thinking about it for a long time, and you have combined their perceptions to create another insight. The two cultivators were satisfied with the results and bid you farewell with satisfaction. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你本就不擅长炼丹，贸然上前怕是会落人笑柄。甚么宁心花夜交藤，在你眼中都长着一个样子。你摇了摇头离开此地，这份豁达心性倒是难得。{huanhang}心境+10¤You are not good at alchemy, rashly up to fear that it will be a laughing stock. What Ningxin flower night cross vine, in your eyes are growing a look. You shook your head to leave this place, this open-mindedness is rare. {huanhang}Mindfulness +10
“道友之惑，我倒是有些心得体悟。”{huanhang}你走上前去，将自己的炼药心得分享给他。这宁神花只有作为辅药时才有凝神之效，自然无法成为丹方的主药。你二人兴致正高，又接连讨论了几味草药的药性才作罢。{huanhang}思绪+1¤Daoist friend's confusion, I do have some insights Earth.' {huanhang}You walk up and share your pill-making insights with him. This Ning Shen flower only has the effect of condensing the mind when used as a supplementary medicine, naturally it cannot be the main medicine of the dan recipe. The two of you were in high spirits and discussed the medicinal properties of a few more herbs one after another before calling it quits. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你并不在意这细小的声响，只把心思放在求道上。很快，你便忽视了那个声音沉浸在修炼中。{huanhang}修为+500¤You don't care about the small sound, and only focus your mind on seeking the Way. Soon, you ignore the voice and immerse yourself in your cultivation. {huanhang}Cultivation +500
很快你便找到了声音的来源，山涧中一块锥状石柱不停地向下滴水，落在下方的石块上。那石块经过水滴的侵蚀已经出现了深深的凹坑，你看着水滴断断续续地落下，数十年如一日以微薄之力撼石，心中似乎有一丝明悟。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You soon found the source of the sound, a cone-shaped stone pillar in the mountain stream kept dripping water downward, falling on the stone below. The stone has been eroded by the water drops and deep craters have appeared. You watch the water drops fall intermittently, shaking the stone with a meager force for decades, and there seems to be a glimmer of enlightenment in your heart. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
风之所以消散，是因为受到山脉的阻拦。守静者，土之道也，你仰头望着厚重绵延的高山，脑海中豁然贯通，窥探到一丝土之道的法门。你将此刻的感悟记在心里，打算找个时间再细细消化。{huanhang}思绪+1¤The reason why the wind dissipates is because it is blocked by the mountains. You look up at the thick, rolling mountains, and your mind opens up to a glimpse of the way of the earth. You will take this moment of insight into your heart and intend to find time to digest it in detail. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
山脉之所以巨大，不仅因为地势走向，更因不拒细小的土石。积土成山，非斯须之作。你若有所思，对土之道有了新的想法。{huanhang}思绪+1¤The reason why the mountains are huge is not only because of the direction of the terrain, but also because they do not reject the smallest earth and rocks. The accumulation of earth into a mountain is not the work of Sisu. You think about it and have a new idea about the way of the earth. {huanhang}thought +1
你对此阵法倒是有些兴趣，便依着平日积累的阵法知识推演起此阵的来历。历时几日，你总算靠着自己的力量解除了这个阵法，但草药已经被不知名的修士采走了。好在这次的经历让你多了一些阵法方面的体悟。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You are a little interested in this formation, so you rely on the formation knowledge accumulated during the day to deduce the origin of this formation. After a few days, you finally dismantled the formation by your own power, but the herbs had been taken away by unknown cultivators. The good thing is that this experience has given you some more Earth of the formation. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你看准了阵法的薄弱之处，祭起法宝朝那处狠狠攻去。只听喀啦一声，支撑着迷阵的阵眼之旗碎裂开来。¤You see a weak spot in the formation and offer up a magic treasure to strike that spot hard. Only a click was heard, and the flag of the formation eye supporting the maze array shattered open.
你对自己的实力十分有信心，这谷内的毒物想必不会对你造成多大的威胁。为了其中灵药，你决定深入谷内。没走多远，一只巨大的毒蝎晃着尾刺向你袭来...¤You are confident in your own strength, and the poisonous creatures in this valley must not pose much of a threat to you. For the sake of the spiritual medicine in it, you decide to go deeper into the valley. You don't get very far when a huge poisonous scorpion comes at you with its tail sting...
你望了望谷内的毒虫，决定还是不要以身犯险。谷口处也有不少的灵药，你采下几株，毫不留恋地离开了这里。{huanhang}草药+3¤You looked at the poisonous insects in the valley and decided it was better not to take the risk with your body. There were also quite a few Pills at the mouth of the valley, and you picked a few and left the place without a second thought. {huanhang} Herbs +3
你将外袍收入储物囊，穿着中衣坐进了浅池中。温热的池水浸润着你的身体，将你赶路的疲累困顿全部除去。¤You put your outer robe into your storage pouch and sit in the shallow pool in your midriff. The warm water soaks into your body, removing all the fatigue and sleep from your journey.
你没有贸然上前，只是远远地看着这一片奇特的池水。温热的池水上下翻涌，你似乎捕捉到了一丝与常识大相径庭的灵光。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You did not rashly go forward, but simply looked at the strange pool of water from a distance. The warm pool water churned up and down, and you seemed to catch a glimpse of an Qi that was very different from common sense. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你有些看不过去，直接用神识震慑住了这两位炼气后期的弟子，并问过他们于此争斗的前因后果。原来是这师兄记错了英杰会的日期，导致二人没能赶上比赛...你不禁啼笑皆非，劝诫二人同门应多多照应。{huanhang}此事让你想起几十年前你炼气期时少年风发的模样，一时感慨颇多。{huanhang}心境+30¤You couldn't overlook the matter, you used your Soul Sense to intimidate the two late stage Qi refining disciples, and asked the reason for their argument. It turned out that the senior disciple had misremembered the date of the Young Hero's Tournament, so they could not make it to the competition... You can't help but laugh as you admonish the two fellow disciples to take better care of each other. {You were reminded of your youth when you were in the Qi refining stage decades ago, and you felt a lot of different emotions. {huanhang}Mindfulness +30
你身为金丹修士，不好插手小辈之事，便隐藏起来观察二人斗法。平日你甚少同玄道宗弟子交手，此师兄弟招式来去间你在这玄道宗的功法中揣摩到了一些新的体悟。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You are a Golden Core Cultivator, not good to intervene in the affairs of juniors, they will be hidden to observe the two fighting. The usual day you rarely fight with Mystic Dao Sect disciples, this master brother moves to and fro between you in this Mystic Dao Sect's gong method to figure out some new understanding.{huanhang}Thinking +1
你走向瀑布中心盘膝而坐，任由激荡的水流冲刷躯体。强大的冲击力令你的筋骨结实了许多，让你心生明悟之意。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You walk towards the center of the waterfall and sit cross-legged, letting the stirring water wash over your body. The powerful impact makes your muscles and bones much stronger and gives you a sense of enlightenment. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你望着势若飞虹的水流，感受着其中蕴含的力量与气势。瀑布穿天透地不辞劳，清潭天光云影共徘徊，你透过此景领悟到了水的柔与刚。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You look at the water flowing like a flying rainbow, feeling the power and momentum contained in it. The waterfall penetrates the sky and the earth, and the clear pond hovers in the sky and the clouds, through which you understand the softness and rigidity of water. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
多行不义必自毙，你义不容辞地祭出法宝。紧随而来的魔修见你修为远超与他不敢造次，刚要施展血遁术逃命便被你一剑捅了个透心凉。{huanhang}此地幸免于难的修士与百姓为了感谢你，筹备出不少灵石。{huanhang}灵石+600¤More acts of injustice will kill themselves, you are obliged to sacrifice magic treasures. The evil cultivator who came close behind saw that your cultivation was far superior to his and did not dare to make a move, just to cast a bloodline mobility technique to escape and was stabbed by you with a sword. {huanhang}The people and the cultivators who were spared from the disaster here prepared a lot of spiritual stones to thank you. {huanhang}Spiritual stones +600
你摆了摆手，示意并不想参与进这些斗争中。多一事不如少一事，在那魔修赶到前你连忙离开了此地。¤You wave your hand, signalling that you do not want to get involved in these struggles. More is better than less, and you leave the place before the evil cultivator arrives.
你见客栈外热闹非凡，一时凡心大起步入街市，从街头游到街尾，买了许多特色小吃才作罢。时隔多年你再次体会到做凡人的感觉，不禁感慨颇多。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You see the inn outside the bustling, a moment of mortal heart to step into the market, from the streets to the end of the street, buy a lot of special snacks before you stop. You can't help but feel a lot of emotion when you experience the feeling of being a mortal again after so many years. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
结庐在人境，而无车马喧。你虽身处闹市，却灵台清明，道心坚定。红尘俗世的消遣已离你远去，你闭上双眼进入修练状态，自有一番志趣。{huanhang}心境+40¤The hut is in the human realm, and there is no noise of horses and cars. Although you are in the downtown, but the spiritual platform is clear, the Taoist heart is firm. The pastimes of the mundane world have left you, and you close your eyes and enter a state of cultivation, with your own ambition. {huanhang}Mindfulness+40
你恐有大变，急忙运起灵气逃离了此地。不久只听轰隆一声，方才你途经之地已被浓厚的山灰覆盖。¤Fearing that something might change, you hurriedly ran away with your Qi. Soon you heard a rumble and the place you had just passed was covered in thick mountain ash.
不知是奇宝出世还是山体崩塌，你对此十分好奇，便找了个山洞谨慎地观察着颤动的峰头。{huanhang}没过多久，大量的山灰伴随震耳欲聋的声音喷薄而出，原本覆盖着白雪的山峰顷刻便淌满了赤红的岩浆。你虽相隔一段距离，仍被这滚烫的山灰波及，一身道袍褴褛万分，只得灰头土脸地离开了。{huanhang}思绪+1¤I don't know if it's a strange treasure or a mountain collapse, you're very curious about it, so you find a cave and cautiously observe the trembling peaks. {huanhang}It didn't take long for a large amount of mountain ash to spill out along with deafening sounds, and the snow-covered peaks were instantly dripping with crimson lava. You are some distance away from each other, but still by this hot mountain ash waves, a Taoist robe ragged million, only to gray head and face away. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
古树枝干繁茂，耸入云天。你费了九牛二虎之力窜上树顶，感觉自己的遁术得到了不小的提升。{huanhang}思绪+1¤The ancient tree with its luxuriant branches towers into the clouds. You took the effort to scamper up to the top of the tree, feeling that your vanishment skills had been enhanced considerably. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
你望着树木遒劲庞杂的枝干，在一片绿意中领悟到些许万木生长的奥妙。{huanhang}思绪+1¤You look at the trees' strong, ponderous branches and realize some of the wonders of the growth of all the trees in a greenery. {huanhang}Thoughts +1
眼见后来者可能要对那女性修士不利，你决定追上去一看究竟。¤Seeing that the later may be detrimental to the female Vagrant Cultivator, you decide to go after her to see what is going on.
修仙不易，还是少管闲事为妙。（心境+10）¤It is not easy to cultivate immortality, so it is better to mind your own business. （Mind +10）
拿定主意后，你驱动遁术疾驰而去。¤Having made up your mind, you begin to chase after them with your transporation technique.
你想起上次并不愉快的经历，深觉修仙者大都性格怪异，还是少招惹为妙。（心境+10）¤Remembering your last unpleasant experience, you realize that most immortal cultivators have strange personalities and it is better to avoid them. （Mind +10）

等待剩下的草药慢慢成熟还需要一段不短的时间，若是遇到其他修士或是妖兽又免不了一场恶战。你不愿冒此风险，将已经成熟的几株草药摘走后，便转身离开了。¤It will take some time for the rest of the herbs to mature, and if you encounter other Cultivator or Spirit Beasts, you will be in for a nasty fight. Not wanting to take the risk, you picked the few herbs that had already ripened and then turned around and left.

Should you gather your breath and find a place to hide, or spend some time setting up a formation to mask the smell of the immortal herbs...?

{qianbei}此举真如干天落慈雨，解我心头大患，多谢！¤{qianbei} This move is really like the rain of mercy falling on the dry sky, which solves my heart's troubles, thank you!

哎，这{item}不过身外之物，便交给{qianbei}吧。¤Hey, this {item} is just something outside of the body, so leave it to {qianbei}.
本以为{qianbei}是我知音，没想到竟是如此贪婪之徒。¤I thought {qianbei} was my confidant, but I didn't expect to be such a greedy person.
死生有命，修短素定，非尔威胁所能损益，这{item}我不会给的。¤I will not give this {item} to you.
{item}价值虽高，也不过身外之物，拿去吧。¤I'm not going to give it to you, but even though it's worth a lot, it's just something outside of your body.
修仙本就是机缘险中求，又怎么会因区区威胁便轻易相送此等宝物！¤I'm not going to give it away because of a mere threat.
修仙本就是机缘险中求，又怎么会轻易相送此等宝物！¤I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get a good deal on this.
{miji}不过身外之物，{FirstName}{daoyou}既然开口了，我自然不会推脱。¤{miji}But it's just something outside of my body, {FirstName}{daoyou}I'm not going to say no since I asked for it.
此间有山间清风，天上明月与壶中美酒，{FirstName}{qianbei}何必执着于{miji}呢？¤There is a breeze in the Mountains, the bright moon in the sky and the wine in the pot. {First name}{qianbei} why bother to cling to {miji}?
怀璧于身不外露，立身之本怎轻传，{qianbei}还是学其他的吧。¤Huaibi is not exposed to the body, how can the foundation of standing up be passed down lightly, {qianbei} Let's learn something else.
现下无事，{qianbei}可愿与我探讨一番这天地大道？¤There is nothing wrong now, {qianbei} would you like to discuss the avenue of heaven and earth with me?
经{qianbei}指点，如醍醐灌顶，使晚辈茅塞顿开。¤Under the guidance of {qianbei}, it is like a wake-up call to the top, which makes the juniors open up.
多谢{qianbei}指点，毋需挂心。¤Thank you {qianbei} for your guidance, don't worry.
只是探讨而已，{qianbei}不用在意。¤It's just a discussion, {qianbei} don't care.
我新学了一门神通，{qianbei}可有空陪我练练手？¤I have learned a new psychic, {qianbei} Can you accompany me to practice your hands when you have time?
好，以后游历中有什么见闻也方便与{qianbei}分享。¤Okay, it is also convenient to share with {qianbei} if you have any insights or insights during your future travels.
我答应你！从今往后...你若不离，我便不弃！¤I promise you! From now on... If you don't leave, I won't give up!
太好了！我答应你...山无陵，江水为竭，冬雷震震，夏雨雪，天地合，乃敢与君绝！¤Great! I promise you... There are no hills, no rivers, no thunder in winter, no rain in summer, no snow in summer.
呃，你可能误会了什么...我只是把你当作普通朋友啊！¤Uh, you may have misunderstood something. . . I just treat you as an ordinary friend!
抱歉，尽管我们如此亲密，但我们真的只是朋友...对不起...我们还能做朋友吗？¤I'm sorry, even though we're so close, we're really just friends... I'm sorry... Can we still be friends?
什么？{qianbei}是认真的么？¤What? Is {qianbei} serious?
好家伙，我直接好家伙。¤Good guys, I'm straight up good guys.
哈哈哈，{qianbei}邀约，在下怎敢拒绝。¤Hahaha, {qianbei} invite, how dare you refuse.
{daoyou}，有什么事吗？但说无妨。¤{daoyou}, what can I do for you? But there is no harm in saying so.
全力以赴吧，莫让为师小瞧你。¤Go all out, don't let your teacher underestimate you.
不错，徒儿终于还是出息了。¤Yes, the disciple is finally out.
不错，看来为师还够资格指点你。¤Yes, it seems that the teacher is qualified enough to guide you.
{qianbei}，尽管出手吧！¤{qianbei}, go ahead!
不愧是{qianbei}！¤As expected of {qianbei}!
哈哈，承蒙{qianbei}抬爱了。¤Haha, thanks to {qianbei}.
{daoyou}怎么想起打听这个了？我听说这御剑门数百年前就覆灭了，或许只有那些曾经经历过此事的前辈们才知道当年到底发生了什么。¤{daoyou}Why did you remember to inquire about this? I heard that this Royal Sword Sect was overturned hundreds of years ago, perhaps only those seniors who have experienced this matter will know what really happened back then.
啊...我也不太清楚。这个对{daoyou}来说很重要么？¤Ah... I'm not really sure. Is this important to {daoyou}?
哈哈哈，{daoyou}相邀，我怎会拒绝。¤Hahahaha, {daoyou} invited me, how could I refuse?
千年修为，只为今朝，毕生苦修，成败在此一举！{daoyou}，定要成功！¤Thousands of years of cultivation, just for this day, a lifetime of hard work, success or failure! {daoyou} I'm going to succeed!

哇，竟然是{item}！这可是相当贵重的礼物，多谢{qianbei}！¤Wow, it turned out to be {item}! This is a very valuable gift, thank you {qianbei}!
这{item}虽然看着普通，不过既然是{qianbei}送的，一定非同寻常！¤Although this {item} looks ordinary, since it was sent by {qianbei}, it must be extraordinary!
怎么是个{item}...害我白高兴一场！¤Why is it a {item}? I was so happy!
还好只是{item}，没有亏太多，嘿嘿。¤Luckily, it's just an {item}, so I didn't lose too much money, hehehe.
哎，为了{item}居然威胁我，真是令人伤心...伤心欲绝啊。¤It's so sad that I was threatened for {item}... It's so sad.
呵，{item}可不是仅凭两句威胁就能从我这拿走的凡物。¤Hehe, {item} is not a mere mortal thing that can be taken away from me with just two threats.
呜，这可是我的宝贝，哎哎哎，别动手，这就给你。¤Oooh, it's my treasure, hey hey hey, don't do it, it's yours.
呵，{item}可不是仅凭两句威胁就能从我这轻易拿走的凡物。¤Heh, {item} is not a mere mortal thing that can be easily taken from me with just two threats.
不过是{miji}，包在我身上了。¤But it's {miji}, I'll take care of it.
{FirstName}{qianbei}，白嫖可不好啊哈哈哈。¤{First name}{qianbei}, it's not good to prostitute for nothing, hahaha.
我{shili}严禁外传{miji}，可不是我不愿教你啊哈哈哈。¤I {shili} am strictly forbidden to pass on {miji}, not that I don't want to teach you hahaha.
哈，正想找个人论道就碰到了{qianbei}，不知{qianbei}可有时间指点我一番？¤Ha, I was looking for someone to discuss the Tao and ran into {qianbei}. I wonder if {qianbei} has time to point me out?

多谢{qianbei}，看来我与{qianbei}对悟道的差距，有亿点点多哈哈哈。¤Thank you {qianbei}, it seems that the gap between me and {qianbei} on Enlightening is 100 million points, haha.

哈，{qianbei}好久不见，可愿切磋一番增进下感情？¤Ha, {qianbei} It's been a long time since I saw you, would you like to learn from each other and improve your feelings?
太好了，我也正有此意，{qianbei}以后若有要事随时联系。除非有什么意外，不然我都会随时回复的，别紧张，我说的是闭关啦，我才没那么容易陨落哈哈哈。¤Great, I also have this intention, {qianbei} If you have any important matters in the future, feel free to contact. Unless there is any accident, I will reply at any time. Don't be nervous. I'm talking about retreat. I'm not that easy to fall hahaha.
好吧好吧，便宜你啦！¤Okay, okay, it's on you!
玩笑也不能这么开吧，{qianbei}好像不太聪明的样子。¤You can't joke around like that, {qianbei} doesn't seem very clever.
抱歉，虽然我真的很喜欢和你在一起的时光，但...但...不可以...对不起...¤I'm sorry, but as much as I really enjoyed my time with you... But... Can't... I'm sorry...
哈哈，{qianbei}不是在和我开玩笑吧？¤Haha, {qianbei} are you kidding me?
{daoyou}，你找我？什么事？什么事？¤{daoyou}, you wanted to see me? What's up? What is it?
即便是遇到了{qianbei}你，我也不会轻言放弃的！¤Even if I meet {qianbei} you, I won't give up lightly!
来吧。¤Come on.

不行。¤no.
{qianbei}，记得手下留情！¤{qianbei}, remember to show mercy!
咦？{daoyou}是找到了什么古代遗迹了么？¤Huh? Did {daoyou} find some ancient ruins?
能观摩{daoyou}渡劫？那太好了，我一定来！¤To be able to observe the {daoyou} tribulation? That's great, I'll definitely come!

明明是{qianbei}硬塞过来的，我...我才没有很想要。¤Obviously {qianbei} was stuck here, I. . . I didn't really want it.
这{item}倒也算得上是一件宝贝，我就收下了。¤This {item} is a treasure, so I'll accept it.
虽然{qianbei}送的礼物不合我心意，但也不必过于在意。毕竟我的品味不是谁都能领会的。¤Although the gift from {qianbei} is not my intention, I don't have to care too much. After all, not everyone can understand my taste.
这{item}你也送得出手？¤You can even give this {item} away?

别想了，就算这{miji}不是{shili}至高秘典，我也不会教你的。¤Don't even think about it, even if this {miji} wasn't the {shili} supreme secret Manual, I wouldn't teach it to you.
我最近在悟道时遇到一些瓶颈，{qianbei}可有时间指点一二？若是没空就算了，我自己也可以解决。¤I recently encountered some bottlenecks in Enlightening. Can {qianbei} have time to point out one or two? If there is no time, I can solve it myself.
刚好闲得无聊，便陪{qianbei}消磨一番吧。¤If you happen to be bored, just spend some time with {qianbei}.

哎，早就知道{qianbei}不靠谱，但没想到竟然会这么不靠谱。¤Hey, I knew that {qianbei} was unreliable a long time ago, but I didn't expect it to be so unreliable.
喂，我感觉自己稍有突破，但苦于找不到合适的人切磋，不如{qianbei}陪我练练手吧。¤Hey, I feel that I have made a slight breakthrough, but I am struggling to find the right person to learn from. It is better to {qianbei} to accompany me to practice my hands.
好，我也正有此意。不要误会，只是以后若有要事，方便{qianbei}与我联系而已。¤Well, I also have this intention. Don't get me wrong, it's just that if you have something important in the future, it's convenient for {qianbei} to contact me.
那...那我可得好好考虑考虑。你能先回答我几个问题么？¤Then... Then I'll have to think about it. Can you answer a few questions for me first?
好啦好啦...答应你了。别搞错了，我才不会对你有意思，只是一时想不到怎么拒绝你而已。¤Okay, okay... You're promised. Don't get me wrong, I'm not interested in you, I just couldn't think of a way to say no to you at the moment.
哼，真拿{qianbei}没办法。别搞错了，我才不会对你有意思，只是一时想不到怎么拒绝你而已。¤Hm, there's really nothing you can do about {qianbei}. Don't get me wrong, I'm not interested in you, I just couldn't think of a way to say no to you at the moment.
想多了吧，我和你可不熟...真是的，{qianbei}怎么是这种人。¤I don't know you very well... I don't know you very well...{qianbei} What kind of person is that?
抱歉，尽管、尽管...但我们真不适合...¤I'm sorry, though, though... But we really don't fit...
啊？{qianbei}是认真的么？¤Huh? Is {qianbei} serious?
{daoyou}，又，又来找我干嘛？¤{daoyou}, again, what are you doing with me again?

{qianbei}，别人怕你，我可不怕你。¤{qianbei}, others are afraid of you, but I am not afraid of you.
哼，不愧是{qianbei}。¤Hmph, as expected of {qianbei}.
哼，这可不像往日的{qianbei}。¤Hmm, this is not like the {qianbei} of the past.
御剑门？我对这种小门小派毫无兴趣，{daoyou}去找别人打听吧。¤The Royal Sword Sect? I have no interest in such small sects, {daoyou} go find someone else to inquire.
什么宁州古迹？没听说过。¤What Ningzhou monuments? Never heard of it.
好吧...既然{daoyou}特地来邀请了...¤Well... Since {daoyou} has come specifically to invite me...
别误会...我可没有被这天劫吓到...{daoyou}，你、你一定会成功的对吧...一定要成功啊！¤Don't get me wrong... I'm not intimidated by this heavenly disaster... {daoyou} You, you're going to make it, right... You're going to make it!
我可不是在担心...不过这天劫不可小觑，{daoyou}可别大意了。¤I'm not worried... But this heavenly Tribulation is not to be underestimated, {daoyou} don't be careless.
{daoyou}不必替我担心...这区区天劫我还不放在眼里。¤{daoyou} Don't worry about me... I don't care about this mere heavenly tribulation.
什么？难道我现在不好看嘛...哼，也不是不行啦，让我来看看吧~¤What? I don't look good now... Well, it's not that bad. Let's see.
什么？更换装扮？...好啦好啦，真拿你没办法，让我来看看吧。¤What? Change of costume? OK, OK, I can't help you, let me see.
才，才不是为了你才装扮成这样呢，是我自己喜欢而已...¤No, I didn't dress up like this for you. It's just that I like it...
说清楚啊，我可不是为了你才装扮成这样呢，是我自己喜欢而已，哼。¤I'm not dressing up like this for you, I'm just doing it for me.
称呼？哼，我倒要看看你要我称呼你什么~¤Called? I'd like to see what you want me to call you~
称呼？哼，我倒要看看你能取出什么好称呼。¤Called? Hmph, I'd like to see what good name you can take out.

双修？哼...欸！你慢一点啊！¤Dual cultivation? Hmm... Hey! Slow down a bit!
才，才没有喜欢和{daoyou}做这种事情呢。¤I didn't like doing that with {daoyou}.
这种事情，当真是没意思得很...过会继续如何？¤This kind of thing is really not interesting... How about continuing after the meeting?
太好了，我正好需要这{item}！¤That's great, I need this {item}!
{item}...{qianbei}的赠礼太贵重了，多谢{qianbei}。（可惜我暂时用不上...）¤{item}. . . {qianbei}'s gift is too valuable, thank you {qianbei}. (Unfortunately, I can't use it for the time being. . . ）
多谢{qianbei}的好意，只可惜我暂时用不上{item}。¤Thank you {qianbei} for your kindness, but it's a pity that I can't use {item} for the time being.

既然{qianbei}如此想要，我也只好把这{item}交给您了。¤Since {qianbei} wants it so much, I have to give this {item} to you.
{qianbei}此举是因为遇到了难以启齿的困境么？那这{item}便让你拿去罢。¤{qianbei} Is this move because of an unspeakable dilemma? Then let you take this {item}.
这{item}可是我视同生命的珍宝，怎会交给你！¤This {item} is a treasure that I hold dear to my heart, so I will not give it to you!
这{item}虽是贵重，但{qianbei}应该是有难言之隐才需要它吧。¤Although this {item} is valuable, {qianbei} should be in need of it because it is unspeakably hidden.
这{item}可是我视同生命的珍宝，怎会轻易交给你！¤This {item} is a treasure that I value as much as my life, so I wouldn't give it to you so easily!
这便是{FirstName}{qianbei}想要的{miji}了。¤This is what {first name}{qianbei} wants {miji}.
难得与{FirstName}{qianbei}一见，还是聊聊这宁州的逸闻趣事吧。¤It's rare to meet {first name}{qianbei}, so let's talk about the anecdotes of Ningzhou.
你我难得一见，还是不聊这枯涩的{miji}吧，莫要扫了{FirstName}{qianbei}的雅兴。¤It's rare for you and me to see each other. Let's not talk about this withered {miji}. Don't sweep up the elegance of {First name}{qianbei}.
我最近在悟道时陷入瓶颈，久坐枯死也无法突破，要是有人能指点我一番就好了。不知{qianbei}...¤I recently fell into a bottleneck in Enlightening, and I couldn't break through by sitting and dying for a long time. It would be great if someone could point me out. I don't know {qianbei}. . .
希望我的浅薄学识，可以给{qianbei}带来些许灵感。¤I hope that my shallow knowledge can bring some inspiration to {qianbei}.
多谢{qianbei}指点，此番真是获益匪浅。¤Thank you {qianbei} for your guidance. I have really benefited a lot this time.
对不起，是我拖{qianbei}后腿了。¤Sorry, I dragged {qianbei} back.

{qianbei}所想正合晚辈心意，以后多多联系。¤{qianbei} I think it fits the younger generation's mind, so I will contact you more in the future.
我...我答应你...我会温柔待你的...也请{qianbei}...温柔待我...¤I... I... I promise you... I will be gentle with you... And please {qianbei}... Treat me gently...
太好了...我...我也对{qianbei}倾慕已久...¤That's great... I... I've been admiring {qianbei} for a long time too...

请。¤Please.
毋须留手，来罢。¤Don't hold back, just come.
{qianbei}，请。¤{qianbei}, please.
{qianbei}，恭喜。¤{qianbei}, congratulations.
抱歉，未曾听闻过此事。¤Sorry, have not heard of this.
不知道...¤I dont know...
好，我会来。¤Yes, I will come.
这天劫...当真可怖...{daoyou}，定要保重！¤This heavenly tribulation... It's horrible... {daoyou}, take care!

你能来...我很高兴...¤You can come over... I'm glad...
换装？好哦。¤Change Clothes? Sure.
换装？好。¤Change Clothes? Good.
喜欢吗？¤Do you like it?
称呼？明白了。¤Change title? Understood
{daoyou}？嗯，好。¤{daoyou}？hmmm, fine.
双修？嗯...好。¤Dual cultivation? Hmmm, Alright.
双修？好。¤Dual cultivation? Ok
还要。¤Also.
哼！你想做什么？¤Hm! What do you want to do?
来来来，今天我可要打个痛快！¤Come on, come on, I'll have a good fight today!
麻了麻了...真是了不得。¤Numb, numb... That's amazing.
就这点能耐？¤Is that all you can do?
哈哈，{qianbei}怎知我急需{item}？真是太及时了，感激不尽！¤Haha, {qianbei} How do you know that I urgently need {item}? It's so timely, thank you so much!
{qianbei}多谢啦！¤{qianbei} Thank you very much!
没想到{qianbei}如此大方，连{item}这等宝贝也舍得拿来送人，多谢多谢！¤Unexpectedly, {qianbei} was so generous, and even {item} was willing to give it away. Thank you very much!
只是{item}么...{qianbei}也未免太小气了。¤Is it just {item}? . . {qianbei} is also too stingy.
区区{item}也不值得大动干戈，拿去便是。¤A mere {item} is not worth the trouble, just take it.
哼，看在我们曾经关系不错的份上，这{item}就给你了。¤For the sake of our relationship, I'll give you this {item}.
哼，要{item}没有，要命一条，尽管来拿试试！¤If you want {item}, you don't have it, you want your life, just come and try to take it!
三十年河东，三十年河西，{qianbei}可要把这{item}收好了！¤Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, {qianbei} can put away this {item}!
为了这{item}，纵是被威胁，我也要赌上一把！¤For this {item}, even if I'm threatened, I'll take my chances!
不就{miji}，且听晚辈道来。¤Not just {miji}, let's listen to what the junior has to say.
哼，交情归交情，我可没有教你{miji}的义务。¤Hm, friendship is friendship, but I am not obliged to teach you {miji}.
这{miji}乃我{shili}立身之本，{FirstName}{qianbei}还是打消这个念头吧。¤This {miji} is the foundation of my {shili}, {First name}{qianbei} let's dispel this thought.
我最近悟道陷入瓶颈，恳请{qianbei}指点。¤I have recently fallen into a bottleneck in Enlightening, so I would like to ask {qianbei} for guidance.
哈哈哈，还请{qianbei}不吝赐教。¤Hahaha, please also {qianbei} do not hesitate to teach.
哈，多谢{qianbei}指点。¤Ha, thank you {qianbei} for your guidance.
哈，听过{qianbei}讲法才感觉到悟道原来可以这么简单。¤Ha, after hearing the {qianbei} method, I felt that Enlightening could be so simple.
抱歉，辜负{qianbei}的一番好意了。¤Sorry, I failed {qianbei}'s kindness.
可惜，可惜。¤Pity, pity.
最近闲来无事，手痒得紧，{qianbei}可有空指点指点？¤I've had nothing to do recently, and my hands are itchy. {qianbei} Can you give me some pointers if you have time?
好，我也正有此意。以后找{qianbei}指点我就方便多了哈哈哈。¤Well, I also have this intention. It will be much more convenient for me to find {qianbei} to guide me in the future. Hahaha.
慢...慢着...我从没想过这些...你能先回答我几个问题么？¤Slowly... Slowly... I never thought about this... Can you answer a few questions for me first?
咳咳...还有些怪不好意思的。就...就答应你了吧。¤Ahem... And a little bit of weird embarrassment. Just... I'll give you a yes.
我们的关系似乎还没有这么亲密吧？¤Our relationship doesn't seem to be that close yet, does it?
抱歉，不行。¤Sorry, Thats not possible.
{qianbei}可别拿我寻开心了。¤{qianbei} Don't make fun of me.
{qianbei}若是再拿我说笑，头都给你打飞。¤{qianbei} If you make fun of me again, your head will fly.
{daoyou}，什么事儿？¤{daoyou}, what is it?
哈哈哈哈，徒儿终于还是出息了。¤Hahahaha, the disciple finally got a chance.
哈哈哈哈，看来为师还够资格指点你。¤Hahahaha, it seems that being a teacher is qualified enough to guide you.
{qianbei}，别墨迹了，出手吧！¤{qianbei}, stop the ink, let's do it!
{qianbei}还是厉害，我自愧不如！¤{qianbei} is still amazing, I am ashamed!
哈哈哈哈，看来我还是能和{qianbei}较量较量！¤Hahaha, looks like I can still compete with {qianbei}!
御剑门？听都没听说过，{daoyou}打听这个做甚？¤The Royal Sword Sect? I've never even heard of it, so why would {daoyou} ask about it?
{daoyou}要飞升了？如此盛事我肯定不会错过！¤{daoyou} is going to ascend? I wouldn't miss such an event for the world!
不愧是化神强者才能引动的天地大劫，真了不得！{daoyou}加油！定要把劫云狠狠击碎！¤It's worthy of the great tribulation of heaven and earth that can only be triggered by a strong Deity Transformation. {daoyou} Come on! You must smash the tribulation cloud!
{daoyou}放心，就凭这天劫，还拦不下我！¤{daoyou} Don't worry, with this heavenly tribulation, it can't stop me!
更换装扮？好呀好呀！你等着啊！¤Change of costume? Yes, yes, yes! Wait for it!
要我换个装扮？好啊！你等会啊！¤Want me to change my costume? Sure! Wait a minute!
怎么样怎么样？我好看吗？¤How's it going? Do I look good?
称呼？但说无妨！¤Name calling? No problem!
{daoyou}？不错不错！¤{daoyou}? Not bad, not bad!
双修？我可等不及了！¤A dual cultivation? I can't wait!
双修？嘿嘿！我可等不及了！¤A dual cultivation? Hey, hey! I can't wait!
要不...再来？¤How about... again?
嘿嘿，真不错，不过...这就结束了？¤Hey, hey, that's nice, but... That's the end of it?
呵呵，还请{qianbei}手下留情。¤Hehe, please be merciful to {qianbei}.
（眼中厉色一闪）多谢{qianbei}指点。¤(A sharp color flashed in his eyes) Thank you {qianbei} for your guidance.
在下正急需{item}，就不跟{qianbei}客气了，相赠之情必不敢忘。¤I am in urgent need of {item}, so I won't be polite to {qianbei}. I dare not forget the gift.
竟是{item}！承蒙{qianbei}厚爱，那在下就却之不恭了。¤It turned out to be {item}! Thanks to the love of {qianbei}, it would be disrespectful.
这{item}价值之高，在下受之有愧。不过既然{daoyou}坚持，那在下就却之不恭了。¤The value of this {item} is so high that I am ashamed to accept it. But since {daoyou} insisted, I will not accept it.
{qianbei}真是别出心裁，只可惜这{item}在下暂时用不上。¤{qianbei} is really ingenious, but it's a pity that this {item} won't be available for the time being.
你的{item}也算得上是件宝贝，勉强能入在下的法眼。今天在下心情不错，把它交出来，在下便饶你一条性命。¤Your {item} is a treasure, and it's barely worthy of my attention. I'm in a good mood today, so hand it over and I'll spare your life.
呵呵，这{item}能被{qianbei}看上是在下的荣幸。¤Hehe, it is an honor for this {item} to be seen by {qianbei}.
{qianbei}竟会为了{item}威胁我？这就是被好友背刺的感觉么，真是令人窒息的刺痛啊。¤{qianbei} actually threatened me for {item}? Is this the feeling of being stabbed in the back by a friend? It's really a suffocating tingling.
{daoyou}真要为了这{item}对在下动手么？可要考虑好了。¤Is {daoyou} really going to do this to me for {item}? Think about it.
{qianbei}这是在在跟在下开玩笑吧？¤{qianbei} Are you kidding me?
哼，在下还说{diyu}唯在下马首是瞻呢。¤I said that {diyu} is the only one who looks up to me.
看来这{item}跟{qianbei}更有缘，在下只好双手奉上了，呵呵。¤It seems that this {item} is more destined to {qianbei}, so I have to offer it with both hands, haha.
{FirstName}{qianbei}真会为了这{item}对在下动手么？这可不太划算，{qianbei}还是三思为上。¤{First name}{qianbei} Would you really do something to me for this {item}? This is not very cost-effective, {qianbei} still think twice.
这{miji}虽颇为珍稀，但既然{FirstName}{qianbei}开口了，在下自然不会拒绝。¤Although this {miji} is quite rare, since {First name}{qianbei} has spoken, I will naturally not refuse.
这{miji}在下得来不易，怕是不能轻易传授给{FirstName}{qianbei}。¤This {miji} is not easy to get, and I am afraid that it cannot be easily passed on to {First name}{qianbei}.
在下也想将这{miji}传授于{FirstName}{qianbei}，奈何宗门之命难以违抗，见谅。¤I also want to teach this {miji} to {First name}{qianbei}, but the order of the sect is difficult to disobey, please forgive me.
听闻{qianbei}精于悟道及讲法，在下刚好遇到瓶颈，不知{qianbei}可愿指点在下一番？¤I heard that {qianbei} is good at Enlightening and speaking, but I just encountered a bottleneck in the next step. I wonder if {qianbei} would like to give me some pointers in the next step?
既然{qianbei}有意相邀，那在下就却之不恭了。¤Since {qianbei} intends to invite each other, it would be disrespectful.
{qianbei}对道的领悟，令在下只能望洋兴叹。¤{qianbei} The Earth of Tao makes me only look at the ocean and sigh.
多些{qianbei}指点，可惜在下今天不在状态，辜负{qianbei}好意了，实在是抱歉。¤Give more {qianbei} guidance, but unfortunately, I am not in a state today, and I am really sorry to disappoint {qianbei}'s kindness.
多谢{qianbei}指点，可惜在下今天不在状态，浪费{qianbei}事件了，实在是抱歉。¤Thank you {qianbei} for your guidance. Unfortunately, I am not in a state today. I am really sorry for wasting the {qianbei} incident.
听闻{qianbei}同境内战力无双，不知今日在下可有幸见识见识？¤Hearing that {qianbei} is unparalleled in combat power in the same territory, I wonder if I will be lucky enough to see it today?
在下与{qianbei}相谈甚欢，也正有以后多多联系之意。还请{qianbei}将神识信息留于在下传音符中。¤I have a great time talking with {qianbei} below, and I am also interested in contacting you more in the future. Please also {qianbei} leave the consciousness inArray in the uploaded note.
抱歉，尽管我对你亦有好感，但综合各方面来看，你我并不适合结为道侣。¤Sorry, although I also have a good feeling about you, but from all aspects, you and I are not suitable to be a dao couple.
哈哈哈，算你不走运，竟然遇到了我。¤Hahaha, you are not lucky, you actually met me.
{qianbei}，还望手下留情。¤{qianbei}, I hope to show mercy.
嘶...这天劫威能竟恐怖如斯？¤Hiss... How can this heavenly tribulation be so terrifying?
以{daoyou}的修为，渡过这天劫应该不是什么难事吧？¤With {daoyou}'s cultivation level, it shouldn't be difficult to cross this heavenly tribulation, right?
这天劫威能，当真有如此恐怖么...¤Is the power of this heavenly tribulation really so terrifying...
更换装扮？好呀，你想要什么样子的？¤Change of costume? Sure, what do you want?
感觉怎么样？喜欢吗？¤How does it feel? Do you like it?
双修？这可是你说的，别后悔啊~¤Dual cultivation? That's what you said, don't regret it~
{daoyou}怎么这么厉害...不过还真是收益颇丰呢~¤{daoyou} How did it get so good... But it's really rewarding!
{daoyou}怎么这么厉害...不过还真是收益颇丰呢。¤{daoyou} How did it get so good... It's really rewarding though.
难得{qianbei}有此兴致，请指教！¤It's rare for {qianbei} to have this interest, please advise!
没想到{daoyou}竟是如此心性贪婪之人，我算是看走眼了。¤I didn't expect {daoyou} to be such a greedy-minded person, I kind of misread my eyes.
请{qianbei}谅解，这{miji}我不能传授于你。¤Please {qianbei} forgive me, I cannot impart this {miji} to you.
细细想来，我似乎没有什么理由拒绝你，不是么。¤When I think about it, I don't seem to have any reason to refuse you, do I?
多谢{daoyou}相邀，能观摩您渡劫飞升，定是大有收获。{daoyou}...保重！¤Thank you {daoyou} for inviting me, it must have been very rewarding to observe your ascension. {daoyou}... Take care!
嘿嘿，多谢{daoyou}，以您的修为，真是令我受益颇多。¤Hey, thanks a lot {daoyou}, with your training, it really benefited me a lot.
哈哈，还请{qianbei}手下留情啊。¤Haha, please be merciful to {qianbei}.
果然还是{qianbei}技高一筹啊，在下心服口服。¤Sure enough, {qianbei} is still highly skilled, and he is convinced.
多谢{qianbei}留我颜面了。¤Thank you {qianbei} for keeping my face.
哈哈，既是{qianbei}相赠，我就不客气啦！¤Haha, as a gift from {qianbei}, I'm welcome!
毋需挂心。¤Don't worry about it.
好，以后游历中有什么见闻也方便与{daoyou}分享。¤I'll be happy to share with {daoyou} what I see in my future travels.
我一直以为我们只是普通朋友的关系...¤I always thought we were just friends...
抱歉，尽管我们如此亲密，但我们真的只是朋友...对不起...我们还是做朋友吧。¤I'm sorry, even though we're so close, we're really just friends... I'm sorry... Let's just be friends.
{qianbei}，尽管出手吧。¤{qianbei}, go ahead.
千年修为，只为今朝。{daoyou},保重！¤Thousands of years of cultivation, just for this day. {daoyou}, take care!
哼，再给我些时日结果未必如此。¤I don't think that's what I'll get if I have more time.
呵，正是我需要的{item}，那我就收下了。¤I'll take it, then.
哈哈哈，这天地间能懂我的唯有{FirstName}{qianbei}而已！¤Hahaha, the only one who can understand me in this world is {First name}{qianbei}!
这{item}品味虽不咋样，倒也算得上一件宝贝，我就收下了。¤This {item} is not in good taste, but it is a treasure, so I'll take it.
呵，拿走吧。修仙艰难，{qianbei}可要当心别碰着什么意外，就这么陨落了。¤Hehe, take it away. Xiuxian is difficult, {qianbei}, but be careful not to encounter any accidents and just fall.
哼，所为真是令人不耻。¤What a disgraceful thing to do.
呵，会点微末之技就想强抢我的{item}？回去好好估一下自己的斤两吧。¤You want to rob me {item} by force because you know a little skill? Go back and assess your own weight.
呵，拿走吧。修仙艰难，{qianbei}可要当心天劫，别轻易陨落了。¤Hehe, take it away. Cultivating immortals is difficult, {qianbei} But beware of tribulation, don't fall easily.
哼，我倒是要试试，若是不交出{item}，{qianbei}要把我怎样！¤Huh, I have to try, if I don't hand over {item}, what will {qianbei} do to me!
哼，不就是{miji}，拿去拿去。¤Hmph, it's just {miji}, take it and take it.
不错，跟{qianbei}论道也还算有点收获。¤Yes, it is also a bit rewarding to discuss with {qianbei}.
啧，{qianbei}真是在浪费我时间。¤Tsk, {qianbei} is really wasting my time.
啧，就这？真是误人子弟。¤Tsk, that's it? What a mistake.
好，正有此意，只有我与{qianbei}才是这一世的天之骄子，往后多联系哈哈哈。¤Well, with this intention, only {qianbei} and I are the proud sons of heaven in this life. Let's contact hahaha more in the future.
好吧...就答应你了。别搞错了，我才不会对你有意思，只是一时想不到怎么拒绝你而已。¤Well... I'll give you a yes. Don't get me wrong, I'm not interested in you, I just can't think of a way to say no to you.
我们有这么熟么？¤Do we know each other that well?
抱歉，虽然我真的很喜欢和你在一起的时光，但...但...不可以。¤I'm sorry, but as much as I really enjoyed my time with you... But... No way.
{qianbei}，你不过是修为高一些罢了，我可不怕你。¤{qianbei}, you are just a little higher in cultivation, I am not afraid of you.
好，我一定来。¤Yes, I will definitely come.
别误会...我可没有被这天劫吓到...{daoyou}，你、你...一定要成功啊！¤Don't get me wrong... I'm not intimidated by this heavenly disaster... {daoyou}, you, you... Make sure you succeed!
这种事情，真是没意思得很...过会继续如何？¤This kind of thing is so pointless... How about continuing after the meeting?
{qianbei}是要指点我吗？我不会给你钱的。¤{qianbei} Are you going to point me out? I won't give you money.
哎哎，{qianbei}下手真重，这都要赔我丹药钱了。¤Hey, {qianbei} is so heavy, it will cost me money for pill.
嘿嘿，{qianbei}要不要我教你几招啊，不过不是免费的哦。¤Hehe, {qianbei} Do you want me to teach you a few tricks, but it's not free.
没想到这么轻易就得到了这{item}。真是踏破铁鞋无觅处啊，嘿嘿。¤I didn't expect to get this {item} so easily. Really stepped through the iron shoes, ah, hehehe.
{item}！{qianbei}与我交情如此之好，我就不作推辞了，嘿嘿。¤{item}！ {qianbei} If you have such a good relationship with me, I won't refuse, Hehe.
嘶...这{item}可是相当值钱的宝贝，多谢{qianbei}！¤Hiss. . . This {item} is quite valuable, thank you {qianbei}!
森蛛再小也是肉，不错不错。¤Sam spiders are still meat even if they are small, not bad not bad.
真是流年不利，今天就不该出门，哎，没...没什么！我是说这{item}就是{qianbei}才配拥有！¤It's really bad luck in the fleeting years, I shouldn't go out today, hey, no. . . Nothing! I mean this {item} is only worthy of {qianbei}!
我虽心性贪婪倒还顾及朋友情谊，没想到{qianbei}竟贪婪到如此境地。¤Although I am greedy by nature, I still take into account the friendship of friends, but I didn't expect {qianbei} to be so greedy.
{item}此等无价之宝，纵是威胁，我又怎会相让！¤I'm not sure how I could have given up such a priceless treasure, even if it was a threat!
哎，看来今天只能忍痛割肉了，赶紧拿走。¤I'll have to cut my losses today, so I'll take it.
{item}此等无价之宝，纵是威胁，我又怎会轻易相让！¤I will not give up such a priceless treasure, even if it is a threat!
以{qianbei}与我的交情，区区{miji}自不在话下。¤With the friendship between {qianbei} and me, a mere {miji} is a cinch.
嘿嘿，{qianbei}想学{miji}的话，是不是该意思意思。¤Hehe, if {qianbei} wants to learn {miji}, should it mean something?
{FirstName}{qianbei}，{miji}乃我派立身之本，怕是不能轻易教你。¤{First name}{qianbei}, {miji} is the foundation of my school, I'm afraid I can't teach you easily.
还有这等好事，{qianbei}我们这就开始吧！¤There are still such good things, {qianbei} let's start now!
多谢{qianbei}指点，有空再来，嘿嘿。¤Thank you {qianbei} for your guidance, come back when you have time, Hehe.
唉，没啥收获还搭上去不少时间，亏了亏了。¤I didn't get much out of it, and I lost a lot of time.
唉，看来只能想办法找个靠谱的{qianbei}指导我一下了。¤Alas, it seems that I can only find a way to find a reliable {qianbei} to guide me.
我最近新得一件法宝，{qianbei}可有空陪我磨合一番？¤I recently acquired a new magic weapon. {qianbei} Can you have time to run in with me?
太好了，我也正有此意。{qianbei}若是有好事，别忘了带我一个嘿嘿。¤Great, I also have this intention. {qianbei}If there is a good thing, don't forget to bring me a Hehe.
{qianbei}的财...哦不，性格深得我心，很高兴能与{qianbei}结缘。¤{qianbei}'s wealth. . . Oh no, my personality is deeply rooted in my heart, and I am very happy to be associated with {qianbei}.
还是先让我看到你的“诚意”吧！¤Let me see your 'sincerity' first!
可惜，我实在看不出与{daoyou}结缘对我有什么好处。即便真有的话，恐怕也是弊大于利。¤Unfortunately, I don't see what good it would do for me to be associated with {daoyou}. Even if it does, I'm afraid it will do more harm than good.
看在{qianbei}送礼颇丰的份上，此次就当无事发生。¤For the sake of {qianbei}'s generous gifts, nothing happened this time.
{daoyou}，可是有好东西要给我？¤{daoyou}, but there's something good for me?
{qianbei}可要手下留情啊。¤{qianbei} You have to be merciful.
哈哈哈，运气真好，居然遇到一个这么弱的对手。¤Hahaha, lucky to meet such a weak opponent.
嘶...{daoyou}突然打听这个，莫非是得到了什么秘宝传闻？¤Hiss... {daoyou}Suddenly inquiring about this, could it be that you got some secret treasure rumor?
嘶...{daoyou}是找到了什么古代遗迹了么？快与我说说！¤Hiss... Did {daoyou} find any ancient ruins? Tell me about it!
这渡劫可是九死一生，{daoyou}可有什么东西需要我代为保管的么？¤This is tribulation of nine deaths, {daoyou} is there anything I need to keep for you?
如果可以的话，我才不想飞升...倒是不如留在这下界来的逍遥快活。¤I wouldn't want to ascend if I could... I'd rather stay in the lower realms and be happy.
怎么~想让我更换一下装扮吗？好~都依你~不过你要多给我买些宝贝哦~¤What, you want me to change my costume? Okay, I'll do whatever you want, but you have to buy me some more babies.
怎么？想让我更换一下装扮？好，好，好~¤What? Want me to change my costume? Yes, yes, yes~
怎么样？喜欢吗？¤How was it? Do you like it?
{daoyou}？听起来不错，还有没有更不错的？¤{daoyou}? Sounds good, is there anything better?
双修？桀桀，我可等候多时喽~¤Dual cultivation? I've been waiting for you!
好、好棒...不过瘾~{daoyou}，再来一会吧~¤Good, good... Not too much~{daoyou}, let's have some more~
不过瘾~{daoyou}，再来一会吧！¤Not too much fun~ {daoyou}, just a little longer!
不错，不错。¤Not bad, not bad.
是{item}？我正急需此物，真是解了燃眉之急了！¤Is it {item}? I was in desperate need of this item, what a relief!
此物我恰好需要，多谢{qianbei}赠礼！¤I just need this thing, thank you {qianbei} for your gift!
哈哈哈，像{item}这等宝贝，本就应该属于我才对。¤Hahahaha, a treasure like {item} should have belonged to me.
哼，区区{item}...¤I don't know, just {item}...
以{qianbei}与我的关系，区区{miji}，好说好说。¤The relationship between {qianbei} and me is as simple as {miji}, which is easy to say.
貌似教你{miji}于我没有好处。¤It seems that teaching you {miji} would not benefit me.
我倒是想教你，但这{miji}乃我{shili}不传之秘。¤I would like to teach you, but this {miji} is a secret that I {shili} do not pass on.
和{qianbei}结缘于我亦有好处，可以。¤It is also good for me to be associated with {qianbei}, yes.
{qianbei}莫非是认为戏弄我很有意思？¤{qianbei} Do you think it's interesting to tease me?
{qianbei}，来吧。¤{qianbei}, come on.
哈哈，不愧是我！¤Haha, as expected of me!
若是我的话，定要亲手击溃这劫云！¤If it were up to me, I would smash this Tribulation with my own hands!
哈哈哈，今日便是我飞升上界之日，若是这天要拦我，我便逆天！¤Hahahaha, today is the day I will ascend to the upper realms. If the heavens want to stop me, I will rebel against the heavens!
怎么？想换个装扮？¤What? Want to change your look?
称呼？随便你吧。¤Name calling? Whatever you want.
{daoyou}？好，依你。¤{daoyou}? Yes, you do.
双修？嘿嘿，瞧我的~¤Dual cultivation? Ey, Ey, look at me~
{daoyou}的修为深厚，我、我顶不住了。¤{daoyou}'s cultivation is so deep that I, I can't top it.
（对方面色冷淡）谢{qianbei}指点。¤(The other party's expression is cold) Thank {qianbei} for his guidance.
不。¤No.
很好，正合我意。¤Very good, exactly what I want.
（对方摆开架势示意你）...¤（The opponent sets up a stance to show you）...
哈哈哈，此物我正好需要！¤Hahahaha, this is just what I need!
好吧，谢谢了。¤Well, thanks a lot.
哼，看在我们曾经关系不错的份上，这{item}就给{qianbei}了。¤Huh, for the sake of our good relationship, this {item} will be given to {qianbei}.
哈，听过{qianbei}讲法才感觉到悟道原来可以这么简单，多谢！¤Ha, I only felt that Enlightening can be so simple after listening to {qianbei}, thank you!
真是浪费我时间。¤What a waste of my time.
就不该找人论道，真是浪费时间。¤It's a waste of time.
{qianbei}，别墨迹了，出手吧。¤{qianbei}, stop the ink, let's do it.
麻了，{qianbei}还是厉害。¤It's numb, but {qianbei} is still amazing.
哈哈哈哈，看来对上{qianbei}，我也算有一战之力！¤Hahaha, it seems that against {qianbei}, I can count as a battle force!
再来...再来！¤Again... Again!
{daoyou}此举何意？¤What is the point of {daoyou} doing this?
{daoyou}如此行径，就别怪在下不留情面了！¤{daoyou}I don't blame me for being unforgiving!
{daoyou}，小心了。¤{daoyou}, be careful.
多谢{daoyou}指点。¤Thank you {daoyou} for pointing it out.
{daoyou}，你没事吧？¤Are you all right, {daoyou}?
我恰好就急需这{item}，真是多谢{daoyou}了！¤I needed this {item} in a hurry, so thank you {daoyou} for that!
此物正是我急需，愧领了。¤It's exactly what I needed and I'm sorry to receive it.
这{item}我虽然暂时用不上，却也是相当贵重的礼物，多谢{daoyou}了。¤I don't need this {item} for a while, but it is a very valuable gift, thank you {daoyou}.
此物虽非我急需，但还是谢谢了。¤It is not something I need urgently, but thank you anyway.
这...{daoyou}为何要送我这{item}？¤This... Why did {daoyou} give me this {item}?
有..有话好说，这{item}就让你就拿去罢。¤There is... I'll let you have the {item} if you want to.
嗯，虽然出人意料倒也能理解吧，这{item}就让{daoyou}拿去罢。¤Well, I guess it's understandable that it's unexpected, so I'll let {daoyou} have it.
原来是{friendid}{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，那这{item}便交给{daoyou}。¤It turned out to be {specrel} of {friendid}{qianbei}, then this {item} will be handed over to {Daoyou}.
{friendid}{qianbei}...怎么是这个麻烦人物...快拿去。¤{friendid}{qianbei}. . . How is this troublesome person. . . Take it quickly.
哼，{daoyou}若有本事，就自己来拿试试！¤If {daoyou} can do it, try to get it yourself!
{friendid}{qianbei}可是{friendlevel}强者，才不会为了区区{item}来{diyu}对付我。¤{friendid}{qianbei}is a strong {friendlevel}, so he won't come to {diyu} to deal with me for a mere {item}.
你是{friendid}{qianbei}的{SpecRel}又怎样？{qianbei}才不会在这方面任你为所欲为！¤What if you are {SpecRel} of {friendid}{qianbei}? {qianbei} will not let you do whatever you want in this regard!
{friendid}？一个{friendlevel}修士就是你的倚仗？¤{friendid}? A {friendlevel} Cultivator is what you rely on?
啊？竟然是和我同名的{friendlevel}修士么？嗯？{daoyou}是在想借此威胁我？哦哦，{size=29}只{/size}{size=28}是{/size}{size=27}在{/size}{size=26}开{/size}{size=25}玩{/size}{size=24}笑{/size}{size=23}啊{/size}，{size=22}哈{/size}{size=20}哈{/size}{size=18}哈{/size}{size=20}。{/size}¤Ah? Is it a {friendlevel} Cultivator with the same name as me? Huh? Is {daoyou} trying to threaten me with this? Oh oh, {size=29}Just {/size}{size=28}kidding {/size}{size=27}with {/size}{size=26}you {/size}{size=25}Aha {/size}{size=24}ha{/size},{size=22}ha{/size}{size=20}ha{/size}{size=18}ha{/size}{size=20}.{/size}
{item}可是我的珍宝！不会这么简单就交出来的！¤{item} is my treasure! It won't be handed over so easily!
{miji}？{FirstName}{daoyou}拿去吧。¤{miji}? {FirstName}{daoyou}Take it.
{FirstName}{daoyou}，你我之间关系虽好，但这{miji}我也不能白白教你啊。¤{FirstName}{daoyou}, although we have a good relationship, I can't teach you this {miji} for nothing.
唉，{FirstName}{daoyou}有所不知，这{miji}乃是我{shili}的不传之秘，我可无权擅自传授。¤I don't know, {FirstName}{daoyou}, this {miji} is my {shili} secret and I don't have the right to pass it on without permission.
我最近在悟道时遇到了一些瓶颈，枯坐闭关已然无用，{daoyou}可愿论道探讨一番？¤I have recently encountered some bottlenecks in my enlightenment, and sitting in seclusion is no longer useful, so would {daoyou} like to discuss it?
还请{daoyou}不吝赐教。¤I would be grateful if {daoyou} would be so kind as to give me some advice.
多谢{daoyou}指点，感激不尽。¤I am grateful for {daoyou}'s guidance.
此次与{daoyou}相谈甚欢，只可惜...¤I've had a great time talking to {daoyou}, but unfortunately...
多谢{daoyou}相助，只可惜...¤Thank you {daoyou} for your help, it's just a pity...
我最近正在修炼一门神通，可否请{daoyou}指点一二？¤I am recently training a divine ability, could I ask {daoyou} to give me some pointers?
哼，我和你之间没有什么可说的。¤Hm, there's nothing between me and you.
太好了，我也正有此意。日后若有要事，{daoyou}便可通过这传音符和我联系了。¤Great, that's exactly what I want to do. If there is something important in the future, {daoyou} will be able to contact me through this sound transmission talisman.
这...{daoyou}是认真的么？¤Is this... Is {daoyou} serious?
抱歉，我并不想与你交易。¤Sorry, I don't want to trade with you.
原来是{FirstName}{daoyou}。既然是{daoyou}在此处采集，那我便不打搅了...¤So it was {FirstName}{daoyou}. Since {daoyou} is here to collect, I won't bother...
原来是{daoyou}...你也对我这条灵脉感兴趣么？¤So it's {daoyou}... Are you also interested in this spirit vein of mine?
{daoyou}，此处灵脉是我先抢得的，还请移步他处。¤{daoyou}, I grabbed the spirit vein here first, so please move elsewhere.
多谢{daoyou}，你真厉害~真是受益匪浅~¤Thanks {daoyou}, you're great~ it's really beneficial~
多谢{daoyou}，你可真厉害，真是受益匪浅哪。¤Thanks {daoyou}, you're great, it's been very beneficial.
{daoyou}何故行此见不得人的勾当？¤Why is {daoyou} doing this unseemly thing?
请{daoyou}指点。¤Please enlighten {daoyou}.
{daoyou}出手利落，法随心动，我还需要多多磨练啊。¤{daoyou}The strike is sharp, the law moves with the heart, I still need to hone more ah.
侥幸得胜，多谢{daoyou}留手。¤I was lucky to win, thank you {daoyou} for your help.
这{item}我虽然用不上，但还是多谢{daoyou}的好意了。¤I won't be able to use this {item}, but thank you {daoyou} for your kindness.
你不必如此，不过是{item}，你若需要，拿去便是。¤You don't have to do that, it's just {item}, if you need it, just take it.
久仰{friendid}{qianbei}大名，既然{FirstName}{daoyou}是{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，这{item}拿去便是，不用客气。¤I have long admired the name of {friendid}{qianbei}. Since {First name}{Daoyou} is {SpecRel} of {qianbei}, just take this {item}. You are welcome.
{friendid}{qianbei}...还是不要被他盯上为好...这{item}便送给{daoyou}了。¤{friendid}{qianbei}. . . It's better not to be targeted by him. . . This {item} was given to {Daoyou}.
此等苍白无力地威胁，别想让我交出这无价的{item}。¤You can't make me give up this priceless {item} with such a pale threat.
怎么，{daoyou}是把我当软柿子了？¤What, does {daoyou} think I'm a soft touch?
{friendid}{qianbei}之名我自是不敢冒犯，只是这{diyu}与{qianbei}之势力所在相差甚远，你莫不是拿{qianbei}之名欺我？¤I dare not offend the name of {friendid}{qianbei}, but this {diyu} is far from the power of {qianbei}. Could you deceive me with the name of {qianbei}?
{friendid}{qianbei}乃正道砥柱，岂会因此对同源晚辈出手。¤{friendid}{qianbei}is the pillar of the right path, how could it be that he would strike the younger generation of the same origin.
{friendid}不过{friendid}修士而已，用他威胁我怕是没什么意义。¤The {friendid} is just a {friendid} Cultivator, there is no point in using him to threaten me.
{daoyou}若是空闲，不如一同论道，莫要做这些无聊之事。¤{daoyou}If you are free, why don't you discuss the path together, don't do these boring things.
虽不至于为了这{item}舍命相护，但也别想让我轻易交出！¤It is not so much that I would lay down my life to protect him for this {item}, but don't expect me to hand it over so easily either!
这{miji}虽然贵重，但相较于{FirstName}{daoyou}与我的感情还是不值一提。¤This {miji} may be valuable, but it is still nothing compared to the bond {FirstName}{daoyou} has with me.
请{daoyou}谅解，这{miji}乃我{shili}不传之秘，恕我无权外传。¤Please {daoyou} understand that this {miji} is a secret that I {shili} do not pass on, so I am sorry that I have no right to pass it on.
我最近修练时偶遇瓶颈，几经枯坐后仍无收获，{daoyou}要是有空，可否与在下探讨一番，交流悟道之心得。¤I have recently encountered a bottleneck in my training, and I have been sitting down for a few days without any luck.
得见{daoyou}之道，如观众妙之门。¤If you have the time, can you share with me your experience of enlightenment?
我枯坐十年的领悟，不如{daoyou}片刻点拨啊。¤My ten years of sitting here is not as good as a few moments of {daoyou}'s enlightenment.
大道难求，论道没有收获不过是修仙路上的寻常事而已，{daoyou}不必气馁。¤The great path is hard to find, and it is just a common thing on the path to immortality to not gain anything from discussing the path.
无妨，无妨，我再尝试下其他方法吧。¤I'll try another method.
最近要出门历练，自觉战斗经验不足，{daoyou}可有空切磋切磋？¤I have to go out for training recently and I feel that I don't have enough experience in combat, can {daoyou} have time for a sparring session?
好，若是有要事，除闭关之外如无意外我会随时回复{daoyou}的。¤I'll get back to {daoyou} if there's something important, other than a retreat, if there's nothing unexpected.
我对{daoyou}也爱慕已久，但挑选道侣毕竟是大事，在此之前我还有几个问题想要问{daoyou}。¤I've been in love with {daoyou} for a long time, but choosing a partner is a big deal after all, so I have a few questions for {daoyou} before I do.
细细想来，我似乎没有什么理由拒绝你...那么,{daoyou}，以后请多关照哦。¤When I think about it, I don't seem to have any reason to refuse you... So, {daoyou}, please take care of me in the future.
抱歉，可惜，落花有意随流水，流水无心恋落花...此事我会当没发生过的，也请你，忘了吧。¤I'm sorry, but it's a pity that a falling flower has the intention to follow the flowing water, but the flowing water has no intention to love the falling flower... I will pretend that this never happened, and please, forget it.
{daoyou}是认真的么？¤Is {daoyou} serious?
{daoyou}还是不要开这种玩笑比较好。¤The {daoyou} is better not to make such jokes.
初次见面，请{daoyou}指点。¤When we meet for the first time, please {Daoyou} for guidance.
{daoyou}道法高明，在下佩服。¤{Daoyou} The Dao method is clever, I admire it.
多谢{daoyou}，以你的修为，真是令我受益颇多。¤Thanks {daoyou}, with your training, it has really benefited me a lot.
啊？发生了甚么事？¤What? What's going on?
哦？{daoyou}有兴致，那就请{daoyou}指教了。¤Oh? If {daoyou} is interested, then I'll ask {daoyou} for advice.
不愧是{FirstName}{daoyou}，哈哈哈，心服口服啊。¤I'm very impressed with {FirstName}{daoyou}, hahaha.
{daoyou}此举真如干天落慈雨，解我心头大患，多谢！¤I'm very impressed with {daoyou}'s move, it's like rain falling from the dry sky, it's a great relief for me.
哈哈哈，{daoyou}多谢了。¤Hahahaha, {daoyou} thanks a lot.
送给我的？这可是难得一见的{item}。谢过{daoyou}！¤For me? This is a rare {item}. Thank you {daoyou}!
这{item}虽然看着普通，不过既然是{daoyou}送的，一定非同寻常！¤This {item} may look ordinary, but since it's from {daoyou}, it must be extraordinary!
这{item}不过身外之物，便交给你吧。¤This {item} is a mere extraneous thing, so I'll give it to you.
本以为{daoyou}是我知音，原来不过是条势利的饿狼，呵。¤I thought {daoyou} was my soulmate, but it turns out he's just a snobbish, hungry wolf.
名利纠缠，物欲同生，凡俗如此，仙修亦不过如此。呵，也罢也罢，这{item}就送你了。¤The world is like this, and so is the immortal Cultivator. I'll give you this {item}.
真是麻烦，拿去吧。¤What a nuisance, take it.
威胁于我可是没什么作用的，{daoyou}还是打消这个念头吧。¤I don't think I'll get much use out of threatening you, {daoyou} so don't even think about it.
这{diyu}可非{friendid}{qianbei}的势力范围，何惧之有？¤This {diyu} is not the sphere of influence of {friendid}{qianbei}, why are you afraid of it?
{friendid}{qianbei}可不像我完全不在乎自己的名声，若是听闻{daoyou}行径，恐怕是会，哈哈哈。¤{friendid}{qianbei}It's not like I don't care about my reputation at all. If I hear about {Daoyou}'s behavior, I'm afraid I will, hahaha.
名声如烟，转瞬即逝。至于{friendid}，更是对我没有任何威胁。¤Fame is like smoke, it's gone in a flash. As for {friendid}, it's even less of a threat to me.
哈哈哈，{daoyou}这个玩笑可算不上高明。¤I'm not sure that {daoyou} is a very good joke.
死生有命，修短素定，非尔威胁所能损益，这{item}我不会轻易交出的。¤The {item} will not be handed over by me easily.
此间有山间清风，天上明月与壶中美酒，{FirstName}{daoyou}何必执着于{miji}呢？¤This {item} I will not give up so easily. I have the breeze of the mountains, the moon in the sky and the wine in the jug, {FirstName}{daoyou}why cling to {miji}?
怀璧于身不外露，立身之本怎轻传，{daoyou}还是学其他的吧。¤I'm not sure how I can pass on the truth that I'm a good person, but {daoyou} should learn something else.
现下无事，{daoyou}可愿与我探讨一番这天地大道？¤Now that I have nothing to do, would {daoyou} like to discuss with me the great path of heaven and earth?
左右无事，便与{daoyou}交流一番吧。¤I have nothing to do, so let's talk to {daoyou}.
既闻{daoyou}之道，夕死可矣。¤If I hear about {daoyou}'s way, I can die at night.
与{daoyou}论道如饮醍醐，使我茅塞顿开。¤I am so enlightened by discussing with {daoyou}.
{daoyou}毋需挂心，有机会再一起论道吧。¤Don't worry about {daoyou}, let's talk about it again when we have the chance.
只是探讨而已，{daoyou}不用在意。¤It's just a discussion, {daoyou} don't mind.
左右无事，{daoyou}可愿交流交流战斗经验聊以消遣？¤If you have nothing else to do, would {daoyou} like to share your fighting experience for fun?
什么？{daoyou}是认真的么？¤What? Is {daoyou} serious?
哈哈哈，{daoyou}邀约，在下怎敢拒绝。¤I don't know how I could refuse {daoyou}'s invitation.
哈哈哈，早就想与{daoyou}放开手脚大战一场了！¤Hahaha, I have long wanted to start a war with {Daoyou}!
哈哈，徒儿终于还是出息了。¤Haha, the disciple is finally out.
哈哈，看来为师还够资格指点你。¤Haha, it seems that being a teacher is qualified enough to guide you.
哈哈哈，不愧是{daoyou}，我心服口服！¤Hahaha, as expected of {Daoyou}, I am convinced!
哈哈哈，看来还是我更胜一筹！¤Hahaha, it seems that I am better than that!
真过瘾，{daoyou}修为实数高深，真是受益匪浅哪。¤It was very enjoyable, and the {daoyou} training was really profound, so I really benefited from it.
哈哈哈，雕虫小技，你以为我发现不了么？¤You think I won't find out?
噢？你看起来很自信的样子。¤Oh? You look very confident.
疼疼疼！{daoyou}快停手，我不和你打了！¤Ouch, ouch, ouch! {daoyou} Stop it, I won't fight you!
{daoyou}怎知我正在寻找此物？¤How did {daoyou} know I was looking for this?
哇，竟然是{item}！这可是相当贵重的礼物，多谢{daoyou}！¤Wow, it's {item}! That's a very valuable gift, thank you {daoyou}!
只是{item}么...不过这也是{daoyou}你的一片心意嘛。¤It's just {item}... But it's a token of {daoyou}'s appreciation.
哼，狐假虎威的家伙，拿去拿去。¤Here, take it, you fox, take it.
{friendid}{qianbei}...那个老家伙，真是丢...哎哎哎，我可没说什么多余的话，拿了东西快走。¤{friendid}{qianbei}. . . That old guy is really embarrassing. . . Hey, hey, I didn't say anything superfluous, I took my things and left.
巧取不成，{daoyou}还想强夺试试？¤If you can't take it by trickery, how can you try to take it by force?
别打{item}的主意了，我才不信{friendid}{qianbei}会为了这个花时间赶到{diyu}来惩治我这晚辈，啊哈哈哈。¤Don't make the idea of {item}, I don't believe that {friendid}{qianbei} will take the time to rush to {diyu} to punish my junior for this, ahhaha.
哈哈哈，你竟然用{friendid}{qianbei}压我。谁不知道{qianbei}从不容忍此等行为。¤Hahaha, you actually used {friendid}{qianbei} to pressure me. Who doesn't know that {qianbei} will never tolerate such behavior.
{friendlevel}强者{friendid}？哈哈哈，{daoyou}是在给我讲笑话么？¤{friendlevel} strong {friendid}? Hahahaha, is {daoyou} telling me a joke?
你居然为了{item}威...唉？等等，这不就是我么，原来{FirstName}{daoyou}在跟我开玩笑啊哈哈。¤You actually for {item} wi... Ugh? Wait, isn't that me, so {FirstName}{daoyou} is joking with me haha.
这{item}虽不是我心爱之物，但也是价值不菲，可别想轻易从我这拿走！¤This {item} is not my favorite, but it's still worth a lot, so don't take it away from me so easily!
{FirstName}{daoyou}，白嫖可不好啊哈哈哈。¤{FirstName}{daoyou}, it's not good to whoring around for nothing hahaha.
哈，正想找个人探讨悟道心得就碰到了{daoyou}，不知可有时间与我交流一番？¤I was looking for someone to discuss my enlightenment with and I came across {daoyou}, do you have time to talk to me?
哈哈，正有此意，还请{FirstName}{daoyou}指点。¤I'd like to have some time to talk to you, but I'd like to ask {FirstName}{daoyou} for guidance.
看来我与{daoyou}对悟道的差距，有亿点点多哈哈哈。¤It seems that the gap between me and {daoyou} on enlightenment is a billion points more hahaha.
不愧是{FirstName}{daoyou}，轻轻松松就解决了我的困惑哈哈哈。¤Not bad for {FirstName}{daoyou}, solving my confusion with ease hahaha.
咦？我是不是拖{daoyou}后腿了？¤Huh? Am I holding {daoyou} back?
又失败了，枯燥的论道果然不适合我啊哈哈哈。¤Failed again, boring arguments really don't suit me hahaha.
哈，{daoyou}好久不见，可愿切磋一番增进下感情？¤I don't know if I've seen {daoyou} in a while, but would you like to spar?
太好了，我也正有此意，{daoyou}以后若有要事随时联系。除非有什么意外，不然我都会随时回复的，别紧张，我说的是闭关啦，我才没那么容易陨落哈哈哈。¤That's great, that's what I'd like to do, {daoyou} feel free to get in touch if you need anything in the future. I'll be ready to reply unless there's something unexpected, don't be nervous, I'm talking about a retreat, I don't fall that easily hahaha.
哈哈，{daoyou}不是在和我开玩笑吧？¤I'm not sure if {daoyou} is joking with me, right?
{daoyou}，你看起来很自信的样子~¤{Daoyou}, you look very confident~
看来这次是我赢啦！¤Looks like I won this time!
称呼？你不会要我叫你什么奇怪的东西吧。¤How can i adress you? You don't want me to call you anything weird.
双修？嘻嘻，我可等候多时喽~¤Dual Cultivate? Heehee, I've been waiting for this~
怎么？¤What?
哼，自寻死路！¤What?
有多少能耐就都拿出来吧。¤Let's bring out all the power we have.
哼，大意了而已。¤I'm just careless.
行气不畅，术法不精。哼，回去再练练吧。¤I'm just careless. I can't move my qi properly, and I'm not good at the art. Hmph, go back and practise again.
居...居然是{item}！我正需...咳咳...为了不让{daoyou}尴尬，我就大发慈悲的收下吧！¤I can't believe... I can't believe it's {item}! I was in need of... Ahem... So as not to embarrass {daoyou}, I'll be merciful and take it!
居然是{item}。别...别搞错了！我...我才不会喜欢这种{item}！¤I can't believe it's {item}. Don't... Don't get it wrong! I... I'm not going to like this {item}!
虽然{daoyou}送的礼物不合我心意，但也不必过于在意。毕竟我的品味不是谁都能领会的。¤Although the gift from {daoyou} is not to my liking, there is no need to be overly concerned. After all, my taste is not something that anyone can appreciate.
{item}？{daoyou}莫不是在拿我寻开心？¤{item}? Is {daoyou} not making fun of me?
哼，{daoyou}所为真是令人不耻。¤It's a shame what {daoyou} is doing.
{friendid}{qianbei}怎么结识了你这种人。也罢，这{item}就当被我弄丢了吧。¤{friendid}{qianbei}How did I meet someone like you. Anyway, this {item} should be regarded as lost by me.
又是要拿去孝敬{friendid}{qianbei}的？哼，拿去吧。¤Are you going to honor {friendid}{qianbei} with filial piety again? Huh, take it.
哼，连我都敢威胁？倒要看看你到底有几分本事！¤How dare you threaten me? I'll see how good you really are!
哈哈，天下之大，{friendid}{qianbei}要找到我谈何容易！又怎么会怕你这威胁？¤Haha, the world is so big, {friendid}{qianbei} it's not easy to find me! How can I be afraid of your threat?
哼，竟妄图用{friendid}{qianbei}的名头骗取我的{item}，真是无知者胆大。¤Huh, it's really courageous of the ignorant to try to defraud my {item} with the name {friendid}{qianbei}.
哼，你是以为用这种拙劣的玩笑就能引起我的注意么？¤You think you can get my attention with a poor joke like that?
这{item}可非凡物，{daoyou}可要保管好了，别让其他下三滥的修士抢了去。¤This {item} is an extraordinary object, {daoyou} must keep it safe and not let other lowly Cultivator steal it.
如此威胁也想让我轻易交出{item}？{daoyou}可是太高估自己的实力了。¤You want me to hand over {item} so easily even with such a threat? {daoyou} is overestimating his own strength.
哼，不就是{miji}，我才不会心疼呢。¤Hmph, it's just {miji}, I'm not going to be heartbroken.
我最近在悟道时遇到一些瓶颈，{daoyou}可有时间探讨一番？若是没空就算了，我自己也可以解决。¤I have recently encountered some bottlenecks in my enlightenment, does {daoyou} have time to discuss it? If I don't have time, forget it, I can solve it myself.
刚好闲得无聊，便陪{daoyou}消磨一番吧。¤I'm just bored, so I'll spend some time with {daoyou}.
各取所需而已，{daoyou}不用在意。¤I'm just trying to get what I want, so don't worry about it.
谢...谢谢{FirstName}{daoyou}为我解惑。¤Thank you... Thank you {FirstName}{daoyou} for clearing up my confusion.
哎，早就猜到{daoyou}不靠谱，但没想到竟然会这么不靠谱。¤I knew {daoyou} would be unreliable, but I never thought it would be so unreliable.
喂，我感觉自己稍有突破，但苦于找不到合适的人切磋，不如{daoyou}来陪我练练手吧。全力出手，可别让我失望。¤Hey, I feel like I've made a slight breakthrough, but I'm struggling to find someone to spar with, so why don't {daoyou} come and practice with me? Don't let me down if you give it your all.
好，我也正有此意。不要误会，只是以后若有要事，方便{daoyou}与我联系而已。¤I'd like to do the same. Don't get me wrong, it's just that it's easier for {daoyou} to get in touch with me if there's something important in the future.
哼，真拿你没办法。别搞错了，我才不会对你有意思，只是一时想不到怎么拒绝你而已。¤I can't help it, I can't help you. Don't get me wrong, I'm not interested in you, I just can't think of a way to say no to you at the moment.
想多了吧，我和你可不熟，别来烦我。¤I don't know you very well, so don't bother me.
啊？{daoyou}是认真的么？¤Huh? Is {daoyou} serious?
先说好了，打输了可不许哭鼻子~¤Let's say it first, don't cry if you lose~
不错，徒儿果然没有让我失望~¤Yes, the disciple did not disappoint me~
哼哼，想胜过为师，你还差得远呢~¤Humph, if you want to be better than being a teacher, you are still a long way off~
{daoyou}，有多少能耐都拿出来吧~¤{Daoyou}, take out as much ability as you can~
哼哼，厉害吧？¤Humph, great, right?
什么？难道我现在不好看嘛...哼，也不是不行啦，让我来看看吧`¤What? Don't I look good now... Well, it's not that I can't. Let's see.
{daoyou}有此兴致，那我们点到为止就好。¤If {daoyou} is so inclined, then let's just stop there.
{daoyou}实力强大，在下甘拜下风。¤{daoyou} is very strong, I am very proud of him.
竟是{item}，{daoyou}真是独具慧眼，多谢。¤It's {item}, {daoyou} is very discerning, thank you.
{item}...{daoyou}的赠礼太贵重了，多谢。（可惜我暂时用不上...）¤{item}... Thank you for the gift from {daoyou}. （Unfortunately I won't be able to use it for a while...）
多谢{daoyou}的好意，只可惜我暂时用不上{item}。¤Thank you {daoyou} for your kind words, but unfortunately I can't use {item} at the moment.
这...{daoyou}为何要送我{item}？¤This... Why did {daoyou} send me {item}?
既然你如此想要，甚至不惜要动手，那便交给你吧。¤Since you want it so much that you even went out of your way to do it, I'll give it to you.
{daoyou}此举是因为遇到了难以启齿的困境么？那这{item}便让你拿去罢。¤Is {daoyou} making this move because you are in an unspeakable predicament? Then I will let you have this {item}.
{friendid}{qianbei}名声在外，我也是久仰多时了。{FirstName}{daoyou}既是{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，这{item}便送给你了。¤{friendid}{qianbei} is well-known, and I have heard so much about it for a long time. {First name}{Daoyou} is both {SpecRel} of {qianbei}, and this {item} will be given to you.
{friendid}{qianbei}...算了，这{item}便是交于你了。¤{friendid}{qianbei}. . . Forget it, this {item} is in your hands.
我一再容让，{daoyou}若是还要步步紧逼，那就怪不得我了！¤If {daoyou} is going to push me harder than I have let you, then it's not my fault!
{friendid}{qianbei}作为{friendlevel}强者，怎会放下身位不远万里来{diyu}插手小辈的纠纷。这{item}我不会给的。¤{friendid}{qianbei}As a strong {friendlevel}, how could he let go of his position and come thousands of miles to {diyu} to intervene in the disputes of the juniors. I won't give this {item}.
{friendid}{qianbei}素来公正不阿，{daoyou}还是别作无用的尝试了。¤{friendid}{qianbei} has always been fair, {Daoyou}don't make useless attempts.
用{friendid}威胁我恐怕没有太大意义。倒是{xiaoyou}此等行径可是有损你的名声，还是停手吧。¤There is no point in threatening me with {friendid}. It's {xiaoyou} who has tarnished your reputation, so stop.
呵呵，{FirstName}{daoyou}真是与众不同的诙谐。¤Oh, {FirstName}{daoyou} is really different witty.
这{item}虽是贵重，但{daoyou}应该是有难言之隐才需要它吧。¤The {item} is valuable, but I think {daoyou} needs it because he has something to hide.
纵使{item}不是什么珍宝，我也不能助长你的嚣张气焰！¤Even if {item} is not a treasure, I cannot encourage your arrogance!
这便是{FirstName}{daoyou}想要的{miji}了。¤This is the {miji} that {FirstName}{daoyou} wants.
难得与{FirstName}{daoyou}一见，还是聊聊这宁州的逸闻趣事吧。¤It's a rare meeting with {FirstName}{daoyou}, so let's talk about this Ningzhou escapade.
你我难得一见，还是不聊这枯涩的{miji}吧，莫要扫了{FirstName}{daoyou}的雅兴。¤You and I have a rare meeting, so let's not talk about this boring {miji}, don't spoil {FirstName}{daoyou}'s fun.
我最近在悟道时陷入瓶颈，久坐枯死也无法突破，要是有人能指点我一番就好了。不知{daoyou}...¤I've recently reached a bottleneck in my enlightenment, and I can't break through even after sitting down for a long time, so it would be nice if someone could give me some pointers. I wonder if {daoyou}...
希望我的浅薄学识，可以给{daoyou}带来些许灵感。¤I hope my superficial knowledge can bring {daoyou} some inspiration.
多谢{daoyou}解惑，此番真是获益匪浅。¤Thank you {daoyou} for clearing up the confusion, it has been very beneficial.
对不起，是我拖{daoyou}后腿了。¤I'm sorry I'm holding {daoyou} back.
对不起，是我悟性太差，拖了{qianbei}的后腿。¤Sorry, it was my poor understanding that dragged {qianbei}'s hind legs.
最近要指点师兄师妹战斗之事，但自己修行尚有不足，{daoyou}可愿切磋指点一番？¤I've recently had to instruct my siblings about fighting, but my own training is still lacking, would {daoyou} like to give some pointers?
{daoyou}所想正合我心意，以后多多联系。¤What {daoyou} wants is exactly what I want, so let's get in touch more often in the future.
我...我答应你...我会温柔待你的...也请{daoyou}...温柔待我...¤I... I... I promise you... I will be gentle with you... And please {daoyou}... Be gentle with me...
太好了...我...我也对{daoyou}倾慕已久...¤That's great... I... I've been a fan of {daoyou} for a long time too...
{daoyou}真会说笑。¤I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get the job done.
初次见面，你我二人点到为止便好。¤When we meet for the first time, you and I will be fine until the two of us order.
大比重在切磋比试，你我二人点到为止便好。¤A lot of people are learning and competing, and you and I will be fine until you and I can order it.
许久未与徒儿比试了，可有所精进？¤It's been a long time since I competed with my disciples, can I improve?
{daoyou}，我们点到为止便好。¤{Daoyou}, let's just click here.
{daoyou}实力不俗，我认输。¤{Daoyou} is not bad, I admit defeat.
{daoyou}，看来这次是我更胜一筹~¤{Daoyou}, it seems that I am better this time~
双修？好的，让我准备一下~真拿你没办法~¤Dual Cultivate? Okay, let me get ready first~ Honestly youre such a handful~
我输了。¤I lose.
哼，{daoyou}这是在羞辱我么？¤Is {daoyou} humiliating me?
{item}是你的了。¤{item}It's yours.
{friendid}...拿去。¤{friendid}... Here you go.
{friendid}...拿去...¤{friendid}... Take it...
来，动手，拿。¤Come on, do it, take it.
{friendid}{qianbei}，远在，{diyu}，之外。¤{friendid}{qianbei}, far away, {diyu}, far away.
他，不会，帮你。¤He, won't, help you.
...，无聊。¤... I'm bored.
{daoyou}可有时间交流一番悟道心得？¤{daoyou}Do you have time to share some enlightenment?
不错。¤Not bad.
多谢{daoyou}解惑。¤Thank you, {daoyou}, for clearing that up.
...，天道难求。¤... It's hard to find the Way of Heaven.
听说，{daoyou}很强，我想，挑战{daoyou}¤I've heard that {daoyou} is very strong, and I'd like to challenge {daoyou} to a fight.
尚需勤勉。¤Diligence is still required.
{daoyou}，请。¤{Daoyou}, please.
{daoyou}，厉害。¤{Daoyou}, awesome.
{daoyou}，承让。¤{Daoyou}, grant.
再敢看一眼，就别怪我不客气了！¤If you dare to look at it again, don't blame me for not being polite!
来来来，我早就手痒了。¤Come on, come on, I've been itching to get my hands on it for a long time.
哈哈，{daoyou}怎知我急需{item}？真是太及时了，感激不尽！¤Haha, how did {daoyou} know I was in desperate need of {item}? That's very timely and appreciated!
谢了啊。¤Thank you.
没想到{daoyou}如此大方，连{item}这等宝贝也舍得拿来送人，多谢多谢！¤I didn't expect {daoyou} to be so generous as to give away such a treasure as {item}, thank you very much!
这{item}你也拿来送人？算了算了，也是你的一片心意，我就不挑三拣四了。¤You gave this {item} away too? I'm not going to pick and choose.
哼，区区{item}也不值得大动干戈，便给你了。¤It's not worth the trouble, so I'll give it to you.
原来{FirstName}{daoyou}是{friendid}{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，那我就卖{qianbei}个面子，这{item}送你了。¤It turns out that {first name}{Daoyou} is {SpecRel} of {friendid}{qianbei}, then I will sell {qianbei} to save face, and this {item} will be given to you.
{friendid}{qianbei}...哈，哈哈哈，这{item}{daoyou}拿好了。¤{friendid}{qianbei}. . . Hahaha, hahaha, this {item}{Daoyou} is ready.
哼，你是什么鬼物？也敢威胁我？¤Hmph, what the hell are you? How dare you threaten me too?
哈哈哈，{friendid}{qianbei}难道还会为了你这小小的需求赶来{diyu}不成。¤Hahaha, would {friendid}{qianbei} still come to {diyu} for your little need?
{friendid}{qianbei}待我不薄，你怎敢当着我面辱{qianbei}声名！¤{friendid}{qianbei}treats me well, how dare you insult {qianbei}'s reputation in front of me!
{friendid}？不过是{friendid}修士，还会怕了你不成。¤I'm not sure if I'm a {friendid}? I'm just a {friendid} Cultivator, I'm not afraid of you.
哦？就这...这么会打趣，不愧是{daoyou}，啊{size=28}哈{/size}{size=26}哈{/size}{size=24}哈{/size}{size=22}哈{/size}{size=20}哈{/size}¤Oh? That's it... You're so funny, you're worthy of {daoyou}, ah {size=28}ha{/size}{size=26}ha{/size}{size=24}ha{/size}{size=22}ha{/size}{size=20}ha{/size}
三十年河东，三十年河西，{daoyou}可要把这{item}收好了！¤I'm not afraid of you.
要想从我手上拿走{item}可没这么简单，你还是动手抢吧，哼哼。¤It's not that easy to take {item} from my hand, you'd better make a grab for it, humph.
不就{miji}，这便就是了。¤It's just {miji}, that's all.
这{miji}乃我{shili}立身之本，{FirstName}{daoyou}还是打消这个念头吧。¤This {miji} is the foundation of my {shili} existence, {FirstName}{daoyou} let's not think about it.
我最近悟道陷入瓶颈，{daoyou}可愿交流交流？¤I have recently reached a bottleneck in my enlightenment, would {daoyou} like to share?
哈哈哈，就让我们好好交流交流吧。¤I'm not sure if I'll be able to get to know you.
哈，多谢{daoyou}指点。¤Ha, thanks {daoyou} for pointing me in the right direction.
哈，与{daoyou}交流后才发觉悟道原来这么简单。¤I found it so easy to become enlightened after talking to {daoyou}.
最近闲来无事，手痒得紧，{daoyou}快来陪我玩玩。¤I've got nothing to do lately and I'm itching to play with {daoyou}.
好，我也正有此意。以后找{daoyou}切磋就方便多了哈哈哈。¤I'd like to do the same. It will be much easier to find {daoyou} to spar with in the future hahaha.
{daoyou}可别拿我寻开心了。¤The {daoyou} don't make fun of me.
{daoyou}若是再拿我说笑，头都给你打飞。¤{daoyou}If you ever make fun of me again, your head will be blown off.
来来来，{daoyou}，我早就手痒了。¤Come on, {Daoyou}, my hands are itchy.
麻了麻了…真是了不得。¤It's numb... it's amazing.
{daoyou}，这是要干什么？¤What's this about {daoyou}?
呵呵，还请{daoyou}手下留情。¤Oh, please be merciful to {daoyou}.
有点意思。¤That's interesting.
在下正急需{item}，就不跟{daoyou}客气了，相赠之情必不敢忘。¤I'm in desperate need of {item}, so I won't be too polite to {daoyou}, I won't forget the gift.
承蒙{FirstName}{daoyou}厚爱，那在下就却之不恭了。¤I'd like to thank {FirstName}{daoyou} for his kindness, so I'll be grateful.
{FirstName}{daoyou}真是别出心裁，只可惜这{item}在下暂时用不上。¤{FirstName}{daoyou} is very original, but unfortunately I won't be able to use this {item} for a while.
{daoyou}身上的{item}在下甚是喜欢，借在下一用如何？¤I like the {item} on {daoyou}, how about lending it to me?
呵呵，这{item}能被你看上是在下的荣幸。¤It is an honour for me to have this {item} in your eyes.
真是令我意外的选择，我还以为自己很了解你。¤What a surprising choice for me, and I thought I knew you well.
{friendid}{qianbei}实力之强可谓是闻名遐迩，在下也是爱慕已久。{FirstName}{daoyou}既是{friendid}{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，这{item}便有劳给{qianbei}了。¤{friendid}{qianbei}is famous for its strength, and I have long admired it. {First name}{Daoyou} is both {SpecRel} of {friendid}{qianbei}, and this{item} will be paid to {qianbei}.
呵呵，{friendid}{qianbei}之名在下爱慕已久，这{item}便送{daoyou}了。¤Hehe, the name {friendid}{qianbei} has been admired for a long time, and this {item} will be given to {Daoyou}.
{daoyou}的交流方式真是特别，不过巧了，在下也不是什么软柿子。¤The {daoyou} way of communication is really special, but coincidentally, I'm not a soft touch either.
呵呵，{friendid}{qianbei}仙务繁忙，又怎会将区区在下的些微冒犯记挂于心。¤Hehe, {friendid}{qianbei} is busy with Immortal affairs, so how can he keep the slight offense in his heart.
哦？这可不是我印象中{friendid}{qianbei}能容忍的行为，{FirstName}{daoyou}还是注意点为上。¤Oh? This is not the behavior that {friendid}{qianbei} can tolerate in my impression. {First name}{Daoyou} should pay attention.
久仰{friendid}{daoyou}的名号了，不过这还不足以让在下改变心意。¤I've heard a lot about {friendid} {daoyou}, but that's not enough to make me change my mind.
看来{daoyou}近来心情甚是不错，竟有时间拿在下打趣。¤It seems that {daoyou} has been in a very good mood lately, and has had time to make fun of me.
看来这{item}跟{daoyou}更有缘，在下只好双手奉上了，呵呵。¤It seems that this {item} is more in tune with {daoyou}, so I'll have to give it to you with both hands.
{FirstName}{qianbei}真会为了这{item}对在下动手么？这可不太划算，还是三思为上。¤{First name}{qianbei} Would you really do something to me for this {item}? This is not very cost-effective, so it's better to think twice.
{daoyou}真要为了这{item}对在下动手么？纵是{daoyou}实力比在下强上许多，但后果也不是那么简单就能化解的，可要考虑好了。¤I think it's better to think twice. Even if {daoyou} is much stronger than I am, the consequences will not be so simple to resolve, so think carefully.
这{miji}虽颇为珍稀，但既然{FirstName}{daoyou}开口了，在下自然不会拒绝。¤The {miji} is quite rare, but since {FirstName}{daoyou} has asked for it, I will not refuse.
这{miji}在下得来不易，怕是不能轻易传授给{FirstName}{daoyou}。¤This {miji} was not easy for me to obtain, so I am afraid I cannot easily pass it on to {FirstName}{daoyou}.
在下也想将这{miji}传授于{FirstName}{daoyou}，奈何宗门之命难以违抗，见谅。¤I would also like to pass on this {miji} to {FirstName}{daoyou}, but it is difficult to disobey the orders of the clan, so forgive me.
听闻{daoyou}精于悟道及讲法，在下刚好遇到瓶颈，不知{daoyou}可愿指点在下一番？¤I heard that {daoyou} is good at enlightenment and dharma teaching, and I have just hit a bottleneck.
既然{daoyou}有意相邀，那在下就却之不恭了。¤Since {daoyou} is interested in inviting me, I would be honoured.
闻{daoyou}之道，可见天地万象，甚好，甚好。¤It is good to hear {daoyou}'s way and see the heaven and earth.
{daoyou}对道的领悟，令在下只能望洋兴叹。¤I can only marvel at {daoyou}'s understanding of the Tao.
看来在下今天不在状态，下次再陪{daoyou}论道吧。¤It seems that I am not in my element today, so I will discuss the Tao with {daoyou} next time.
看来在下今天不在状态，下次再找{daoyou}论道吧。¤It seems that I am not in my element today, so I will have a discussion with {daoyou} next time.
听闻{daoyou}同境内战力无双，不知今日在下可有幸见识见识？¤I heard that {daoyou} has unparalleled combat power within the same territory, I wonder if I will have the pleasure of seeing it today?
哼，在下和你之间没有什么可说的。¤Hmph, there is nothing to say between me and you.
在下与{daoyou}相谈甚欢，也正有以后多多联系之意。还请{daoyou}将神识信息留于在下传音符中。¤I have had a good conversation with {daoyou} and I have just the intention to contact you more in the future. I would also ask {daoyou} to leave a soul imprint for my transmission talisman.
噢？难得{daoyou}有此兴致，请！¤Oh? It's rare that {daoyou} is willing to do this, please!
只要把{item}交出来，你就能保下一条命，这可是赚了。¤Just hand {item} over and you will save a life, it's a profit.
{daoyou}不用如此，不过是{item}，你若需要，拿去便是。¤No need for {daoyou}, it's just {item}, if you need it, just take it.
请{daoyou}谅解，这{miji}我不能传授于你。¤Please {daoyou} understand, I can't teach you this {miji}.
无妨，我再尝试下其他方法吧。¤No matter, I'll try another method.
{daoyou}，这次我就不计较了。¤I'll let it go this time, {daoyou}.
偶尔活动活动身子骨也不错，来吧。¤It's good to move your bones once in a while, come on.
哈哈哈，痛快，痛快！¤Hahahaha, that hurts, that hurts!
是{item}？{daoyou}怎知我正在寻找此物？¤Is it {item}? How did {daoyou} know I was looking for this?
{item}这种宝贝有缘者得之，你好像跟它不太搭，还是交给我吧。¤You don't seem to be a good match for it, so give it to me.
哎，这{item}不过身外之物，便交给你吧。¤I'll give it to you.
威胁？呵，我可不吃这套。¤Threats? I don't take that as a threat.
偶尔活动活动身子骨也不错，来吧，{daoyou}。¤It's good to move your body occasionally, come on, {Daoyou}.
{daoyou}资质太差，还是努力修练吧。¤The {daoyou} Aptitude is too poor, so you should work hard on your training.
哈哈哈，这天地间能懂我的唯有{FirstName}{daoyou}而已！¤The only one who understands me in this world is {FirstName}{daoyou}!
呵，拿走吧。修仙艰难，{daoyou}可要当心别碰着什么意外，就这么陨落了。¤Heh, take it away. Cultivating immortality is tough, {daoyou} be careful not to run into any accidents and just fall off.
我还道{friendid}{qianbei}乃凡尘谪仙，居红尘而不染，原来也会结识你这种仗势欺人的败类，哼，不过如此。¤I also said that {friendid}{qianbei} is a immortal who lives in the red dust and does not stain. It turns out that he will also get acquainted with scum like you who deceive others, huh, but that's it.
会一点微末之技就想发不义之财？要不是我今天心情不错，倒要好好教训教训你！¤I'm not sure if I'm in a good mood today. If I wasn't in a good mood today, I'd teach you a lesson!
哼，{friendid}还能为你这威胁而出手对付一个小辈不成？¤I don't think {friendid} would take on a youngster for a threat like that.
{friendid}这满口正道的{qianbei}，可不会容许你滥用其名声，好自为之吧。¤{friendid} This {qianbei} who is full of righteousness, will not allow you to abuse your reputation, so do it yourself.
{daoyou}的名号我倒还有所耳闻，至于{friendlevel}强者{friendid}，不过是个笑话耳。¤I've heard of {daoyou}, but the {friendlevel} strongman {friendid} is just a joke.
{daoyou}是在尝试用如此拙劣的手法逗我笑？哈，哈，哈。¤I think {daoyou} is trying to make me laugh with such a clumsy technique? Ha, ha, ha.
呵，拿走吧。修仙艰难，{daoyou}可要当心天劫，别轻易陨落了。¤Take it away. Cultivation of immortality is difficult, {daoyou} must beware of the heavenly tribulation and not fall so easily.
哼，{item}此等珍宝，自是有缘者得之，凭什么让我交出来。¤I'm not sure why I should hand it over.
哼，我倒是要试试，若是不交出{item}，你能把我怎样！¤I'd like to see what you can do to me if I don't hand over {item}!
既然{daoyou}有幸碰到我不忙，便陪你消磨一番吧。¤Since {daoyou} are lucky enough to come across me not being busy, let's spend some time with you.
哼，指点你真累。¤I'm tired of pointing you out.
哼，还凑活吧。¤Hm, it's not too bad.
哼，就这？真是浪费我时间。¤Hm, that's it? What a waste of my time.
哼，我就不该找你。¤I should never have asked you.
好，{FirstName}{daoyou}与那些废物不同，有资格与我联系。¤Good, {FirstName}{daoyou} are entitled to contact me unlike those losers.
{daoyou}，你最好用上全力。¤{Daoyou}, you'd better use all your strength.
{daoyou}还是多多努力修练为好。¤{Daoyou} is better to practice hard.
{daoyou}再看，就要收钱了？¤{daoyou}Again, you're going to charge money?
虽然没有好处，看你的面子就和你过几招。¤Although there is no benefit, for your sake I will play a few moves with you.
要是点到为止，你已经输了。¤If it's on point, you've already lost.
{daoyou}实力不错，无需气馁。¤{daoyou}Good strength, no need to be discouraged.
{item}！{daoyou}与我交情如此之好，我就不作推辞了，嘿嘿。¤{item}! {daoyou}I will not be a pushover since I have such a good friendship with you, hehehe.
嘶...这{item}可是相当值钱的宝贝，{daoyou}有心了。¤Heh... This {item} is quite a valuable treasure, {daoyou} have a heart.
你的{item}不错，不过现在是我的了。快交出来吧，不然我可就不客气了嘿嘿嘿。¤Your {item} is nice, but it's mine now. Hand it over or I'll be rude hehehehe.
真是流年不利，今天就不该出门，哎，没...没什么！我是说这{item}就是你才配拥有！¤What a bad year, I shouldn't have gone out today, oops, no... Nothing! I'm just saying that you deserve this {item}!
我虽心性贪婪倒还顾及朋友情谊，没想到你竟胜我不止一筹。¤I'm greedy but I'm a friend, but I didn't think you'd be able to beat me by more than a mile.
若不是看在{friendid}{qianbei}的面子上，我才不会把{item}交出来。¤If it weren't for the face of {friendid}{qianbei}, I wouldn't hand over {item}.
{daoyou}是在为{friendid}{qianbei}办事？这{item}就当孝敬{friendid}{qianbei}了。¤{Daoyou} is working for {friendid}{qianbei}? This {item} should be regarded as filial piety {friendid}{qianbei}.
嘿嘿嘿，巧取豪夺是很不错，但{daoyou}这次怕不是找错人了。¤Hey, hey, hey, it's all very well to steal by trickery, but I'm afraid {daoyou} didn't have the wrong person this time.
凭{friendid}{qianbei}之能，赶到{diyu}惩治我的时间都够他搜集不知多少{item}了，又怎会浪费这个时间？¤With the ability of {friendid}{qianbei}, he rushed to {diyu} to punish me enough time for him to collect I don't know how many {items}, so how could he waste this time?
就算真惹怒{friendid}{qianbei}了，也不过认个错，挨个罚就是了，你还想借此骗取我宝物？嘿，想都别想。¤Even if you really irritate {friendid}{qianbei}, you can just admit your mistake and be punished one by one. Do you still want to use this to defraud my treasure? Hey, don't even think about it.
哼，这{item}别说是你和这什么{friendid}要，就是白帝亲自来了我也不会给的。¤I will not give this {item} even if you and this {friendid} want it, even if the White Emperor himself comes.
这话题真无聊，还是聊聊{daoyou}最近又在机缘中获得了什么宝贝吧。¤This is a boring topic, let's talk about what treasures {daoyou} has recently acquired by chance again.
以我们的交情，区区{miji}自不在话下。¤With our friendship, a mere {miji} is not a matter of concern.
嘿嘿，{daoyou}想学{miji}的话，是不是该意思意思。¤I'm not sure if you want to learn {miji}, but if you want to learn {miji}, you should do it.
{FirstName}{daoyou}，{miji}乃我派立身之本，怕是不能轻易教你。¤{FirstName}{daoyou}, {miji} is the foundation of my school, so I'm afraid I can't teach you that easily.
我最近在修炼中遇到了一些瓶颈，枯坐闭关已然无用。不知{daoyou}可否愿意与在下探讨一番，交流悟道之心得。¤I have recently encountered some bottlenecks in my cultivation, and sitting in seclusion is no longer useful. I wonder if {daoyou} would be willing to discuss with me and exchange ideas on how to achieve enlightenment.
与{daoyou}探讨一番真是思绪颇多，有机会多多交流。¤I've been thinking a lot about {daoyou}, so I'll have the opportunity to share more.
我最近新得一件法宝，{daoyou}可有空陪我磨合一番？¤I have recently acquired a new magic weapon, would {daoyou} have time to work with me on it?
太好了，我也正有此意。{daoyou}若是有机缘，别忘了带我一个嘿嘿。¤That's great, I'd love to do that. {daoyou}If you have the chance, don't forget to bring me one hehehe.
{daoyou}的财...哦不，性格深得我心，很高兴能与{daoyou}结缘。¤{daoyou}'s fortune... Oh no, the character is deep in my heart and I'm glad to have bonded with {daoyou}.
看在{daoyou}送礼颇丰的份上，此次就当无事发生。¤I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a good deal on this.
{daoyou}，有多少能耐就都拿出来吧。¤{Daoyou}, take it as much as you can.
要不是点到为止，{daoyou}你已经输了。¤If you hadn't clicked, {Daoyou} you'd already lost.
终于等到这一天了。¤At last the day has come.
哼，不自量力！¤Hmph, out of your depth!
我会手下留情的。¤I will be merciful.
以你我的关系，区区{miji}，好说好说。¤With your relationship and mine, a mere {miji}, good talk.
哼，狗屁不通。¤Hmph, bullshit.
和{daoyou}结缘于我亦有好处，可以。¤It's also good for me to have a relationship with {daoyou}.
{daoyou}莫非是认为戏弄我很有意思？¤I don't know if {daoyou} thought it would be fun to tease me.
你赢了，甘拜下风。¤You win, willingly.
{item}交出来，饶你一命。¤Hand over the {item} and I'll spare your life.
{friendid}？不明白，你在，说什么。¤{friendid}? I don't understand, what are you, talking about.
...，浪费时间。¤... ...wasting time.
喜欢。¤Liked.
嗯？！没有下次啦啊！！？？¤What? There's no next time, is there?
好好好！这{item}我可是想要很久了！¤I've wanted this for a long time! I've been wanting this {item} for a long time!
识相的就赶紧把{item}交出来，我可没什么耐心。¤Give me the {item} if you know what you're doing, I don't have much patience.
啊？{daoyou}是故意来浪费我时间的？¤I don't have much patience. Did {daoyou} come here to waste my time on purpose?
哈哈哈哈，痛快，痛快！¤Hahahaha, happy, happy!
{xiaoyou}此举何意？¤What does {xiaoyou} mean by that?
{xiaoyou}此举莫不是过于猖狂！¤I don't think {xiaoyou} is being too arrogant!
噢？你想做什么？¤Oh? What do you want to do?
那我便与{xiaoyou}切磋一二。¤Then I will have a sparring session with {xiaoyou}.
好好好，真是后生可畏啊。¤Well, well, well, well... A young man is a young man.
{xiaoyou}，我没伤到你吧？¤I didn't hurt you, did I, {xiaoyou}?
我恰好就急需这{item}，真是多谢{xiaoyou}了！¤I happen to be in desperate need of this {item}, so thank you {xiaoyou}!
哈哈哈，{xiaoyou}此礼甚得我心。¤Hahahaha, {xiaoyou}'s gift is very much to my liking.
这{item}我虽然暂时用不上，却也是相当贵重的礼物，多谢{xiaoyou}了。¤Although I won't be able to use this {item} for a while, it's still a very valuable gift, thank you {xiaoyou}.
这{item}我虽然用不上，倒也算是你的一片心意。¤I won't be able to use this {item}, but it's a token of your appreciation.
这...{xiaoyou}为何要送我这{item}？¤This... Why did {xiaoyou} give me this {item}?
嗯，虽然出人意料倒也能理解吧，这{item}就让{xiaoyou}拿去罢。¤Well, I guess it's understandable that it's unexpected, so I'll let {xiaoyou} have it.
原来是{friendid}{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，那这{item}便交给{xiaoyou}。¤It turned out to be {specrel} of {friendid}{qianbei}, then this {item} will be handed over to {xiaoyou}.
哼，{xiaoyou}若有本事，就自己来拿试试！¤If {xiaoyou} has the ability, he can try to take it himself!
啊？竟然是和我同名的{friendlevel}修士么？嗯？{xiaoyou}是在想借此威胁我？哦哦，{size=29}只{/size}{size=28}是{/size}{size=27}在{/size}{size=26}开{/size}{size=25}玩{/size}{size=24}笑{/size}{size=23}啊{/size}，{size=22}哈{/size}{size=20}哈{/size}{size=18}哈{/size}{size=20}。{/size}¤What? I'm not sure if it's a {friendlevel} Cultivator with the same name as me? I don't know. Is {xiaoyou} trying to threaten me with this? Oh oh, {size=28}Just {/size}{size=27}kidding {/size}{size=26}with {/size}{size=25}me {/size}{size=24}Aha {/size}{size=23}ha {/size},{size=22}ha {/size}{size=20}ha {/size}{size=18}ha {/size}{size=20}.{/size}
{miji}？{FirstName}{xiaoyou}拿去吧。¤{miji}? {FirstName}{xiaoyou} take it.
{FirstName}{xiaoyou}，你我之间关系虽好，但这{miji}我也不能白白教你啊。¤{FirstName}{xiaoyou}, although we have a good relationship, I can't teach you this {miji} for nothing.
唉，{FirstName}{xiaoyou}有所不知，这{miji}乃是我{shili}的不传之秘，我可无权擅自传授。¤I don't know, {FirstName}{xiaoyou} doesn't know, this {miji} is my {shili} secret, I don't have the right to pass it on without permission.
{xiaoyou}资质不错，想指点{xiaoyou}一番，意下如何？¤But {xiaoyou} has good Aptitudes and would like to teach {xiaoyou} a few things, what do you think?
便让我来为{xiaoyou}讲法，细听。¤Let me tell {xiaoyou} about the teachings and listen carefully.
{xiaoyou}实属天资聪颖，稍加点拨便能理解透彻。¤{xiaoyou} is very gifted, so with a little bit of guidance he will be able to understand it thoroughly.
与{xiaoyou}相谈，也令我收益颇丰。¤I have also gained a lot from talking to {xiaoyou}.
此次与{xiaoyou}相谈甚欢，只可惜...¤I had a great conversation with {xiaoyou}, but unfortunately...
多谢{xiaoyou}相助，只可惜...¤Thank you {xiaoyou} for your help, but unfortunately...
{xiaoyou}还是等修为再精进些后，再来与我论道吧。¤I think {xiaoyou} should come back to discuss with me after his cultivation has improved a bit more.
我这几日正在修炼一门神通，{xiaoyou}可有兴致陪我过上几手？¤I'm training a divine skill these days, would {xiaoyou} be willing to play a few hands with me?
太好了，我也正有此意。日后若有要事，{xiaoyou}便可通过这传音符和我联系了。¤That's great, I'd like to do that too. If there is something important in the future, {xiaoyou} will be able to contact me through this sound transmission talisman.
这...{xiaoyou}是认真的么？¤Is this... Is {xiaoyou} serious?
哼，我和你之间没有什么可交易的。¤Hm, there is nothing to trade between me and you.
原来是{FirstName}{xiaoyou}。既然{xiaoyou}有此需要，那我便不与你争了。¤So it was {FirstName}{xiaoyou}. Since {xiaoyou} has this need, then I won't compete with you.
原来是{xiaoyou}...你也对我这条灵脉感兴趣么？¤So it's {xiaoyou}... Are you also interested in this spiritual vein of mine?
{xiaoyou}，此处灵脉是我先抢得的，还请移步他处。¤{xiaoyou}, I grabbed this spirit vein first, so please move to another place.
{xiaoyou}，小心了。¤{xiaoyou}, be careful.
徒儿，小心了。¤Disciple, be careful.
放心，{xiaoyou}，我不会下手太重的。¤Don't worry, {xiaoyou}, I won't hit too hard.
真乃是后生可畏啊。¤It's really terrifying.
能有机会观摩{daoyou}渡劫飞升，是我的荣幸。¤It was an honour to have the opportunity to observe {daoyou}'s ascension through the tribulation.
{daoyou}，感觉怎么样？没有弄伤你吧？希望能够有所收获呢。¤{daoyou}, how are you feeling? Didn't hurt you, did it? I hope it was productive.
{xiaoyou}，出招吧。¤I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that.
好好好，{xiaoyou}修为精深。¤I'm sure {xiaoyou} has a profound cultivation.
没想到{xiaoyou}竟是如此心性贪婪之人，我算是看走眼了。¤I didn't expect {xiaoyou} to be such a greedy person, I was wrong about him.
久仰{friendid}{qianbei}大名，既然{FirstName}{xiaoyou}是{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，这{item}拿去便是，不用客气。¤I have long admired the name {friendid}{qianbei}. Since {First name}{xiaoyou} is {SpecRel} of {qianbei}, just take this {item}. You are welcome.
怎么，{xiaoyou}是把我当软柿子了？¤What, does {xiaoyou} think I'm a soft touch?
{xiaoyou}若是空闲，不如多修炼，莫要做这些无聊之事。¤{Xiaoyou}If you are free, why not cultivate more and don't do these boring things.
这{miji}虽然贵重，但相较于{FirstName}{xiaoyou}与我的感情还是不值一提。¤This {miji} is valuable, but it's nothing compared to the bond {FirstName}{xiaoyou} has with me.
请{xiaoyou}谅解，这{miji}乃我{shili}不传之秘，恕我无权外传。¤Please understand {xiaoyou}, this {miji} is a secret that I {shili} do not pass on, so I am sorry that I have no right to pass it on.
我最近修练时偶遇瓶颈，几经枯坐后仍无收获，{xiaoyou}要是有空，可否与我探讨一番，交流悟道之心得，说不定我也会有新的启发。¤I have recently encountered a bottleneck in my training, and after sitting down for a few days I have not gained anything. If {xiaoyou} is free, can you discuss this with me and share your enlightenment, perhaps I will also gain new inspiration.
那便让我给{xiaoyou}展示一番我所悟之道吧，献丑了。¤Then let me show {xiaoyou} what I have learnt.
假以时日，{xiaoyou}大道可求矣。¤In time, {xiaoyou} will be able to seek the Great Way.
大道难求，论道没有收获不过是修仙路上的寻常事而已，{xiaoyou}不必气馁。¤It's hard to find the great path, and it's just a common thing on the road to immortality that you don't get anything out of it, so {xiaoyou} needn't be discouraged.
不打紧，不打紧，大道难求而已。¤It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, the great Tao is hard to find.
{xiaoyou}如今修为尚浅，还是不要好高骛远。等你修为再精进些，再来与我论道吧。¤You should not be overly ambitious as your cultivation is still shallow. When your cultivation is more advanced, you can come back and discuss the dao with me.
闲来无事，{xiaoyou}可愿与我过上几手聊以消遣？¤If you have nothing else to do, would {xiaoyou} like to play a few hands with me for fun?
好，若是有要事，除闭关之外如无意外我会随时回复{xiaoyou}的。¤I will reply to {xiaoyou} if I have something important to do, except for the retreat.
我对{xiaoyou}也爱慕已久，但挑选道侣毕竟是大事，在此之前我还有几个问题想要问{xiaoyou}。¤I've been in love with {xiaoyou} for a long time, but choosing a partner is a big deal after all, so I have a few questions for {xiaoyou} beforehand.
细细想来，我似乎没有什么理由拒绝你...那么,{xiaoyou}，以后请多关照哦。¤When I think about it, I don't seem to have any reason to say no to you... So, {xiaoyou}, please take care of me in the future.
{xiaoyou}是认真的么？¤Is {xiaoyou} serious?
{xiaoyou}还是不要开这种玩笑比较好。¤{Xiaoyou}It's better not to make such jokes.
{xiaoyou}，全力攻过来罢。¤{xiaoyou}, strike with all your strength.
{xiaoyou}修为精深，当真小瞧不得。¤{xiaoyou} has a profound cultivation base, so I really don't look down on it.
能观摩{daoyou}渡劫飞升，我一定大有收获。¤It surely will have been very rewarding for me to observe {daoyou}'s ascension through the tribulation.
{daoyou}，双修虽有益，要适可而止才行。¤{daoyou}, although dual cultivation is beneficial, it must be done in moderation.
喂，{xiaoyou}不规矩哦。¤I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that.
我也正想活动活动筋骨，来吧！¤I'd like to get some exercise too, come on!
哈哈哈，{xiaoyou}的实力真是令人刮目相看。¤The strength of {xiaoyou} is really impressive.
哈哈哈，{xiaoyou}能在我手下撑到这个地步，已经很不错啦。¤Hahahaha, {xiaoyou} did well to hold out under me.
{xiaoyou}此举真如干天落慈雨，解我心头大患，多谢！¤This is like rain falling from the sky, it's a great relief.
送给我的？这可是难得一见的{item}。{xiaoyou}破费了。¤For me? This is a rare {item}. {xiaoyou} It's a waste of money.
多谢{xiaoyou}赠礼，不过这{item}我倒也用不上。¤Thank you {xiaoyou} for the gift, but I don't really need this {item}.
还道{xiaoyou}是我知音，原来不过是条势利的饿狼，呵。¤I thought {xiaoyou} was my soulmate, but it turns out he's just a snobbish hungry wolf.
此间有山间清风，天上明月与壶中美酒，{FirstName}{xiaoyou}何必执着于{miji}呢？¤There's a breeze in the mountains; the moon in the sky and wine in your jug, {FirstName}{xiaoyou} why bother with {miji}?
怀璧于身不外露，立身之本怎轻传，{xiaoyou}还是学其他的吧。¤I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get the best out of you.
现下无事，{xiaoyou}可愿听我啰嗦几句天地大道之事？¤Now that I have nothing to do, would {xiaoyou} like to listen to a few words about the Great Way of Heaven and Earth?
左右无事，便指点{xiaoyou}一番吧。¤I have nothing to do, so I'll give {xiaoyou} some guidance.
稍加点拨而已，不足挂齿。¤It's just a little bit of guidance, it's nothing to worry about.
好，好，好！{xiaoyou}对道的见地，连我也眼前一亮。¤Yes, yes, yes! {xiaoyou}'s insight into the Dao is so bright that even I can see it.
{xiaoyou}毋需挂心，有机会再一起论道吧。¤Don't worry about it, we'll talk about it again sometime.
只是探讨而已，{xiaoyou}不用在意。¤It's just a discussion, {xiaoyou} don't worry about it.
哈哈哈哈哈...{xiaoyou}还是去找你同辈的娃娃们论道吧。¤I don't want to be a part of it. {xiaoyou}Go and talk to your fellow dolls.
左右无事，{xiaoyou}可愿交流交流战斗经验聊以消遣？¤I have nothing to do, so {xiaoyou} would like to share your combat experience for fun?
好，以后游历中有什么见闻也方便与{xiaoyou}分享。¤I'd like to share my experiences with {xiaoyou} in the future.
什么？{xiaoyou}是认真的么？¤What? Is {xiaoyou} serious?
哈哈哈，既然{xiaoyou}如此盛邀，那我自然不会拒绝。¤I'm not going to say no to {xiaoyou}'s invitation.
正想活动活动筋骨，来吧！¤Just want to move your muscles and bones, come on!
哈哈哈，早就想与{xiaoyou}放开手脚大战一场了！¤Hahaha, I have long wanted to start a war with {xiaoyou}!
全力以赴吧，让为师看看你学的如何了。¤Go all out and let the teacher see how you are doing.
真过瘾，不过呀，{daoyou}你可得好好修炼才行呢。¤It's really enjoyable, but {daoyou} you'll have to work on it.
哈哈，{xiaoyou}可发现什么有趣的物事？¤Haha, did {xiaoyou} find anything interesting?
疼疼疼！{xiaoyou}快停手，我不和你打了！¤Ouch, ouch, ouch! Stop it, I'm not going to fight you!
好好好，这{item}我可是喜欢的紧啊！¤I love this {item}, I love this {item}!
哇，竟然是{item}！这可是相当贵重的礼物，多谢{xiaoyou}！¤Wow, it's an {item}! This is a very valuable gift, thank you {xiaoyou}!
巧取不成，{xiaoyou}还想强夺试试？¤If you can't get it by force, how can {xiaoyou} try to take it by force?
你居然为了{item}威...唉？等等，这不就是我么，原来{FirstName}{xiaoyou}在跟我开玩笑啊哈哈。¤You actually for {item} wi... Lol? Wait, isn't that me, so {FirstName}{xiaoyou} is joking with me haha.
{FirstName}{xiaoyou}，白嫖可不好啊哈哈哈。¤{FirstName}{xiaoyou}, it's no good whoring for nothing hahaha.
哈，正想找个人探讨悟道心得就碰到了{xiaoyou}，不知可有时间与我交流一番？说不定对我有些新的启发。¤I was looking for someone to discuss my enlightenment with and I came across {xiaoyou}. I'm sure I'll find some new inspiration.
哈哈，正有此意，就让我来指点{xiaoyou}一番。¤Haha, my idea exactly, come let me guide {xiaoyou} abit.
哈哈，{xiaoyou}这等悟性实属少见。¤Haha, {xiaoyou} this kind of enlightenment is rare.
哈哈哈，不愧是{FirstName}{xiaoyou}，居然能让论道这么有趣。¤It's a good thing that {FirstName}{xiaoyou} can make the sermon so interesting.
论道真是无趣，不论了，不论了。¤The sermon is really boring, no more, no more.
今天不适合论道哈哈哈，当下还是去找点乐子，改日再论吧。¤It's not the right day for a sermon hahaha, so I'll go have some fun right now and discuss it another day.
哈，{xiaoyou}好久不见，可愿切磋一番增进下感情？¤I've seen you for a long time, {xiaoyou}, would you like to have a sparring session to improve your relationship?
太好了，我也正有此意。以后{xiaoyou}多跟我分享一点有趣的见闻哈哈哈。¤That's great, that's what I was thinking. I'd like to share more interesting stories with {xiaoyou} in the future hahaha.
玩笑也不能这么开吧，（xiaoyou）好像不太聪明的样子。¤You can't make jokes like this, right? {xiaoyou} It doesn't seem very clever.
哈哈，{xiaoyou}不是在和我开玩笑吧？¤I'm not kidding {xiaoyou}, am I?
来来来，咱俩好好比试一番。¤Come on, let's have a good competition.
{xiaoyou}，咱俩可要好好比试一番！¤{xiaoyou}, let's have a good competition!
疼疼疼！{xiaoyou}，快停手，我不和你打了！¤Ouch! Ouch! {I'm not going to fight you!
这劫云...若换作是我，确实也没有十足的把握啊...¤This Tribulation cloud... If it were me, I really wouldn't be sure...
放心，我会手下留情的。¤Don't worry, I'll be lenient.
哼，切磋本是点到为止，没想到你为了胜利竟然偷袭我一个老前辈。¤I don't think you'll be able to sneak up on an old-timer like me just to win.
哼，不值一提。¤Hmph, it's not worth mentioning.
居...居然是{item}！我正需...咳咳...为了不让{xiaoyou}尴尬，我就大发慈悲的收下吧！¤How dare... I can't believe it's {item}! I was in need of... Ahem... So as not to embarrass {xiaoyou}, I'll take it in mercy!
居然！？咳咳，看在{xiaoyou}诚心相送的份上，我就收下了。¤I can't believe it! Ahem, for the sake of {xiaoyou}'s sincere gift, I'll take it.
虽然{xiaoyou}送的礼物不合我心意，但也不必过于在意。毕竟我的品味不是谁都能领会的。¤Although the gift from {xiaoyou} is not to my liking, there is no need to be overly concerned. After all, my taste is not something that anyone can appreciate.
{item}？{xiaoyou}莫不是在拿我寻开心？¤{item}? Is {xiaoyou} not making fun of me?
哼，{xiaoyou}所为真是令人不耻。¤What {xiaoyou} has done is disgraceful.
我最近在悟道时遇到一些瓶颈，{xiaoyou}可有时间交流交流？若是没空就算了，我自己也可以解决。¤I have recently encountered some bottlenecks in my enlightenment, do {xiaoyou} have time to share? If you don't have time, forget it, I can solve it myself.
刚好闲得无聊，便陪{xiaoyou}消磨一番吧。¤I'm just bored, so I'll spend some time with {xiaoyou}.
不过是消磨一下时间而已，才算不上什么指点。¤It's just a bit of time to kill, not a lot of guidance.
很...还，还凑活吧。¤It's very... It's still, it's not too bad.
失败了？倒也是意料之中吧。¤Failed? Well, I guess that's to be expected.
还好我没对{xiaoyou}抱什么希望。¤It's a good thing I didn't get my hopes up for {xiaoyou}.
{xiaoyou}实力还不够，别来浪费我时间。¤{xiaoyou} isn't strong enough to waste my time.
喂，我感觉自己稍有突破，但苦于找不到合适的人切磋，不如{xiaoyou}来陪我练练手吧。可别让我失望。¤Hey, I feel like I've made a breakthrough, but I'm struggling to find someone to spar with, so why don't {xiaoyou} come and practice with me? Don't let me down.
好，我也正有此意。不要误会，只是以后若有要事，方便{xiaoyou}与我联系而已。¤I'd like to do the same. Don't get me wrong, it's just convenient for {xiaoyou} to contact me if there's something important in the future.
好啦好啦，就算是便宜你了。哼哼，日后若敢负了我，定要你生不如死！¤Fine, Fine, you won this time. Hmph, if you dare to take advantage of me again in the future, I'll make you suffer a fate worse than death!
哼，真拿{xiaoyou}你没办法...就算是便宜你了。日后若敢负了我，定要你生不如死！¤I can't do anything about {xiaoyou}... I'll let you off the hook. If you dare to betray me in the future, I will make your life worse than death!
啊？{xiaoyou}是认真的么？¤Huh? Is {xiaoyou} serious?
待会儿来找为师哭鼻子吧~¤Come and cry for the teacher later~
竟然？咳咳，这次是为师大意了…¤it turns out? Ahem, this time it's for the teacher's carelessness...
输给为师也不是什么丢人的事情啦~¤It's not a shame to lose to a teacher~
放心，{xiaoyou}，我会手下留情的。¤Don't worry, {xiaoyou}, I will show mercy.
输在我手里可是你的荣幸~¤It's your honor to lose in my hands~
别误会...我可没有被这天劫吓到。¤Don't get me wrong... I'm not intimidated by this heavenly Tribulation.
（对方眉头一皱）嗯？¤（A frown on his face） Hmm?
{xiaoyou}，你我切磋交流，点到为止就好。¤I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get in touch with you.
{xiaoyou}修为同级罕有敌手，即使是我也不是敌手了。¤Even I am no longer an adversary.
{xiaoyou}不必懊恼，你有如此修为已是同龄人中的翘楚了。¤There is no need to be upset, you are already the best of your peers at this level.
劳{xiaoyou}费心了，此礼甚得我心。¤I'm grateful to {xiaoyou} for your kindness.
{item}...{xiaoyou}的赠礼太贵重了，多谢。（可惜我暂时用不上...）¤{item}... Thank you for the gift from {xiaoyou}. （Unfortunately I won't be using it for a while...）
多谢{FirstName}{xiaoyou}，只可惜我暂时用不上{item}¤Thank you {FirstName}{xiaoyou}, but unfortunately I can't use it at the moment {item}
这...{xiaoyou}为何要送我{item}？¤This... Why did {xiaoyou} send me {item}?
{xiaoyou}此举是因为遇到了难以启齿的困境么？那这{item}便让你拿去罢。¤Is {xiaoyou} doing this because he has a difficult problem? Then you can have this {item}.
{friendid}{qianbei}名声在外，我也是久仰多时了。{FirstName}{xiaoyou}既是{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，这{item}便送给你了。¤{friendid}{qianbei} is well-known, and I have heard so much about it for a long time. {First name}{xiaoyou} is both {SpecRel} of {qianbei}, and this {item} will be given to you.
我一再容让，{xiaoyou}却是步步紧逼，那就怪不得我了！¤I have repeatedly made allowances, but {Xiaoyou} has pressed on, so it is not my fault!
呵呵，{FirstName}{xiaoyou}真是与众不同的诙谐。¤The {FirstName}{xiaoyou} is really different witty.
这便是{FirstName}{xiaoyou}想要的{miji}了。¤This is the {miji} that {FirstName}{xiaoyou} wants.
难得与{FirstName}{xiaoyou}一见，还是聊聊这宁州的逸闻趣事吧。¤It's a rare meeting with {FirstName}{xiaoyou}, so let's talk about the interesting stories of Ningzhou.
你我难得一见，还是不聊这枯涩的{miji}吧，莫要扫了{FirstName}{xiaoyou}的雅兴。¤You and I have a rare meeting, so let's not talk about this boring {miji} and not spoil {FirstName}{xiaoyou}'s fun.
我最近在悟道时陷入瓶颈，久坐枯死也无法突破，要是有人能陪我探讨交流一番就好了。不知{xiaoyou}...¤I've recently hit a bottleneck in my enlightenment, and I can't break through even after sitting for a long time, so it would be nice to have someone to talk to. I wonder if {xiaoyou}...
希望我的浅薄学识，可以带给{xiaoyou}些许灵感。¤I hope my superficial knowledge can bring {xiaoyou} some inspiration.
没想到高深天道对{xiaoyou}仅如一湾浅水，唾手可得。¤I didn't realize that the deepest paths of heaven were only a shallow bay of water within reach of {xiaoyou}.
天道高深，悟道非朝夕之事，{xiaoyou}不用气馁。¤It is not a matter of time before one is able to achieve enlightenment, so {xiaoyou} need not be discouraged.
最近要传授弟子战斗经验，但自己修行尚有不足，{xiaoyou}可愿切磋一番？¤I have recently had to teach my Disciple combat experience, but my own training is still lacking, would {xiaoyou} like to have a sparring session?
{xiaoyou}所想正合我心意，以后多多联系。¤{xiaoyou}'s thoughts are exactly what I want, let's get in touch in the future.
我答应你...你啊，真拿{xiaoyou}你没办法，谁让我喜欢你呢。¤I promise you... You, I can't help {xiaoyou} you, who made me like you.
我答应你，{xiaoyou}真是勇气可嘉呢，我也喜欢你很久了哦。¤I promise you, {xiaoyou} is really brave, I've liked you for a long time too.
{xiaoyou}真会说笑。¤I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a good deal on this.
{xiaoyou}，大比重在切磋比试，你我二人点到为止便好。¤{xiaoyou}, the big weight is in the competition.
和{daoyou}一起双修，真是美妙呢，没有伤着你吧，休息一下再来吧~¤It's wonderful to dual cultivate with {daoyou}, it didn't hurt did it, why don't you take a break and come back later~
（对方眉头一皱）...¤（A frown on his face） ...
在下佩服。¤I'm impressed.
哼，{xiaoyou}这是在羞辱我么？¤Is that an insult to me, {xiaoyou}?
{xiaoyou}可有时间交流一番悟道心得？¤Would {xiaoyou} have time to share some enlightenment ideas?
好，很好。¤Yes, very well.
...，无妨。¤... ..., no harm done.
...，找其他人吧。¤... I'll find someone else.
听说，{xiaoyou}很强，我想，见识见识。¤I heard that {xiaoyou} is very strong, I think, see.
{xiaoyou}，请。¤{xiaoyou}, please.
{xiaoyou}，厉害。¤{xiaoyou}, awesome.
{xiaoyou}，承让。¤{xiaoyou}, grant.
这天劫...当真可怖。¤This Tribulation... What a terrifying thing.
再来。¤Again.
哼，下不为例！¤I'm not going to do it again!
可别怪我下手太重。¤Don't blame me for being too hard on you.
哼，浪费我的时间。¤You're wasting my time.
哈哈，{xiaoyou}怎知我急需{item}？真是太及时了，感激不尽！¤Haha, how did {xiaoyou} know I was in desperate need of {item}? That was very timely and I appreciate it!
没想到{xiaoyou}如此大方，连{item}这等宝贝也舍得拿来送人，多谢多谢！¤I didn't expect {xiaoyou} to be so generous as to give away such a treasure as {item}, thank you very much!
就这{item}你也送...算了算了，下次可别拿这种{item}打发我。¤You gave away this {item}... Forget it, next time don't send me this kind of {item}.
原来{FirstName}{xiaoyou}是{friendid}{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，那我就卖{qianbei}个面子，这{item}送你了。¤It turns out that {first name}{xiaoyou} is {specrel} of {friendid}{qianbei}, then I will sell {qianbei} to save face, and this {item} will be given to you.
哦？就这...这么会打趣，不愧是{xiaoyou}，啊{size=28}哈{/size}{size=26}哈{/size}{size=24}哈{/size}{size=22}哈{/size}{size=20}哈{/size}¤Oh? This is... The actual fact is that {xiaoyou} is so good at jokes, ah {size=28}ha{/size}{size=26}ha{/size}{size=24}ha{/size}{size=22}ha{/size}{size=20}ha{/size}
不就{miji}，且听本座道来。¤Not just {miji}, but listen to what I have to say.
这{miji}乃我{shili}立身之本，{FirstName}{xiaoyou}还是打消这个念头吧。¤This {miji} is the basis of my {shili} establishment, {FirstName}{xiaoyou} it is better to dismiss this idea.
我最近悟道陷入瓶颈，{xiaoyou}可愿交流交流？说不定对我也有些新的启发。¤I have recently reached a bottleneck in my enlightenment, would {xiaoyou} like to share? I'm not sure if I'll be able to get any new insights.
哈哈哈，就让我指点指点{xiaoyou}。¤I'll give you some pointers, {xiaoyou}.
哈哈哈，{xiaoyou}悟性不错。¤Hahaha {xiaoyou} has great insight.
不错，不错，{xiaoyou}在小辈中已是出类拔萃了。¤I think {xiaoyou} is already outstanding among the juniors.
下次做好准备再来，真是浪费我时间。¤Next time be prepared to come back, what a waste of my time.
就不该找低境界的人论道，真是浪费时间。¤It's a waste of my time. I shouldn't have sought out people from lower realms to discuss the Tao.
最近闲来无事，手痒得紧，{xiaoyou}快来陪我玩玩。¤I have nothing to do lately and my hands are itching to play, so {xiaoyou} should come and play with me.
好，我也正有此意。以后有时间多指点指点{xiaoyou}哈哈哈。¤I'd like to do the same. I'll have time to give {xiaoyou} more pointers in the future hahaha.
{xiaoyou}可别拿我寻开心了。¤I'm not sure if I'm a good person or not.
{xiaoyou}若是再拿我说笑，头都给你打飞。¤{xiaoyou}If you ever make fun of me again, your head will fly off to you.
{xiaoyou}，我可不会让着你。¤{xiaoyou}, I won't let you.
{xiaoyou}还是多练练再来和我打吧。¤{xiaoyou} still practice more and come back to play with me.
不愧是天地大劫，真了不起啊。¤True to form, the Great Tribulation of Heaven and Earth is truly remarkable.
桀桀，下不为例哦！¤Jie Jie, next time will not be an exception!
既然你自己找死，就别挂我心狠手辣了。¤I'm not going to hang me for being ruthless since you're looking for your own death.
呵呵，{xiaoyou}不必担心，我会留手的。¤The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on the right person.
桀桀，现在的年轻人了不得啊。¤The young people nowadays are amazing.
呦，才这几招就不行了？¤Yo, just a few moves and you can't do it anymore?
我正急需{item}，就不跟{xiaoyou}客气了，相赠之情必不敢忘。¤I'm in desperate need of {item}, so I'm not going to be polite to {xiaoyou}, I won't forget the gift.
{xiaoyou}盛情难却，那我也就不多作推辞了。¤I don't think I'll have to say no more.
这{item}价值之高，我受之有愧。不过既然{xiaoyou}坚持，那我就却之不恭了。¤I'm very grateful for the value of this {item}. But since {xiaoyou} insists, I'll accept it.
{FirstName}{xiaoyou}真是别出心裁，只可惜这{item}我暂时用不上。¤{FirstName}{xiaoyou} is very original, but unfortunately I won't be able to use this {item} for a while.
{friendid}{qianbei}实力之强可谓是闻名遐迩，在下也是爱慕已久。{FirstName}{xiaoyou}既是{friendid}{qianbei}的{SpecRel}，这{item}便有劳给{qianbei}了。¤{friendid}{qianbei}is famous for its strength, and I have long admired it. {First name}{xiaoyou} is both {SpecRel} of {friendid}{qianbei}, and this{item} will be paid to {qianbei}.
{xiaoyou}的交流方式真是特别，不过巧了，我也不是什么软柿子。¤{Xiaoyou} has a very special way of communicating, but coincidentally, I'm not a soft touch either.
哦？这可不是我印象中{friendid}{qianbei}能容忍的行为，{FirstName}{xiaoyou}还是注意点为上。¤Oh? This is not the behavior that {friendid}{qianbei} can tolerate in my impression. {First name}{xiaoyou} should pay attention.
看来{xiaoyou}近来心情甚是不错，竟有时间拿我打趣。¤It seems that {xiaoyou} has been in a good mood lately and has time to make fun of me.
这{miji}虽颇为珍稀，但既然{FirstName}{xiaoyou}开口了，我自然不会拒绝。¤This {miji} is quite rare, but since {FirstName}{xiaoyou} has asked, I naturally won't refuse.
这{miji}我得来不易，怕是不能轻易传授给{FirstName}{xiaoyou}。¤It was not easy for me to get this {miji}, so I'm afraid I can't pass it on to {FirstName}{xiaoyou} easily.
我也想将这{miji}传授于{FirstName}{xiaoyou}，奈何宗门之命难以违抗，见谅。¤I would like to pass on this {miji} to {FirstName}{xiaoyou}, but it is difficult to disobey the orders of the clan, so forgive me.
听闻{xiaoyou}在悟道方面颇有见地，可愿与我探讨一番？¤I have heard that {Xiaoyou} is very knowledgeable in the area of enlightenment, would you like to discuss it with me?
那便让我向{xiaoyou}分享一下我对道的浅薄认识吧。¤Then let me share with {xiaoyou} my humble knowledge of the Dao.
我不过是稍加点拨而已，都是{xiaoyou}自己所悟。¤I'm just giving a few pointers, it's all {xiaoyou}'s own understanding.
不错，不错，{xiaoyou}的悟性甚至超过了我的预期。¤Not bad, not bad, {xiaoyou}'s Comphrension even exceeded my expectations.
看来我今天不在状态，下次再陪{xiaoyou}论道吧。¤I guess I'm not in the mood today, so I'll discuss it with {xiaoyou} next time.
看来我今天不在状态，下次再找{xiaoyou}论道吧。¤It seems that I am not in my element today, let's have a dao discussion with {xiaoyou} next time.
就你这些微末修为，也配与我论道？¤With your meagre cultivation, you are still worthy to discuss the dao with me?
听闻{xiaoyou}同境内战力无双，不知可愿让我见识见识？¤I heard that {xiaoyou} has unparalleled combat power within the same territory, would you like to show me?
我与{xiaoyou}相谈甚欢，也正有以后多多联系之意。还请{xiaoyou}将神识信息留于在下传音符中。¤I've had a good conversation with {xiaoyou}, and I'd like to get in touch with you more in the future. I would also like to ask {xiaoyou} to leave Soul Sense messages in my voice transmission.
桀桀，{xiaoyou}真是了不得啊。¤Jie Jie, {xiaoyou} is really amazing.
嘿嘿，{daoyou}，见识到我的厉害了吧~¤Hahaha，{daoyou}，Do you have a good grasp of my strength now.
{xiaoyou}，下不为例哦！¤I will not make an exception for you, {xiaoyou}!
莫要灰心，我在你这个年纪修为还不如你呢。¤Don't be discouraged, my cultivation is not as good as yours at your age.
请{xiaoyou}谅解，这{miji}我不能传授于你。¤Please {xiaoyou} understand that I cannot pass this {miji} on to you.
即便对手是你，我也是不会留手的。¤Even if the opponent is you, I will not let go.
{xiaoyou}，即便对手是你，我也是不会留手的。¤{xiaoyou}, even if the opponent is you, I will not keep it.
{xiaoyou}，这我就不计较了！¤I'll let it go, {xiaoyou}!
哈哈哈，老骨头不中用了。¤Hahahaha, old bones are not useful anymore.
小小年纪就有如此修为，过些时日我也不是你的对手咯。¤I'm not a match for you even at a young age.
哈哈哈，{xiaoyou}这个玩笑可算不上高明。¤I'm not sure that {xiaoyou}'s joke is very clever.
哈哈哈，我这老骨头不中用了。¤Hahaha, my old bones are useless.
嘿嘿，真过瘾，不过呀，{daoyou}你可得好好修炼才行呢。¤Hehe, That was real fun, But {daoyou} you need to train alot harder.
{xiaoyou}再修练个几千年说不定能赶上我。¤I'm sure you'll be able to catch up with me in a few thousand years of training.
哈哈哈，这天地间能懂我的唯有{FirstName}{xiaoyou}而已！¤The only one who can understand me is {FirstName}{xiaoyou}!
呵，拿走吧。修仙艰难，{xiaoyou}可要当心别碰着什么意外，就这么陨落了。¤Take it away. Cultivation of immortality is difficult, {Xiaoyou} must be careful not to meet with any accidents and die like this.
会一点微末之技就想发不义之财？要不是我今天心情好，倒要教训教训你！¤You want to make an unjust fortune just because you know a little bit of a skill? If I wasn't in a good mood today, I'd teach you a lesson!
{xiaoyou}是在尝试用如此拙劣的手法逗我笑？哈，哈，哈。¤I'm not sure if this is a good idea. Ha, ha, ha.
既然{xiaoyou}有幸碰到我不忙，便指点你一番吧。¤Since {xiaoyou} is lucky enough to come across me not being busy, I'll give you some pointers.
哼，比想象中的容易一点。别误会了，本座说的是指点你。¤Hmph, it's a little easier than one might think. Don't get me wrong, what this seat is talking about is instructing you.
勉强合格吧，作为一个晚辈不算太差。¤It's barely passable, not too bad as a late bloomer.
哼，朽木难雕。¤Hmph, rotten wood is hard to carve.
哼，浪费时间。¤Hmph, a waste of time.
就你这些微末修为，也配与本座论道？¤How can you be worthy of discussing the dao with this throne with such a meagre cultivation?
好，{FirstName}{xiaoyou}与那些废物不同，有资格与我联系。¤Good, {FirstName}{xiaoyou} is different from those wastes and is qualified to contact me.
哼，就算是便宜你了。日后若敢负了我，定要你生不如死！¤Hmph, even if it's cheap for you. If you dare to fail me in the future, you will definitely be better off dead!
{xiaoyou}，你放心，我会手下留情的。¤{xiaoyou}, don't worry, I will be merciful.
什么？难道我现在不好看嘛...哼，也不是不行啦，让我来看看吧。¤What? Don't tell me I look like shit right now, ...This isn't too terrible, come give me a quick look.
看在{xiaoyou}送礼颇丰的情分上，此次就当无事发生。¤I'm not going to be able to get you to the right place.
既然你硬要送上门来，我便不客气了！¤But since you insisted on coming to me, I'm not going to be polite!
要是受了伤可别来讹我。¤If you get hurt don't come and blackmail me.
停停停，你怎么能偷袭我一个老前辈。¤Stop stop stop, how can you sneak up on an old-timer like me.
{xiaoyou}实力不错，无需气馁。¤{Xiaoyou} You have good strength, no need to be discouraged.
{item}！{xiaoyou}与我交情如此之好，我就不作推辞了，嘿嘿。¤{item}! {xiaoyou}I'm so good friends with me, I won't be a pushover, hehehe.
嘶...这{item}可是相当值钱的宝贝，{xiaoyou}有心了。¤Heh... This {item} is quite a valuable treasure, {xiaoyou} has a heart.
这话题真无聊，还是聊聊{xiaoyou}最近又在机缘中获得了什么宝贝吧。¤This is a boring topic, let's talk about what {xiaoyou} has recently acquired by chance.
嘿嘿，{xiaoyou}想学{miji}的话，是不是该意思意思。¤Hey, if {xiaoyou} wants to learn {miji}, shouldn't he mean it.
{FirstName}{xiaoyou}，{miji}乃我派立身之本，怕是不能轻易教你。¤{FirstName}{xiaoyou}, {miji} is the foundation of my school, so I'm afraid I can't teach you easily.
我最近在修炼中遇到了一些瓶颈，枯坐闭关已然无用。不知{xiaoyou}可否愿意与我交流一二，或许对我也会有些新的启发。¤I have recently encountered some bottlenecks in my cultivation, and sitting in seclusion is no longer useful. I wonder if {xiaoyou} would be willing to share a few things with me, perhaps it would also give me some new inspiration.
看在{xiaoyou}与我关系不错的份上，便指点你一番吧。¤I'd like to give you some pointers because {xiaoyou} and I have a good relationship.
{xiaoyou}悟性不错嘛，本座都羡慕了。¤{xiaoyou} is quite insightful, we are impressed.
唉，浪费不少时间，亏了亏了。¤I've wasted a lot of time, I've lost a lot of time.
唉，真是浪费时间，亏了亏了。¤I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that.
想听本座讲道，{xiaoyou}是不是该意思意思？¤If you want to listen to my sermon, shouldn't {xiaoyou} be able to show me what you mean?
我最近新得一件法宝，{xiaoyou}可有空陪我磨合一番？¤I've recently acquired a new magic treasure, would {xiaoyou} be free to spend some time with me?
太好了，我也正有此意。{xiaoyou}若是有机缘，别忘了叫上我嘿嘿。¤That's great, I'd like to do that too. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that, but I'm not going to be able to do that.
{xiaoyou}的财...哦不，性格深得我心，很高兴能与{xiaoyou}结缘。¤{xiaoyou}'s fortune... I'm glad to be associated with {xiaoyou}.
看在{xiaoyou}送礼颇丰的份上，此次就当无事发生。¤I'm glad to see that {xiaoyou} has given me a lot of gifts, so I'll just pretend that nothing happened this time.
自己注意着点，要是受了伤可别来讹我。¤Pay attention to yourself, don't blackmail me if you are injured.
呵呵，以为师之见，徒儿还是直接认输为好，莫要伤了和气。¤Hehe, I thought it was better for the disciple to admit defeat directly, not to hurt the peace.
竟如此不念师徒情谊？嘁，真是枉费师徒一场。¤Why don't you miss the friendship between master and apprentice? What a waste of mentoring and apprenticeship.
哈哈哈哈，承让承让。¤Hahahaha, give and take.
{xiaoyou}，你自己注意着点，受了伤可别赖我。¤{xiaoyou}, you take care of yourself, don't blame me if you get hurt.
哼，大胆！¤How dare you!
请{xiaoyou}指点。¤I'd like {xiaoyou} to show me the way.
真是不知所谓。¤You don't know what you're doing.
和{xiaoyou}结缘于我亦有好处，可以。¤I'm not sure if it's a good idea for me to be associated with {xiaoyou}.
{xiaoyou}莫非是认为戏弄我很有意思？¤I'm not sure if {xiaoyou} thinks it's funny to tease me?
{daoyou}，你不行啊，嘿嘿，看我的~¤{daoyou}，Looks like you don't have what it takes, hehe now watch this~
（对方面色不善的盯着你）¤（The opponent is staring at you with a scowl）
哼，让你一招。¤Hmph, I'll give you a move.
大胆！敢在我面前动手脚？¤How dare you! How dare you make a move in front of me?
啊？{xiaoyou}是故意来浪费我时间的？¤Huh? {xiaoyou} came here on purpose to waste my time?

算了，后面也许还有更值得我出手的物件儿。¤I don't want to be a part of it, but there might be something more worthwhile for me to do.
本就是试试水而已，我不与你抢了。¤I'm not going to steal it from you.
算了算了，我不与你抢了。¤I'm not going to fight you.
倒也不是非得买下此物。¤It's not that I have to buy it.
这种东西也有人抢？¤How can someone steal something like this?
此人加价如此激进，莫非此物还别有玄机？¤This person is so aggressive in raising the price, could it be that there is something more to this item?
是我看走眼了么？¤Have I misjudged it?
若是能用合适的价格买下，倒也不错。¤It would be good if I could buy it at the right price.
争抢如此激烈，此物定有玄妙之处。¤The bidding is so fierce, there must be something mysterious about this object.
此物竞价如此激烈，再参与下去也无甚意义了。¤The bidding is so fierce that there is no point in participating any longer.
没想到竞价居然如此激烈...罢了，看来此物与我无缘。¤I didn't expect the bidding to be so fierce... I guess this item is not destined for me.
这价格...也差不多该收手了。¤This price... It's about time to call it quits.
可惜...若能拍下此物倒也不错。¤It's a shame... It would have been nice if I could have won this item.
这竞价居然涨的这么快...我还是再观望观望吧...¤The bidding has gone up so quickly... I'd better wait and see...
此人出手倒是魄力不凡，这会场里还真是藏龙卧虎啊。¤This man has made a very bold bid, and there is a hidden tiger in this venue.
不必急于这一时出手。¤There's no need to rush into this.
哦?看来此物另有玄妙。¤Oh? It seems there's something more to this.
有意思，我倒要看看谁能从我手里拿下此物。¤Interesting, I'd like to see who can take it from me.
唉，我剩下的灵石也不多了...看来此物与我无缘啊。¤Alas, I don't have many spirit stones left... I don't think it's my fate.
真是个疯子，这般胡乱出价，与这种人比价也忒不划算。¤What a madman, bidding so carelessly, it's not a good deal to compete with such a person.

炼丹¤Alchemy
<Title>炼丹</Title>\n<Image>liandan_1</Image>\n在炼丹界面中会显示所有已解锁的丹方，若已经收集齐了此丹方所需材料，则可以一键放入材料开始炼丹。\n即便没有丹方，也可以直接在丹炉中放入草药进行炼制。若草药的药性和配比满足成丹的需求，一样可以炼制成功。\n\n<Title>丹方</Title>\n购买丹方并在背包中右键使用，便可以学会对应丹药的炼制方式。\n首次使用新的配方炼制丹药成功后，此丹方也会被保存记录下来。\n\n<Title>丹炉</Title>\n<Image>liandan_2</Image>\n炼制丹药前需先放入丹炉。\n炼丹无论成功或失败，都会损耗丹炉的耐久。\n当丹炉耐久清零时，不仅此番炼丹会失败，还会受到炸炉的伤害。\n炼制越高品阶的丹药，对丹炉耐久的损耗也越大。选择高品阶的丹炉可以大幅降低炼丹时丹炉耐久的损耗。\n\n<Title>丹方推理</Title>\n无论丹药炼制是否成功，都可以通过丹药炼制的结果推理或优化丹方。\n<Image>liandan_3</Image>\n若丹药炼制成功，但还有多余的药渣，则说明有对应的药力过剩，可以考虑减少对应草药的用量，或降低草药的品阶。\n<Image>liandan_4</Image>\n若丹药炼制成废丹，则说明主药与辅药的组合正确可以成丹，但药引的寒热属性错误，未能中和药性。可以通过更改药引的方式重新炼丹。¤<Title> Alchemy</Title>\n<Image>liandan_1</Image>\n All unlocked dan recipes will be displayed in the alchemy interface. If you have collected the materials required for this alchemy, you can put the materials in with one click to start alchemy.\n Even if there is no pill, you can directly put herbs in the pill furnace for refining. If the medicinal properties and ratio of herbal medicines  If the herbs' properties and ratios meet they can be successfully refined.\n\n<Title> Pill </Title>\n Buy pill and use it with the right button in the backpack, you can learn the refining method of the corresponding pill.\n After the first use of the new formula to refine the pill is successful, this pill will also be kept and recorded.\n\n<Title>Pill furnace </Title>\n<Image>liandan_2</Image>\n You need to put it in the pill furnace before refining the pill.\n Whether alchemy succeeds or fails, it will consume the durability of the Dan furnace.\n When the durability of the Dan furnace is cleared to zero, not only will this alchemy fail, but it will also be damaged by the furnace.\n The higher the grade of pill refined, the greater the loss to the durability of the pill furnace. Choosing a high-grade Dan furnace can greatly reduce the durability loss of the Dan furnace during alchemy.\n\n<Title> Danfang Reasoning </Title>\n Regardless of whether the refining of medicine pill is successful or not, the pill recipes can be inferred or optimized through the results of the refining of pills.\n<Image>liandan_3</Image>\n If the pill is successfully refined, but there is still excess residue, it means that there is a corresponding excess medicinal power. You can consider reducing the amount of the corresponding herbal medicine or reducing the grade of the herbal medicine. \n<Image>liandan_4</Image>\n If the pill is refined into a waste pill, it means that the combination of the main medicine and the adjuvant medicine is correct to form a pill, but the cold and heat properties of the medicine are wrong and the medicinal properties cannot be neutralized.Alchemy can be re-refined by changing the medicine introduction.
<Title>选择器型</Title>\n<Image>lianqi_1</Image>\n炼器的第一步是选择这次想要炼制的法宝。\n不同型制的法宝都有自己特殊的作用，反映在炼器之上，就是同样的材料如果炼制成不同的法宝，也会有不同的效果。\n\n<Title>准备材料</Title>\n<Image>lianqi_2</Image>\n炼器自然需要准备炼器的材料。\n炼器的材料除了品阶外有两个状态，分别为它的种类和属性。\n种类分别为金属、石、牙骨、皮鳞、灵武，这些种类决定了这个材料的“韧性、坚固、亲和、灵性和操控”，我们称之为五维。\n而属性分别有“金木水火土气神剑”，在这其中又再分了阴阳，不同属性的材料会给法宝带来不同的效果。\n\n<Title>放入材料</Title>\n<Image>lianqi_3</Image>\n炼制一件法宝需要消耗10件材料，通过点击对应的槽位就可以添加材料。\n\n<Title>关注五维</Title>\n<Image>lianqi_4</Image>\n在放入材料的同时，我们可以看到左边的初始灵气和五维都在不断增长。\n材料的品阶决定了材料的灵气值。\n材料的种类决定了材料的五维，当我们看到总灵力小于初始灵力时，说明了此时五维的属性不平衡，材料的部分灵力被浪费在平衡五维上。\n所以放置材料时首先要关注的就是五维的平衡，确保能最大化地利用材料的灵力。\n通常而言，五维的上限是500，而若是五维之和超过2200，那么就不会有灵力被浪费。\n\n<Title>选择灵纹</Title>\n<Image>lianqi_5</Image>\n最后一步，你可以选择你已经获得的大道天赋中的炼器灵纹对法宝进行加强。\n通常这些灵纹会增加灵力的数量，但也会对使用者有更高的要求或是会对使用者产生负面效果。¤<Title>Selector type</Title>\n<Image>lianqi_1</Image>\n The first step of the refiner is to choose the magic weapon you want to refine this time.\n Different types of magic weapons have their own special effects, which are reflected in the refining device, that is, if the same material is refined into different magic weapons, it will have different effects.\n\n<Title> Preparation materials </Title>\n<Image>lianqi_2</Image>\n The refiner naturally needs to prepare the materials for the refiner.\n The material of the refiner has two states in addition to the grade, namely its type and attributes.\n The types are metal, stone, tooth bone, skin scale, and Lingwu. These types determine the “toughness, firmness, affinity, spirituality, and manipulation” of this material. We call it the five dimensions.\n And the attributes are “metal, wood, water, fire, earth, qi, divine, sword'', in which yin and yang are divided, and materials with different attributes will bring different effects to the magic weapon.\n\n<Title> Put the material </Title>\n<Image>lianqi_3</Image>\n Refining a magic weapon requires 10 pieces of material, you can add the material by clicking on the corresponding slot.\n\n<Title> Pay attention to the five dimensions </Title>\n<Image>lianqi_4</Image>\n While putting the material, we can see that the initial aura and the five dimensions on the left are constantly growing.\n The grade of the material determines the aura value of the material.\n The type of material determines the five dimensions of the material. When we see that the total spiritual power is less than the initial spiritual power, it shows that the attributes of the five dimensions are unbalanced at this time, and part of the material's spiritual power is wasted on balancing the five dimensions. \n Therefore, the first thing to pay attention to when placing materials is the five-dimensional balance to ensure that the spiritual power of the materials can be maximized.\n Generally speaking, the upper limit of the five dimensions is 500, and if the sum of the five dimensions exceeds 2200, then no spiritual power will be wasted.\n\n<Title> Select Spirit pattern </Title>\n<Image>lianqi_5</Image>\n In the last step, you can choose the refining spirit pattern in the Dao talent you have acquired to strengthen the magic weapon.\n Usually these spiritual patterns will increase the amount of spiritual power, but they will also have higher requirements for the user or will have a negative effect on the user.
<Title>灵感</Title>\n灵感：灵感是论道时的重要状态，论道时会根据你的灵感状态消耗灵感，并对论道结果进行加成，灵感的积累速度为每个月增加1点，每次小境界突破增加50点，每次大境界突破增加100点。灵感的上限由心境决定，心境越高，灵感的上限越高。\n\n灵感小于20\n灵思枯竭：双方悟道值的获取减少100%，悟道经验减少50%，每次论道灵感清零。\n灵感大于20\n心无波澜：双方悟道经验和悟道值正常获取，每次论道消耗20点灵感。\n灵感大于40\n灵光闪现：双方悟道经验的获取增加100%，每次论道消耗40点灵感。\n灵感大于80\n天人感应：双方悟道经验和悟道值的获取增加300%，每次论道消耗80点灵感。\n\n<Title>论道的选题</Title>\n<Image>lundao_2</Image>\n论道开始时可以选择论题。\n通常来说，选择论题的双方悟道境界越高，选择的论题越多，论道的难度越高。\n但同时，悟道境界越高，论题越多，论道获得的收益也就越多。\n\n<Title>论道</Title>\n<Image>lundao_3</Image>\n可以看到，论道时会依据你选择的论题提供目标，同时你也会获得与论题相对应的论点牌。\n论点牌有等级之分，与你对应的悟道境界相关，悟道境界越高，就能获得等级越高的论点。\n论道时，双方提出的相同属性、相同等级的论点会碰撞形成一个更高一级的论点，不断地碰撞论点，满足上方的论题目标，就能完成相应的论题，获得对应等级的思绪。\n<Image>lundao4</Image>\n\n<Title>论道收获</Title>\n<Image>lundao_5</Image>\n只要完成任意一个论题，论道就可以认为是成功的，论道成功后，会根据你完成的论题，提供给你相应的思绪，此时，论题要求的论点等级越高，思绪的品阶和获得的悟道经验也会越高。\n而同时，你们双方在论道时论点的碰撞会不断地积累悟道值，碰撞的论点等级越高，获得的悟道值也就越高，当悟道值积累到一定程度后，就可以获得悟道点。\n通过论道，最多可获得30点悟道点。¤<Title>Inspiration</Title> \nInspiration: Inspiration is an important state when discussing Dao. Discussion's will consume inspiration according to your inspiration state and add to the result of the discussion. The accumulation rate of inspiration increases by 1 point per month, 50 points for minor realm breakthrough, and 100 points for major realm breakthrough. The upper limit of inspiration is determined by the state of mind, the higher the state of mind, the higher the upper limit of inspiration. \n\nInspiration less than 20 \nUninspired:both sides enlightenment value is reduced by 100%, the enlightenment experience is reduced by 50%, and the inspiration returns to 0 for each argument. \nInspiration greater than 20\nTranquil: Both sides get normal enlightenment experience and enlightenment value, and consume 20 points of inspiration each discussion. \nInspiration greater than 40\nBrilliance: both sides enlightenment experience increased by 100%, each argument consumes 40 points of inspiration. \nInspiration greater than 80\nCelestial inspiration: both sides' enlightenment experience and enlightenment value increases by 300%, and each discussion consumes 80 points of inspiration. \n\n<Title>Selecting topics for the Discourse</Title>\n<Image>lundao_2</Image>\nYou can choose the topic of the Discourse at the beginning of the Discourse. \nUsually, the higher the realm of enlightenment of the two parties choosing the thesis topic, the more thesis topics are chosen, and the more difficult the thesis is. \nBut at the same time, the higher the realm of enlightenment, the more thesis topics, and the more gains. \n\n<Title>On the Way</Title>\n<Image>lundao_3</Image>\nYou can see which Dao will be provided based on the thesis you choose, and you will also get the argument tiles corresponding to the thesis. \nThe argument tiles are graded according to your corresponding realm of enlightenment; the higher the realm of enlightenment, the higher the grade of argument you will receive. \nWhen arguing, arguments with the same attributes and the same rank presented by both sides will collide to form a higher ranked argument. Keep colliding arguments to meet the argument goal above, you will be able to complete the corresponding argument and get the corresponding level of thought. \n<Image>lundao4</Image>\n<Title>Thesis Reward</Title>\n<Image>lundao_5</Image>\nAs long as you complete any of the theses, the thesis can be considered successful, after you will be provided with the corresponding topic you completed, The higher the grade of the argument, the higher enlightenment experience gained will be. \nAt the same time, the collision of your arguments during the argument will continuously accumulate the enlightenment value. The higher the grade of the colliding arguments, the higher the enlightenment value obtained, and when the enlightenment value accumulates to a certain level, you will be able to obtain enlightenment points. \nThrough the argument, you can get up to 30 enlightenment points.

<Title>结丹</Title>\n突破筑基时，你将进入入定的状态。在九回合内完成【三花聚顶】，【五气朝元】，并在【凝液成丹】阶段至少凝聚一次五行源灵气，即可成功突破。\n所有辅助突破的丹药需在结丹开始前突破，过早服用将失效。\n<Image>jiedan_1</Image>\n<Title>丹分九品</Title>\n在【凝液成丹】阶段，凝聚的五行源灵气越多，金丹品阶越高，五行灵气的属性比例也将影响最终成丹的属性。\n金丹的品阶越高，提升的修炼速度与属性也越高。若结成八品或九品金丹，还将额外提升战斗时的初始灵气牌数量。\n<Image>jiedan_2</Image>¤<Title>Termination</Title>\nWhen you break through the foundation building, you will enter the state of entering. You can successfully break through by completing 【Three Flowers Ascension】, 【Five Qi Consolidation】 within nine rounds and condensing five elements of source Qi at least once during the 【Core Condensation】 stage. \nAll Pills that assist in breakthrough need to be broken through before the start of dan formation and will be invalid if taken too early. \n<Image>jiedan_1</Image>\n<Title>Dan is divided into nine grades</Title>\nThe more five elements of source Qi are condensed at the 【condensing liquid into a dan】 stage, the higher the grade of the golden dan, and the ratio of the attributes of the five elements of Qi will also affect the attributes of the final formed dan. The higher the grade of the \n golden pellet, the higher the enhanced cultivation speed and attributes. If the eighth or ninth grade Golden Core is formed, it will also additionally enhance the number of initial Qi tiles during battle. \n<Image>jiedan_2</Image>
<Title>化婴</Title>\n<Image>jieying_1</Image>\n化婴需经过【碎丹】与【化婴】两个阶段。在【意志】或【经脉】属性降低到0以前，完成【化婴】，即可成功突破。\n在化婴前学习的秘术可以在此时进行使用，它们能大幅提高你化婴成功的几率。\n在【化婴】阶段，你将受到“心魔”的考验。是选择在意志溃散前强行化婴，还是坚持到心魔消散，全看你自己的选择。\n<Image>jieying_2</Image>\n<Title>意志</Title>\n【意志】受【心境】与【神道】感悟影响，【心境】与【神道】感悟越高，【意志】上限越高\n当【意志】低于50时，玩家受到的心魔伤害将提升20%\n当【意志】归0时，化婴失败，化婴者将身死道消\n<Title>经脉</Title>\n【经脉】受【体道】与【气道】感悟影响，【体道】与【气道】感悟越高，【经脉】上限越高\n当【经脉】血量低于50时，每回合抽牌数-2\n当【经脉】归0时，化婴失败，化婴者将修为大退，但下次化婴时，【经脉】上限+5\n<Title>突破成功</Title>\n突破成功后，金丹提供的血量上限与修炼速度加成翻倍。\n元婴能够额外修炼一本功法，并根据功法的品阶与属性不同，额外获得新的特性。¤<Title>Nascent Transformation</Title>\n<Image>jieying_1</Image>\n Nascent Transformation needs to go through two stages: 【Dan Shattering】 and 【Nascent Transformation】. Before the 【Will】 or 【Meridian】 attribute is reduced to 0, complete the 【Infant Transformation】 to successfully break through. \n The secret techniques you learn before Nascent transformation can be used at this time, and they can significantly increase your chances of successful Nascent transformation. \n During the Nascent Transformation stage, you will be tested by the 'Heart demon'. It is up to you whether you choose to forcibly transform into an Nascent Soul before your will breaks, or to hold on until the demon dissipates. \n<Image>jieying_2</Image>\n<Title>Will</Title>\n 【Will】 is affected by 【Mental State】 and 【soul sense Dao】 perception, the higher the 【Mental State】 and 【soul sense Dao】 perception, the higher the upper limit of 【Will】\n When 【Will】 falls below 50, the player will receive 20% more damage from the Heart demon. \n When 【Will】 goes to 0, Nascent transformation fails. The higher the 【Body Dao】 and 【Qi Dao】 perceptions are, the higher the 【Meridian】 cap is. \n When 【Meridian】 HP falls below 50, the player will draw -2 qi per turn \n When 【Meridian】 returns to 0, the Nascent transformation fails and the Nascent transformer will suffer a major decline in cultivation, but the next time they transform, the 【Meridian】 cap +5\n <Title>Breakthrough Success</Title>\n After a successful breakthrough, the blood cap and cultivation speed bonus provided by the Golden Core are doubled. \n The Nascent Soul is able to cultivate an additional gong method and gain additional new characteristics depending on the gong method's rank and attributes.
<Title>化神</Title>\n<Image>huashen_1</Image>\n除“丹”“器”之外，至少一条大道的感悟达到大道已成时，方可突破化神。\n选择不同的大道，突破后可开启不同效果的化神领域，也会在突破时获得不同的增益效果。\n<Image>huashen_2</Image>\n化神时，若【凡性】达到100，则化神失败，修为大损。反之，若在此之前【仙性】达到100，则化神成功。\n【凡性】每回合将自动提升，且提升速度随回合数递增。\n<Title>凡体</Title>\n【凡体】状态下，每回合结束时【凡性】+4\n<Title>仙胎</Title>\n【仙胎】状态下，每回合结束时【仙性】+4。但处于此状态下时将跳过吸收灵气阶段。¤<Title>Deity Transformation</Title>\n<Image>huashen_1</Image>\n Except for “Dan” Dao, only when the perception of at least one Dao reaches the completion of the avenue can it break through the Deity Transformation. \n Choose different avenues. After breaking through, you can activate Domain of Deity Transformation with different effects, and you will also get different gain effects when breaking through. \n<Image>huashen_2</Image>\n During Deity Transformation, if 【mortal】 reaches 100, the Deity Transformation will fail and the cultivation will be severely damaged. Conversely, if 【immortality】 reaches 100 before this, the Deity Transformation will be successful. \n 【Mortal】 Each round will be automatically increased, and the increase speed will increase with the number of rounds. \n<Title>Mortal body </Title>\n 【Mortal Body】 state, 【Mortal】 +4 at the end of each round\n<Title>Immortal tire </Title>\n 【Immortal tire】 state, 【immortal】 +4 at the end of each round. However, when in this state, the stage of Qi absorption will be skipped.
<Title>渡劫</Title>\n<Image>dujie_1</Image>\n雷劫分为蓄力回合与攻击回合，雷劫名称右侧的数字是下回合它即将对你造成的伤害。\n在雷劫蓄力回合攻击雷劫，可以削弱此伤害，或者也可以通过护罩抵挡这次伤害。\n将鼠标移动至雷劫名称左侧的问号处，可以查看此雷劫详细的额外效果。\n雷劫共有九道，抗住全部九道雷劫且未死亡时，渡劫成功。¤<Title>Overcome</Title>\n<Image>dujie_1</Image>\nLightning Tribulation is divided into two rounds Charging and Striking, the number to the right will be the damage dealt to you in the next turn。\nStriking the tribulation while its charging will reduce damage, or you can use Shield to resist the damage。\nMove the mouse to the question mark to the left of the name of the Lightning tribulation, to view the additional effects of this Lightning Tribulation. \nThere are 9 Tribulations in total, If you resist all nine Tribulations without dying, you will have succeeded.
