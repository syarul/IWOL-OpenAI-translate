我现在要离开这里么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Am I leaving here now? {w}{w=0.5}
这上古龙宫似乎还有未探明的地方。¤This Ancient Dragon Palace seems to have unexplored places.
你运起幽炎决，眼前的火墙露出一个缺口。¤You use the Youyan Jue, and there is a gap in the fire wall in front of you.
眼前是一面火墙，触之甚至可以灼伤神魂。¤There is a wall of fire in front of you, touching it can even burn the soul.
目前此处似乎不能过去，先去别的地方看看吧。¤It doesn't seem to be able to pass here at the moment, let's look elsewhere first.
要进去吗？¤Want to go in?
眼前的废墟之上，一股怨气凝而不散。¤Above the ruins in front of him, a wave of resentment condensed and did not dissipate.
这上古战场虽是凶险，却也暗藏不少宝贝。¤Although this ancient battlefield is dangerous, it also hides many treasures.
眼前是一片废墟瓦砾，即使到了今天也依旧诉说着当年战况的惨烈。¤In front of him is a pile of rubble and rubble, and even today, it still tells the tragic situation of the war.
要前往龙脉之内吗？¤Are you going to the inside of the dragon veins?
御~水~台~¤Royal~Water~Platform~
这里便是上古龙宫吧，真不愧是龙族啊，{xiaozi}你看那边的五龙戏珠。¤This is the Ancient Dragon Palace, it really deserves to be a dragon family, {xiaozi}, look at the five dragons playing pearls over there.
映入眼帘的是一个残破的雕像，感受不到什么灵气了。¤What caught my eye was a broken statue, and I couldn't feel any aura.
这是？¤This is?
等等这金木水火土五龙，各是使用庚金、牙木铁、万载火铜精等四品材料炼制而成，这个用量做个百十把上品法宝都不在话下了吧。¤Wait, these gold, wood, water, fire, soil, and five dragons are each made from four-grade materials such as Gengjin, Yamu, Iron, and Wanzai Fire Copper.
中间那颗珠子？...霍~好大一颗万载冰心石啊，这用来炼器至少得是十份的量了吧。¤The bead in the middle? Huo~ What a huge ice heart stone of ten thousand years, it must be at least ten parts for refining.
这不是普通雕塑，这是一座依托于灵脉的巨型聚灵阵，而其中冰心石更是能平心静气在修炼时防止走火入魔。¤This is not an ordinary sculpture, this is a giant spirit gathering array that relies on the spiritual veins, and the Bingxin Stone among them can calm the mind and prevent it from going crazy during cultivation.
传闻上古时期，龙族乃海中霸主，水中万族来朝，可以想象当年这里成千上万妖族修炼的场景了。¤It is rumored that in ancient times, the dragon clan was the hegemon in the sea, and all clans in the water came to court. It is conceivable that thousands of demon clans practiced here in those days.
虽然这阵法早就毁了，但是你凭借你在器道的造诣完全可以凝练出其中材料。¤Although this formation was destroyed long ago, you can fully condense the materials in it with your attainment in the Dao of Weapons.
唉，这阵法早就毁了，这些材料也在时间流逝中灵力尽失宛若废铁。¤Alas, this formation has long been destroyed, and these materials have also lost their spiritual power in the passage of time, just like scrap metal.
只见五龙雕塑和那颗灵珠，在你真火的包裹之中不断缩小。¤I saw the five dragon sculptures and the spiritual bead, shrinking in the envelope of your real fire.
嗯。¤Ok.
进去看看吧，小心点啊，这上古龙宫今日重见天日，不知有何危险，你自己小心。¤Go in and take a look, be careful, this Ancient Dragon Palace is seeing the sun again today, I don't know what the danger is, be careful yourself.
路过广场，继续向着深处进发，周围的残垣断壁缓缓后退，无不诉说着龙族曾经的辉煌。¤Passing through the square and continuing to move towards the depths, the surrounding ruins and broken walls slowly retreated, all telling the glory of the Dragon Clan.
立于脚边的是一个破败的石碑，上面的字迹极难辨认。¤Standing beside his feet was a dilapidated stone tablet, the writing on it was extremely difficult to read.
眼前一座破败的建筑，旁边有一座石碑，上书乾龙阁三个大字。¤In front of a dilapidated building, there is a stone tablet next to it, with three characters written on it.
乾龙阁...嗯....我若是没有记错的话，这乾龙阁应是上古龙族的秘法库。¤Qianlong Pavilion... um.... If I remember correctly, this Qianlong Pavilion should be the secret magic library of the ancient dragons.
唉~不过，这上古龙宫历经变故，又在海底沉寂了这么久，哪儿还能剩下什么？¤Alas~ However, this Ancient Dragon Palace has gone through changes and has been silent on the seabed for so long, where can there be anything left?
果不其然，没有什么收获啊，这些垃圾还不如刚才广场上的那些呢。¤Sure enough, there is nothing to gain, these garbage are not as good as those in the square just now.
眼前尽是废墟。¤There are ruins in front of you.
移步换景，你进入那破败的阁楼之中。¤Step by step to change the scene, you enter the dilapidated attic.
话音未落突然，天空中出现巨兽虚影。¤Suddenly, before the voice fell, a giant beast phantom appeared in the sky.
吾乃龙族传功长老九玄。¤I am Jiuxuan, the Instructor Elder of the Dragon Clan.
来人可是我族供奉？现在是何时？来跟我说说现在我族近况如何？¤The person who comes is my family's guest elder? When is it now? Come and tell me how my family is doing now?
来人可是我族后裔？现在是何时？来跟我说说现在族中近况如何？¤Is the person here a descendant of my clan? When is it now? Can you tell me how the family is doing now?
你将自上古之战后龙族近况一一道来。¤You will come here one by one with the latest developments of the dragon race since the War of the Ancients.
这么说，鲲族余孽依旧滋扰我族。¤That being said, the remnants of the Kun clan still harass our clan.
可恨！！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤hateful! ! ! {vpunch=10,0.5}
没错。¤Yes.
（这缕残魂不同于之前所见，似乎还保有灵智。）¤(This remnant of the soul is different from what has been seen before, and it seems that it still retains its intelligence.)
活？算是吧，我借助龙脉之力，将自己封印陷入沉睡，方才能苟活至今。¤live? Well, I use the power of the dragon veins to seal myself into a deep sleep, so that I can live to this day.
敢问前辈是如何活到现在的。¤Dare to ask how the seniors lived to the present.
只见天空中的虚影淡了几分，你能感受到眼前的残魂已是油尽灯枯。¤I saw the phantom in the sky faded a bit, and you could feel that the remnant soul in front of you was exhausted.
哈哈，看来我已经没有时间了。¤Haha, looks like I'm running out of time.
说罢，一只玉玺出现在你面前。¤After all, a jade seal appeared in front of you.
这九龙玺是龙皇象征，小友定要带出去交给当代龙皇。¤This Nine Dragon Seal is the symbol of the Dragon Emperor, and the little friend must take it out and hand it over to the contemporary Dragon Emperor.
不过我九玄可不会让小友白跑一趟，这《幽炎诀》乃我本人自创的控火法门这就传授与你。¤But I, Jiu Xuan, won't let my little friend run for nothing. This Secret Flame Art is my own fire control method, so I will teach it to you.
那虚影之中飞出一道光球直奔你眉心。¤A ball of light flew out of the phantom and went straight to your eyebrows.
哈哈哈哈，学了我这《幽炎诀》，小友可定要去引雷池看看啊。¤Hahahaha, after learning my Secret Flame Art, you can definitely go to the Lightning Pool to see it.
兄长我来了。小友切记，切记大仇不可忘，传承不可断。¤Brother, here I come. Little friends, remember, remember that the great feud cannot be forgotten, and the inheritance cannot be interrupted.
随着一声声爽朗的笑声，眼前的残魂消散于空中。¤With a hearty laughter, the remnant in front of him dissipated into the air.
走吧，仙途漫漫，长生难求。没什么好感慨的。¤Let's go, the journey to immortality is long, and longevity is hard to find. Nothing to feel good about.
我竟完全没有发现这残魂的存在？？！！¤I didn't realize the existence of this remnant at all? ? ! !
你收起震惊将自上古之战后龙族近况一一道来。¤You put away the shock and will come to the latest situation of the dragon race since the ancient war.
皇龙殿？这里就是议事大殿了吧。¤Emperor Dragon Palace? This is the conference hall.
嗯，看情形这龙宫大殿自上古一战之中已经毁灭了。¤Well, it looks like this Dragon Palace hall has been destroyed since the ancient war.
眼前数具巨大龙尸与鲲尸匐于废墟之上。¤There are several huge dragon corpses and kun corpses lying on the ruins in front of them.
是啊，上古鲲龙之战堪称惨烈啊。¤Yes, the battle of the ancient Kunlong can be called tragic.
这几具尸体从能量波动看来生前都是元婴强者啊。¤From the energy fluctuations, it seems that these corpses were all Nascent Soul powerhouses during their lifetimes.
不过，此地作为上古战场，应是极阴大凶之地，有渊血冥花、厉魂血珀的宝物产出。¤However, as an ancient battlefield, this place should be an extremely yin and fierce place, and there are treasures of Yuanxueminghua and Lixunxuebao.
吼~~¤Roar~~
“轰~轰~~”¤Boom~Boom~
只见一只鲲向你冲来。¤I saw a kun rushing towards you.
你感受到其中阵阵能量波动传出，似是有人在轰击禁制。¤You feel the bursts of energy fluctuations coming out, it seems that someone is bombarding the ban.
进入楼中，眼前尽是废墟，大量法宝残片与流矢灵力的法宝躺在地上。¤Entering the building, there are ruins in front of you, and a large number of fragments of magic treasures and magic treasures with flowing arrows are lying on the ground.
你感受到，九龙玺似有感应轻轻颤动。¤You feel that the Jiulongxi seems to be shaking slightly.
眼前的空间泛起波纹，裂开一道光门。¤The space in front of him rippled, cracking a door of light.
我还是先去其他地方看看吧。¤I'd better look elsewhere.
你感受到，此地或有玄妙但不得要领。¤You feel that this place may be mysterious but not essential.
嗯？这里应该还有一层空间被封印了。¤Ok? There should be another layer of space sealed here.
哈哈，不过如此嘛~¤Haha, but that's it~
眼前的是一片巨大的陷坑，一旁破败的石碑上写着灵药园，三个大字。¤In front of him is a huge pit, and on the side of the dilapidated stone tablet is written the Spirit Medicine Garden, three big characters.
看来这就是上古龙宫的灵药园，不过已经被喷涌的龙脉之力摧毁殆尽了。¤It seems that this is the Pill garden of the Ancient Dragon Palace, but it has been completely destroyed by the power of the gushing dragon veins.
想必玄道宗正是通过这股灵气以感应天魔令持有者位置的吧。¤Presumably Mystic Dao Sect used this aura to sense the position of the holder of the Heavenly Demon Order.
正如{shixiong}所言，这东西可得小心宝贝着，不然寻个机缘倒要搭上性命。¤As {shixiong} said, you have to be careful with this thing, or you have to find a chance to take your life.
要是你停止运转功法，以你现在的体质，应该只能坚持几分钟的时间。¤If you stop running the exercises, with your current physique, you should only last a few minutes.
看样子想和大师兄说上话要先排队才行了，不如乘机问一下前面的同门在此等候的目的。¤It seems that if you want to talk to the big brother, you have to line up first. It's better to take the opportunity to ask the person in front of you for the purpose of waiting here.
师兄......¤Brother...
感觉怎么样？¤how do you feel?
有意思，这离火门挺大的手笔，居然将整座山门建在一座活火山之上，还弄了座大阵，将火灵气都聚集在一起，难怪气温会如此之高。¤Interestingly, this handwriting that is far from the Heavenly Fire Gate actually built the entire mountain gate on an active volcano, and also built a large array to gather the fire spirits together. No wonder the temperature is so high.
你对火之道的感悟略微提升了。¤Your perception of the way of fire has slightly improved.
走在前面的离火门弟子停下脚步，回头看了你一眼。¤The Heavenly Fire Gate disciple who walked in front stopped and looked back at you.
（怪不得刚刚那离火门弟子说，只有意志坚定，一心向道的人才能坚持下去...）¤(No wonder the disciple from the Heavenly Fire Gate just said that only those who are determined and committed to the Tao can persevere...)
路我就带到这里，那边在广场上舞剑的，就是我们的大师兄炎萧，目前外门弟子的相关事宜都由他来负责，你先去向大师兄报道吧。¤I'll bring it here. The person dancing swords on the square over there is our senior brother Yan Xiao. At present, he is responsible for all matters related to the outer disciples. You should report to the senior brother first.
他递给你一块玉白色令牌，触手温润厚实，上面似有若无的灵力波动给人一种中正宁和之感。¤He hands you a jade-white token, with warm and thick tentacles, and the seemingly non-existent spiritual fluctuations on it give people a sense of peace and harmony.
稍后会有长老带队引领诸位师弟师妹前往天魔眼，{shidi}若无要事可一同出发。¤Later, there will be elders leading the team to lead you to the Eye of the Demon, {shidi} can set off together if you have nothing to do.
别看我这副模样，其实我今年才25岁。¤Don't look at me, I'm actually only 25 years old this year.
既然你能坚持走到这里，那你便算是我们离火门的外门弟子了。¤Since you can insist on walking here, then you are our outer disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate.
快看！那就是上次在天魔眼被玄道宗长老称赞的{shidi}！¤Look! That's the {shidi} praised by the elder Mystic Daozong in the eyes of the demon last time!
嘘，长老过来了，你声音小些。¤Hush, the elder is here, your voice is quieter.
参与外门讲法，修为+{color=#d0380a}500{/color}¤Participate in outer disciple's lecture, and cultivate as +{color=#d0380a}500{/color}
宗门广场较往日热闹许多，大师兄像是在分发某样物品。他面前身的修士排成长龙，放眼望去就连几位平日醉心修练的师兄弟也站在其中。¤Zongmen Square is much more lively than in the past, and the senior brother seems to be distributing something. The cultivators in front of him are platooned with dragons, and even a few senior brothers who are immersed in practice are also standing in it.
你来到宗门广场，擂台已经搭好，不少外门弟子三五成群地聚集于此，每三十年一次的宗门大比就要开始了...¤When you come to Zongmen Square, the ring has been set up. Many outer disciples gather here in groups of three or five. The Zongmen Competition is about to begin every thirty years...
这么说来，若天魔令丢失的话岂不是一辈子都要困在那里了？¤So, if the demon order is lost, wouldn't it be trapped there for the rest of my life?
也不知他是怎么杀了那么多魔物的...要是我也能这么厉害就好了。¤I don't know how he killed so many monsters...If only I could be so powerful.
（好热...即便是不停地运转灵气护住周身，也可以感受到滚滚而来的热浪。）¤(It's so hot...Even if you keep running the aura to protect your body, you can still feel the heat waves coming in.)
{shidi}，稍后便会有长老带我们一同前往天魔眼，你若无要事的话便可同我们一起出发。¤{shidi}, the elders will take us to the Eye of the Demon later, if you have nothing to do, you can go with us.
{shixiong}怎地甚也不知？这天魔令乃玄道宗所制，凡是进入天魔眼的各大门派弟子都必须携带，否则无法从试炼之地脱身。¤{shixiong} don’t know anything? This celestial demon order is made by Mystic Dao sect, and all disciples of all martial sects who enter the eyes of the celestial devil must carry it, otherwise they cannot escape from the place of trial.
天魔令？¤Devil order?
噗嗤，那个猎魔试炼杀了{$TempValue}只魔物的{shidi}回来了。¤Puff, the {shidi} who killed the {$TempValue} monster in the demon hunting trial is back.
宗门广场较往日热闹许多，大师兄像是在分发某样物品。他面前的修士排成长龙，放眼望去就连几位平日醉心修练的师兄弟也站在其中。¤Zongmen Square is much more lively than in the past. Senior brother seems to be distributing something. The cultivators in front of him are platooned with dragons, and even a few senior brothers who are enthusiastic about training are also standing in it.
站在你前方的人相貌老成，似乎应该称呼他师兄。¤The person standing in front of you is so mature that he should be called Senior Brother.
“果然人无完人，天才也是会有缺陷的......”¤Sure enough, no one is perfect, and geniuses are also flawed...
叫谁师兄呢？长得老也算是错吗？¤Brother who is it called? Is it wrong to grow old?
玄道宗长老虽是元婴大能，也不可长时运作如此庞大的阵法。届时{shixiong}怀揣天魔令，便于玄道宗捕捉你的方位。¤Although the elders of Mystic Dao Sect are powerful, they cannot operate such a huge formation for a long time. At that time, {shixiong} will carry the celestial demon order so that Mystic Dao Sect can capture your position.
请问师弟，大家聚集于此是为了......？¤My brother, do you gather here for...?
这便是天魔令，{FirstName}{shidi}切忌遗失，否则将迷失在试炼之地中。¤This is the demon order, {FirstName}{shidi} must not lose it, otherwise you will be lost in the trial ground.
你二人相谈甚欢，只觉时间飞逝，很快就来到大师兄面前。¤The two of you talked very happily, but felt that time flew by, and soon came to the big brother.
{shixiong}可是刚历练结束？猎魔试炼不日开启，炎萧大师兄正在发放{color=#d0380a}天魔令{/color}给即将启程的离火门弟子呢。¤{shixiong} is the end of the experience? The demon hunting trial will soon begin. Brother Yanxiao is issuing {color=#d0380a}Demon Decree{/color} to the disciples who are from Heavenly Fire Gate.
唉，你这次猎魔试炼的表现实在拖离火门后腿，此后可千万勤加修炼，切莫再如此丢老夫的脸面。¤Alas, your performance in the demon-hunting trial this time has really held us Heavenly Fire Gate back. From now on, you must work hard to practice and don't ever again embarrass me like this.
待{color=#d0380a}三十日{/color}期满，玄道宗长老法力恢复，即可将诸门派弟子传出天魔眼。¤When the {color=#d0380a}30 days{/color} period has expired and the elders of the Mystic Dao Sect have recovered their magic power, they will pass the disciples of all sects out of the Heavenly Demon Eye.
你来到宗门广场，传功长老正在讲法，不少外门弟子也已经来到了这里。这场讲法预计会持续一个月的时间，你准备参加么？¤You came to Zongmen Square. The Instructor Elder is teaching the Fa, and many outside disciples have already arrived here. This lecture is expected to last a month. Are you ready to participate?
嗯，不错。¤Yes, Not Bad.
还是先去找大师兄报道把。¤It's better to go to the big brother first to report to put.
哈哈哈，这可是我们竹山宗的幸事啊。以天灵根这样的资质天赋，哪怕只是安安稳稳的待在门内修炼，未来至少也能有金丹期的成就。¤Hahahaha, this is a fortunate thing for our Bamboo Mountain Sect. With a talent like the Heavenly Spiritual Root, even if you just stay in the sect and cultivate quietly, you can at least have a Golden Core stage achievement in the future.
是。¤Yes.
{FirstName}师侄，你可曾听说过“天魔眼”？¤Martial Nephew {FirstName}, have you ever heard of the Heavenly Demon Eye?
世间纷扰众多，望你勤加修炼，莫要分心。¤There are many turbulences in the world, I hope you will practice diligently, and don’t be distracted.
青蛇是我派最年轻的长老，但一身{color=#d0380a}毒功{/color}已经出神入化，实乃我派千年一遇的奇才。他的独门功法是《五毒蚀心诀》。¤Azure snake is the youngest elder of my sect, but he uses{color=#d0380a}poison skills{/color}, making him strong in combat. His unique exercise is Heart Corroding Venom.
小友，我问你，你可愿意拜入我门下，做我的亲传弟子？¤Little friend, I ask you, would you like to join the sect under me and become my personal disciple?
千万年来，因为实力不济，或是心智不够坚定而身死道销的“天才”数不胜数。古人云：成大事者，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨。¤For thousands of years, there have been countless talents and geniuses who have died because of their lack of strength or determination! As the ancients said; those who want to succeed must first suffer and thus temper their will and body
另外，按本派的规矩，外门弟子若是能突破筑基期，便能晋升为内门弟子，拜入我派在座的任意一名长老门下继续修行。¤In addition, according to the rules of this school, if the outer disciple can break through the foundation building period, he can be promoted to the inner disciple, and he will continue to practice under any of the elders in my group.
除了我以外，本门还有三名授业长老在招收弟子，你想先了解哪一位？¤Other than me, there are three elders willing to recruit you as their disciple. Which one do you want to hear about first?
他没有太多表示，只是冷冷地朝你点了点头。¤He didn't say much, just gave you a cold nod.
你走到紫菱仙子身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Lady Ziling and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
长春真人是我的师弟，同样精通{color=#d0380a}缠绕{/color}法门，已将我派的《万象寄生诀》练到极为高深的层次。¤Lord Eternal Spring is my martial brother, who is also proficient in keeping enemies {color=#d0380a}Tangled{/color}. He has cultivated our sect's 《Infinite Parasitism》to a very high degree.
按古籍记载，这天魔眼所在的地方，本是宁州一处极为富饶的灵脉所在。但不知从何时起，这里竟开始源源不断地产生魔气。¤According to the ancient records, the place where the Demon Eye is located was originally a very rich spiritual vein in Ning Province. But it suddenly started emitting a stream of demonic energy..
……依我之见，纵然是天灵根，若不好生雕琢，将来也未必能成大器。¤...In my opinion, even if it's a Heavenly Spiritual Root, if it's not well carved it wont be able to become a great asset in the future...
谢谢师父。¤Thank you Master.
万年前的那场正魔大战，魔道大费周章入侵宁州，便是为了解除这天魔眼的封印。虽然最终击退了魔道，但天魔眼的封印也因此出现了松动。此后，偶尔散溢的魔气便会慢慢凝聚成一种没有灵智的下等魔。¤In the battle of Righteous vs Demonic tens of thousands of years ago, those of the Demon Dao spent a lot of resources trying to invade Ning Province with the sole purpose of removing the seal. Although the evil cultivators were eventually repelled, the seal loosened as a result. Over time, the small emounts of demonic energy would condense into a type of inferior demon without intelligence.
本座如今修为已达元婴期瓶颈，要专心为之后的天劫做好准备，青麟是本座的关门弟子，之后也不会再收弟子了。¤Now, my cultivation base has long reached the bottleneck of the Nascent Soul and must concentrate on preparing for the future tribulation.. Qinqlin is my personal disciple and I wont be accepting any more in the immediate future.
当然，参加猎魔试炼也有不小的危险，虽然门派会有相应的奖励补偿，但是否参与还是全凭自愿。距离下一次的猎魔试炼还有一段时间，你可以去找参加过往届试炼的师兄了解情况以后，再作决定。¤Of course, participating in the hunt is quite dangerous. Although the sect will have rewards and compensation according to the amount of demons you slay, participation is entirely voluntary. There is still a period of time before the next opening, you can go find those who participated before if you want before making your decision.
好了，诸位先别吵了。我看这样，还是让这位小友自己选吧。¤Well, let's not quarrel for now, I think we should let this little friend decide who to take as their master themselves.
这些下等魔短期内虽然不足为虑，但若是放任不管，也会带来不少祸端。因此，我们各大门派约定俗成，每隔二十年会打开一次天魔眼外的禁制，令门内弟子前去清缴。¤These inferior demons aren't much to worry about in the short term, but if they were left unattended they could bring a lot of misfortune. Therefore, our sects have agreed that every 20 years we would gather outside the Heavenly Demon Eye and lift the restriction, making the younger disciples of our sects go clear it while also using it as a training opportunity.
此针，名为青蛇，乃是我年轻时所炼制最为顺手的武器，今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This needle, called the Green Snake, is the most handy weapon I made when I was young, and I will give it to you today as a gift.
好，在你{color=#d0380a}结丹之前{/color}，就由为师来指点你吧。¤Well, before you {color=#d0380a}contains the Pill{/color}, it is up to the teacher to instruct you.
你走到青蛇真人身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Lord Azure Snake, and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
师尊，本届的宗门大比的结果出来了，这次夺魁的是{FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}。¤Master, the results of the Zongmen Grand Competition this time have come out. This time it is {FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}.
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一只玉盒扔给了你。你用神识扫过，盒中是一套飞针法器。¤After all, Master took out a jade box from the storage bag and threw it to you. You swiped it with your soul sense, and in the box is a set of flying needle instruments.
她笑着向你点了点头。¤She smiled and nodded to you.
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一把剑递给了你。¤After all, the master took out a sword from the storage bag and handed it to you.
灵脉遭到污染，附近的妖兽与人类也被魔气侵蚀魔化，当时的几大修真门派付出了很大的代价，才将这处魔地封印起来，阻止了魔气的进一步扩散。¤The spirit vein was contaminated, while the nearby monsters and people were eroded into demonic creatures. At that time, the several great sects paid a large price to seal the demonic energy in the land and prevent further spread.
紫菱师姐，此言差矣，掌门师兄还未发话，我们几人可一样可以有权利收他为徒。长春师兄，你怎么看？¤Senior Sister Ziling, you're being too hasty. The sect leader hasn't spoken yet and we all have the right to accept them as a disciple. Brother Changchun, what do you think?
天灵根，你可确定？¤Heavenly Spiritual Root? Are you sure?
{FirstName}{LastName}，按大比的规矩，从今日起你就是我派的内门弟子了。¤{FirstName}{LastName}, according to the rules of Taibi, you will be my inner disciple from today.
的的确确是纯净的天灵根，没有一丝一毫的杂灵根，这点我看的清清楚楚。¤It is indeed the Heavenly Spiritual Root, I can see no traces of imperfection.
这把剑名为飞花，乃为师年轻时所炼制，用起来颇为顺手。今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This sword is called Feihua, it was refined by the teacher when he was young, and it is quite easy to use. It's a gift for you today.
希望你学成之后能闯出点名堂来，莫要辱没为师的名头！¤I hope you can make a name for yourself after studying under me, don't humiliate my name as a teacher!
不错，不错...本门下一届能参加猎魔试炼的筑基弟子又算增加一人，实乃可喜可贺之事啊。¤Yes, that's right... the next generation of this school can participate in the Demon Hunting Trial, and one more disciple will be added, which is really a gratifying thing.
距离下一次的猎魔试炼还有一段时间，你可以去找参加过往届试炼的师兄了解情况以后，再作决定。¤There is still some time before the next demon hunting trial. You can go to the seniors who participated in the previous trials to find out about the situation, and then make a decision.
修仙一途有太多邪魔歪道，为师只希望你能一直坚守正道，恪守本心。¤There are too many demons and crooked ways on the way to immortal cultivation. As a teacher, I only hope that you can always stick to the right way and abide by your original heart.
不错，不错，你这{xiaozi}还算是有眼光。¤Not bad, not bad, {xiaozi} you have quite a discerning eye.
此剑，名为虬木，你收着吧。¤This sword is called Qiu Mu, please keep it.
{FirstName}{LastName}，你虽有百年难得一遇的灵根天赋，但修炼一途也并非只靠着天赋便能取得大成就的。¤{FirstName}{LastName}, although you have the once-in-a-century Heavenly Spiritual Root, you can not rely only on your talent to achieve great things.
见过掌门师伯。¤Well Met sect master.
猎魔试炼？¤Demon hunting trial?
嗯，既然你已经有所了解，那我便不再多说了。参加猎魔试炼也有不小的危险，虽然门派会有相应的奖励补偿，但是否参与还是全凭自愿。¤Well, since you already know something, then I won't say more. Participating in the demon hunting trial is also not a small danger. Although there will be corresponding rewards and compensations for the sect, whether to participate is entirely voluntary.
师尊，{FirstName}{shidi}近日已突破至筑基期，特来禀明此事。¤Master, {FirstName}{shidi} has recently broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm and has come to report this.
紫菱是我派大长老，修为不弱于我。她主修的《九冲图集》乃我派秘术，能够利用{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}之力提升木系法门的威能，并使对手被多种负面状态缠身，威能不俗。¤Ziling is the Grand Elder of our sect, who's cultivation is no less than mine. The Nine Rush Atlas Arts she specializes in is a secret technique, which can use {color=#d0380a}the Elemental Cycle{/color} to improve the impact of Wood-based skills. It also entangles the enemy in a forest of negative status, very powerful in combat.
这么一来，你就是我的徒弟了，在你{color=#d0380a}结丹之前{/color}，可要好好照我说的练。¤From now on, you are my disciple. Before you reach the {color=#d0380a}Golden Core Realm{/color}, you must follow my instructions properly.
既然如此，{color=#d0380a}结丹之前{/color}，便由我来指导你。¤That being the case, before {color=#d0380a}contains the Pill{/color}, I will guide you.
禀掌门师尊，今年的招收的外门弟子中，收取到了一名资质鉴定为天灵根的弟子，名叫{FirstName}{LastName}！¤Sect Leader, this year's recruitment has resulted in a disciple with a Heavenly Spiritual Root, their name is {FirstName}{LastName}!
此番虽破格收录你为内门弟子，但你仍需在外门磨炼数年，与其他炼气期的外门弟子一样修行，不能有半点骄横。¤Although an exception was made and you were recruited directly into the inner sect, you still need to cultivate for several years the same as those in the outer sect while in the Qi Refining Period, without any arrogance.
弟子谨记掌门教诲。¤This disciple will remember the words of Master.
你走到长春真人身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Lord Eternal Spring and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
要离开这里么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Do you want to leave here? {w}{w=0.5}
眼前是一根完好的引雷柱。¤In front of him is a perfect lightning rod.
此物乃是上古龙族遗物，先行收走吧。¤This thing is the relic of the ancient dragon race, let's take it away first.
眼前的引雷柱已经损坏。¤The lightning rod in front of him has been damaged.
可惜...¤pity...
“轰~~”¤Boom~~
你立足未稳却有数道闪电，直扑面门而来。¤You are unsteady, but there are several lightning bolts, and they come straight to the door.
那是？¤That is?
定睛看去，半空中一团雷云凝聚，雷云之中竟有一团银色火焰。¤Looking closely, a thundercloud condensed in mid-air, and there was a silver flame in the thundercloud.
{vpunch=10,0.5}九龙天雷火？？？！！！这传说竟是真的？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Kowloon Tianleihuo? ? ? ! ! ! Is this legend true?
与老爷子心神相通的你，感受到魏无极现在心神动荡，甚至神魂不稳。¤You, who are in sympathy with the old man, feel that Wei Wuji is in turmoil now, and even his spirit is unstable.
师父？¤Master?
师父？？！！¤Master? ? ! !
{vpunch=10,0.5}老头？？？！！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Old man? ? ? ! ! !
臭{xiaozi}喊什么喊？懂不懂尊师重道？¤What are you shouting? Do you know how to respect teachers?
此物究竟是？¤What is this thing?
呼~~为师若是没有猜错，这应该就是龙族世代相承的异火“九龙天雷火”。¤Hu~~ If the teacher guessed correctly, this should be the different fire Kowloon Tianleihuo that has been inherited from generation to generation by the dragon family.
这九龙天雷火本是于雷鸣海“九霄雷狱”之中诞生的异火，有引雷淬体之效，加之龙族历代龙皇辅以龙脉温养，同时又有炼魂养魄之效，据传当年龙族元婴强者突破化神之时都会借助此火淬体炼魂。¤This Jiulong Tianleihuo was originally a different fire born in the Jiuxiao Thunder Prison of Lei Minghai. It has the effect of attracting thunder and quenching the body. In addition, the dragon emperors of the dragon races of all dynasties are supplemented by the dragon veins to warm and nourish, and at the same time, it has the effect of refining the soul and nourishing the soul. It is rumored that when the Dragon Clan's Nascent Soul powerhouse broke through to Deity Transformation, they would use this fire to quench their bodies and refine their souls.
炼魂养魄？老头那你是不是也能...还阳了？¤Refining the soul? Old man, can you also... return the sun?
哪有这么容易？不过若能修补神魂，至少能离开这剑...¤How can it be so easy? But if you can repair the soul, at least you can leave this sword...
这位寄宿于剑中的道友若能得九龙天雷火温养确实大有裨益。¤If this fellow daoist who lives in the sword can be nourished by the Nine Dragons Heavenly Thunder Fire, it will be of great benefit.
{vpunch=10,0.5}谁？（我竟没有发现此地还有旁人。）¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Who? (I didn't find anyone else here.)
还未介绍自己，本座龙皇九霄。¤I haven't introduced myself yet, this Dragon Emperor Jiuxiao.
你能感受到一股浩瀚的神识波动从眼前的异火中散开，你对他的神识试探宛若牛虻入海一般。¤You can feel a vast wave of spiritual consciousness spreading out from the strange fire in front of you, and your test of his spiritual consciousness is like a gadfly entering the sea.
小心，对方乃是化神修士，甚至有过之。¤Be careful, the opponent is a Deity Transformation cultivator, could be even stronger than that.
道友不必对我如此防备，现在的我不过是一缕仅靠着异火苟延残喘的神魂罢了。¤Fellow Daoists don't have to be so wary of me, now I'm just a wisp of divine soul lingering on the fire.
这雷电甚是霸道，不过竟有淬体之效。远处那是？¤This thunder and lightning is very domineering, but it has the effect of quenching the body. Is that in the distance?
原来小友身怀我族血脉。现在我龙族是何处境？龙皇是何人？现在是何时？¤It turns out that the little friend has the blood of my family. What is the situation of my dragon clan now? Who is the Dragon King? When is it now?
小友，现在是何时？来跟我说说现在我族近况如何？¤Little friend, what time is it now? Come and tell me how my family is doing now?
按你的说法，我龙族自大战之后一蹶不振，现在族中甚至没有化神强者坐镇？只得龟缩一隅？¤According to what you said, my dragon clan has been slumped since the war, and now there is no Deity Transformation powerhouse in the clan? Had to shrink in a corner?
唉，我敖铭愧对先祖啊。¤Alas, I, Ao Ming, are ashamed of my ancestors.
幽炎诀？我弟弟已经把这传给你了？那他是不是已经...¤You Yan Trick? My brother has passed this on to you? Has he been...
.....嗯¤.....Ok
小友，我有事相求。¤Little friend, I have something to ask for.
请讲¤Speaking
放心你既然已经习得幽炎诀，我定会破例将九龙天雷火的火种分你一支。¤Don't worry, since you have already learned the Secret Flame Art, I will make an exception to divide the fire from the Nine Dragons Heavenly Thunder Fire to you.
我肉身损毁借助异火修炼，神识过于强大为天地法则所不容，贸然离开这九霄雷狱阵必然引下天劫魂飞魄散，还请你去往龙宫内的化龙池寻得龙魂石带我出去。¤My flesh is destroyed with the help of foreign fire cultivation, soul sense is too powerful for the laws of heaven and earth will not allow, rashly leave this nine heavenly thunder prison formation is bound to lead to heavenly calamity soul scattered, but please go to the dragon palace dragon pond to find the dragon soul stone to take me out.
龙魂石？您看可是此物？¤Dragon Soul Stone? You see this thing?
正是，这火种小友留下¤Exactly, this little friend of Tinder stayed
小友，这九霄雷狱阵的引雷柱都是不可多得的至宝，龙宫沉没在即，你还是尽数带去比较好。¤Little friend, the lightning rods of the Jiuxiao Thunder Prison Array are all rare treasures. The Dragon Palace is about to sink, so you'd better take all of them with you.
说罢空中异火分出一只火苗向你飞来，其余的钻入了你手中的龙魂石。¤After speaking, the different fire in the air separated a flame and flew towards you, and the rest got into the dragon soul stone in your hand.
好。¤Excellent.
小友还是快去快回为好。¤It's better to go back quickly, little friend.
火焰升腾间，隐隐间能够见到九条银色火龙，在火焰之内穿梭而行，九条细小的火龙在其中四下穿梭，犹如具备着灵智一般，而且隐隐间，有着许些龙威从中弥漫而出。¤As the flames rise, you can vaguely see nine silver fire dragons, shuttled through the flames, nine small fire dragons shuttled around in it, as if possessing wisdom, and faintly, there are some dragons that permeate from it. out.
正阳道长是我派最年轻的长老，资质悟性极高，已将我派{color=#d0380a}化焰术{/color}练得炉火纯青，再加上他的独门功法《熔盾决》，与人对敌时总能立于不败之地。¤Elder Bright Sun is the youngest elder in my school. He has extremely high aptitude and insight. He has mastered our sect's {color=#d0380a}Living Flame{/color} technique to perfection, plus his own unique technique, the Molten Shield., allows him to always assume an undeatable position when facing enemies.
你走到火云老祖身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Patriarch Flamecloud and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
{shidi}，我派目前共有三位授业长老，你想先了解哪一位？¤{shidi}, there are currently three elders in my group, which one do you want to know first?
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一只木盒，扔给了你。你用神识扫过，盒中是一套飞针法器。¤After saying this, master took out a jade box from their storage ring and threw it to you. You swiped it with your soul sense, discovering a set of flying needles inside.
苍坤上人极擅炼器，他主修的《焚心诀》能精确地控制温度极高的真火，可燃尽天下万物，对敌时更能{color=#d0380a}灼伤{/color}对手，威力不俗。¤Venerable Cang Kun is very good at refining weapons. The Burning Heart Technique he majors in can accurately control the extremely high temperature of real fire, which can burn everything in the world, and can {color=#d0380a}burn{/color} when fighting the enemy. Opponent, powerful.
此匣，名为赤离，乃是我年轻时随手炼制的武器，今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This box, called Chili, is a weapon I made with my hands when I was young, and I will give it to you today as a gift.
{shidi}，我派目前共有3位授业长老，你想先了解哪一位？¤{shidi}, there are currently 3 elders in my delegation, which one do you want to know first?
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一个匣子，扔给了你。¤After all, the master took out a box from the storage bag and threw it to you.
哈哈哈，不错，你这{xiaozi}还算是有眼光。¤Hahahaha, not bad, {xiaozi} you have quite a discerning eye.
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一柄环状武器，递给了你。¤After all, the master took out a ring-shaped weapon from the storage bag and handed it to you.
不错萧儿，辛苦你了。¤Not bad Xiaoer, thank you for your hard work.
{FirstName}{LastName}，从今日起你就是我派的内门弟子了。¤{FirstName}{LastName}, you will be my inner disciple from today.
这把环名为苍炎，乃为师年轻时所用，颇为顺手。今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This ring, called Cang Yan, was used by the teacher when he was young, and it was quite handy. It's a gift for you today.
是，师尊¤Yes, Master
你走到正阳道长身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Lord Bright Sun and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
修仙一途凶险无比，希望你凡事都要步步为营，三思而行。¤The journey of cultivating immortals is extremely dangerous. I hope you will take every step and think twice about everything.
只见他笑着向你点了点头。¤He smiled and nodded to you.
你走到苍坤上人身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Venerable Pale Earth and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
此针，名为火柳，乃是我年轻时所炼制最为顺手的武器，今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This needle, named Huo Liu, is the most handy weapon I made when I was young, and I will give it to you as a gift today.
是，师尊。¤Yes, Master.
火云老祖乃我派大长老，修为已达元婴期。他的独门功法《叠焰决》是门派内数一数二的战斗型功法，对敌时可运用{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}之力提升火系法门威能，大长老便是凭此功法在宁州打下的赫赫威名。¤Patriarch Flamecloud is the Grand Elder of our sect, a Nascent Soul realm cultivator. His unique technique Flame Strata Arts is one of the best combat techniques in the sect. It utilizes {color=#d0380a}the Elemental Cycle{/color} to enhances the power of the fire skills, and the Grand Elder's prestigious name was made in Ning Province by this technique.
按大比的规矩，你可以从自行选择拜入在座的任意一名长老门下继续修行。萧儿，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤According to the rules of the Big Competition, you can continue to practice under any of the elders you choose to worship. Xiaoer, you can introduce the situation of the elders to you {shidi}.
萧儿，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤Xiao'er, please tell you {shidi} about the situation of the elders.
这里似乎曾经是御剑门的宗门大殿，却也是一路走来损毁最为严重的地方，可以想象当年那场大战的惨烈。¤This seems to have been the sect hall of the Imperial Sword Sect, but it was also the most severely damaged place along the way, so you can imagine the tragedy of that great battle back then.
这里曾是御剑门种植灵药的药园，如今虽然荒废了大半，但仍然可以找到些许存活的灵药。{w}{w=0.5}¤This was once the medicinal garden where the Imperial Sword Sect planted spiritual medicines, and now it is mostly deserted, but you can still find some surviving spiritual medicines. {w}{w=0.5}
这里曾是御剑门外门弟子的住所，当年大战后便被洗劫一空，你什么都没有找到。\n¤This was once the residence of the outer disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect, and it was ransacked after the great battle that year, and you found nothing. \n
藏剑阁里空荡荡的，除了一些破损的残片以外，你什么都没有找到。¤The hidden sword pavilion is empty, except for some broken fragments, you found nothing.
哎，又白忙活一场...¤Oops, another job in vain...
这禁制连你都能打破，你以为一千年前的那些人会被它拦住么。只怕是这禁制太弱，他们压根就没把它当回事吧。¤This ban even you can break, you think those people a thousand years ago will be stopped by it. I'm afraid the ban is too weak, they simply do not take it seriously.
不是吧，费那么大劲才破了那层禁制，这藏剑阁里怎么只有这点儿东西啊？¤No way, it took so much effort to break the ban, how come this is the only thing in the Hidden Sword Pavilion?
你把它收好，说不定日后会有所发现的。¤You put it away, maybe you will find something later.
也不尽然...那片破碎的玉佩虽然看起来普通，但上面雕刻的图案纹样倒是让我有一种莫名熟悉的感觉。¤Not exactly... The broken jade pendant looks ordinary, but the pattern carved on it gives me an inexplicably familiar feeling.
你走近养剑池，只见池中漂浮着一柄魔气四溢的灵剑，数条锁链从池底生出，将它牢牢锁住。¤You approach the sword raising pond, only to see a demonic spirit sword floating in the pond, and several chains arise from the bottom of the pond, locking it firmly in place.
{vpunch=10,0.5}这...这是？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}This... This is?
筑基期！？？¤Foundation period! ? ?
啧啧，我原本还奇怪，那些普通的剑灵怎么会有灵智来攻击我们，原来是它在指挥。¤Tsk, I originally wondered how those ordinary sword spirits could have the spiritual intelligence to attack us, but it turns out that it was directing it.
这只剑灵可不得了，本身的修为就已经可以和筑基巅峰的人类修士媲美，又已经产生了灵智。恐怕只有纯阳法宝这一级别的仙剑，才能自行孕育出这么强大的剑灵。¤This sword spirit is remarkable, its own cultivation is already comparable to that of a human cultivator at the peak of Foundation Establishment, and it has developed spiritual intelligence. I'm afraid that only an immortal sword at the level of a pure Yang magic treasure can breed such a powerful sword spirit on its own.
不过你也不用太担心，捆住它的这条锁链也不是凡品，我看它现在能发挥出来的功力应该还不足两成。¤But you don't have to worry too much, the chain that binds it is not ordinary, I think it can now play out less than 20% of its power.
老头儿，我只是来这遗迹里勘察一番，这剑灵明显超过了我能处理的范围嘛，既然已经弄清楚缘由了，要不还是先回宗门...¤Old man, I just came to investigate the ruins. This sword spirit is obviously beyond the scope of what I can handle. Since I have figured out the reason, why don't I go back to the sect first...
话音未落，你身后的{color=#d0380a}锈渍铁剑{/color}突然强烈地抖动起来，清亮的剑鸣声再度响起。那被锁链捆住的剑灵仿佛受到了呼应，魔气开始翻涌，数道红色的剑气向你袭来...¤The {color=#d0380a}rust-stained iron sword {/color} behind you suddenly trembled strongly, and the clear sound of the sword sounded again. The sword spirit that was bound by the chains seemed to be echoed, and the demonic energy began to surge, and several red Sword Qi came towards you...
你听到右边的房间传来剑气交错的声音。¤You hear the sound of Sword Qi staggering from the room to your right.
这里曾是御剑门炼器的地方，角落里还散落着一些低阶的炼器材料，除此以外再没有什么有价值的东西了。¤This used to be the place where the Imperial Sword Sect smiths, and there are still some low-grade smithing materials scattered in the corner, but nothing of value beyond that.
就是这里了。¤This is the place.
魏无极两手结成状若莲瓣的指诀，一道虚晃的灵光闪过，刻有古朴花纹的石壁缓缓自当中分开，露出一条可供一人通过的小径。¤Wei Wuji's two hands formed a finger trick like lotus petals, a wavering spiritual light flashed, the stone wall carved with ancient patterns slowly parted from the middle, revealing a path for one person to pass.
如果我没记错，秘阁里应当存放着御剑门全部的功法秘籍，以及我修炼的心得笔录。¤If I remember correctly, the secret pavilion should hold all of the secret manuals of the Imperial Sword Sect, as well as my cultivation tips and transcripts.
或许能在我当年的记录中找到一些关于缺失记忆的线索。¤Maybe I can find some clues about the missing memories in my records back then.
希望如此吧...¤Let's hope so...
你沿着狭小的甬道前行，也许是与外界隔绝的缘故，陡峭的石阶上并未沾染太多的灰尘。¤You walk along the narrow tunnel, perhaps because of the isolation from the outside world, the steep stone steps are not too dusty.
当年我在此处建造秘阁本是为了保护门派传承，没想到千年后门派覆灭，而我又以另一种方式故地重游。¤When I built the secret pavilion here to protect the sect's heritage, I did not expect the sect to be destroyed after a thousand years, and I revisited the place in another way.
这阶阶石梯皆为我亲手削除山石所成，那石壁上的阵法也为我亲手刻画，现在想来初创门派时的景象历历在目，可惜那些雄心壮志早随着光阴的流逝而蹉跎了。¤The steps and stone stairs are made by my own hands to remove the stones, the stone wall formations are also carved by my own hands, now I think of the scene when the sect was first created vividly, but unfortunately those ambitions have long been wasted with the passage of time.
众求道者何不皆是如此？如此看来，什么天才英杰，也不过是芸芸众生中的平凡一员罢了。¤Why is this not the case for all seekers of the Way? In this way, what geniuses and heroes, but also ordinary members of the masses of life.
若无法得道成仙，自然只是沧海一粟。¤If you can not achieve immortality, naturally, just a drop in the ocean.
世人前仆后继踏上仙路，不正是为了那一丝渺茫的希望吗？¤The world has set out on the road to immortality for the slim hope, isn't it?
哈哈，正是如此，没想到我也有被你这{xiaozi}点悟的一天。¤I never thought I would be enlightened by you {xiaozi} one day.
你与魏无极谈笑间，石路已至尽头。¤You and Wei Wuji talk and laugh, the stone road has reached the end.
错落的书架上整齐地摆放着各种古籍，柔和的灵气火焰摇曳着，投下轻晃的影子。¤The staggered bookshelves are neatly arranged with various ancient books, soft aura flames swaying and casting lightly swaying shadows.
若没记错，我的笔录存放在右手边第三排书架上，将那本书架顶端最左侧的《灵妖录》向内用力推至全本没入凹槽便可打开暗格。¤If I remember correctly, my pen record is stored in the third row of shelves on the right hand side, push the Spiritual Demon Record on the leftmost side of the top of that shelf inward until the whole book is not in the groove to open the secret compartment.
你按照魏无极所言将那本书推进凹槽，“咔哒”一声，书架侧方的暗格应声而出。¤You push the book into the groove as Wei Wuji said, and with a click, the hidden compartment on the side of the shelf comes out.
这怎么可能！¤How is this possible?
你见魏无极如此震惊，便也凑上前去查看暗格中的内容。¤You see Wei Wuji so shocked, so also come forward to check the contents of the hidden compartment.
只见黑黢黢的木格中空空如也，哪里有什么魏无极所说的心得笔录！¤You see that the dark wooden compartment is empty, there is no record of Wei Wuji's experience!
魏老，你不会是记忆错乱了吧...该不会之前这里的东西被你移动过，但你没想起来？¤Wei Lao, you can't have a misunderstanding... Could it be that you moved something here before, but you didn't think about it?
虽然几率很小，但也不排除有这种可能...我们再找找秘阁内有没有其他的线索吧。¤Although the chances are slim, but we can't rule out the possibility... Let's find out if there are any other clues in the secret pavilion.
御剑门的秘阁并不算大，你们很快便在一处角落里发现了端倪。¤The secret pavilion of the Imperial Sword Sect is not that big, and you soon find clues in a corner.
一块朴素的石碑引起了魏无极的注意，你将目光投过去，发现上面刻着的两列小字：¤A plain stone tablet caught Wei Wuji's attention, and you cast your eyes over to find two small columns of words engraved on it.
尊师魏无极之墓¤The tomb of your revered master Wei Wuji
弟子 凌轩¤Disciple Ling Xuan
魏老，看来这秘阁并非没有人来过，还有之前的御剑门弟子为你立了墓碑呢。¤Wei Lao, it seems that this secret pavilion is not untouched by people, there are still previous disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect who have erected a tombstone for you.
是轩儿！当年他没死！¤It's Xuan'er! He didn't die back then!
这个凌轩...他是何人？¤This Ling Xuan... Who is he?
当年创建御剑门之初，我曾收下六名亲传弟子。凌轩是我座下大弟子，天赋最高，当年进入宁州古迹之时，他已有金丹巅峰修为，剑道感悟更是不在我之下。¤When I founded the Sword Sect, I took in six disciples. Ling Xuan was my eldest disciple and had the highest talent. When he entered the Ning Province monument, he had already reached the peak of the Golden Dan cultivation, and his sword sense was no less than mine.
当年他战至力竭，重伤昏迷...我本来以为他们都已经死了...¤When he fought until he was exhausted, he was seriously wounded and unconscious... I thought they were all dead...
仔细想来，这秘阁也似乎过于干净整洁了，完全不像一千多年没有人来过的样子。¤When I think about it, the secret pavilion also seems too clean and tidy, not at all like no one has been here for more than a thousand years.
或许暗格里的笔录也是被这个凌轩拿走的。¤Perhaps the dark compartment of the transcript was also taken by this Ling Xuan.
若是轩儿还活着,他一定能解答我们所有的疑问。只是一千多年过去了，即便轩儿后来突破到了元婴期，恐怕也...¤If Xuan'er is still alive, he will be able to answer all our questions. But more than a thousand years have passed, even if Xuan'er later broke through to the firstborn stage, I'm afraid...
你也说过他天赋最高，或许他就比你更进了一步，突破化神期了呢。¤You also said he had the highest talent, maybe he went one step further than you and broke through to the Deity Transformation stage.
让我想想...宁州...化神期...剑修...¤Let me think... Ning Province... Deity Transformation stage... Sword cultivator...
武陵城白帝！¤White Emperor of Wuling City!
魏老，你说有没有可能...？¤Elder Wei, do you think it's possible...?
哎...¤Hey...
此事我早已想过，只是那白帝楼所用的剑法神通与我御剑门完全不同，不似出于我门下传承。¤I have long thought about this matter, but the sword technique used by the White Emperor Manor is completely different from my Imperial Sword Sect, does not seem to come from my discipline's heritage.
没准是那凌轩又有了别的奇遇也未可知。总之秘阁线索已断，去白帝楼问问没准会有新的发现。¤Maybe it is that Ling Xuan and have other strange encounter also may not know. Anyway, the secret pavilion clues have been broken, go to the White Emperor Manor to ask may have a new discovery.
这里曾经是御剑门的炼丹房，时隔千年早已破败不堪。地火房损坏的似乎并不严重，但大部分的丹药想必都在当年那场大战后被洗劫一空，你只在房间的角落找到一张破旧的老丹方。¤This used to be the alchemy room of the Imperial Sword Sect, which has long since fallen into disrepair after a thousand years. The Earth Fire Room doesn't seem to be badly damaged, but most of the pills must have been looted after that great battle back then, and you only find an old, worn-out potion recipe in the corner of the room.
这间丹房也许还能继续使用，想在这里尝试炼丹么？{w}{w=0.5}¤This dan room might still be usable, want to try your hand at alchemy here? {w}{w=0.5}
要离开御剑门遗迹吗？¤Want to leave the ruins of the Imperial Sword Sect?
此处是一个矿脉，要在此采集吗？¤This place is a vein, want to collect it here?
这里曾是御剑门内门弟子的住所，当年大战后便被洗劫一空，你只找到一件破破烂烂的道袍。¤This was once the residence of the inner disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect, and it was looted after the great battle back then, and you only found a tattered daoist robe.
一道光幕挡住了你的去路。¤A curtain of light blocks your path.
这有什么可奇怪的，很多远古大能在自己洞府中布下的阵法与禁制都能够自行吸收天地灵气，持续个几十万年也没有问题。¤What is so strange about this, many ancient powers in their cave formations and prohibitions are able to absorb the heaven and earth spiritual energy on their own, last for hundreds of thousands of years without problems.
这道禁制倒也算不得什么了不起的东西，我看这应该只是门派用来{color=#d0380a}考验{/color}年轻弟子所设，没什么攻击性，只要你的法术能够将它短暂击溃，就可以通过了。¤This is not a great thing, I think this should only be used to {color=#d0380a} test {/color} young disciples set up by the sect, nothing offensive, as long as your spells can break it briefly, you can pass.
这御剑门都荒废了一千多年了，怎么还会有禁制存在？¤This Imperial Sword Sect has been deserted for over a thousand years, how can there still be prohibitions in place?
你走进房间，只见一块掉落在地上的牌匾上，写着“藏经阁”几个大字。这字看似平淡无奇，却透着一种无法说清的玄意，细看之下，竟觉得神识一阵恍惚，这几个字像是活了过来，化作几道人影在你的眼前舞剑。¤You walked into the room and saw a plaque that had fallen on the floor with the words Hidden Scripture Pavilion written on it. The words seem to be bland, but there is an indefinable mysterious meaning, look closely and feel a trance of consciousness, the words seem to come to life, transformed into several figures dancing swords in front of your eyes.
从书法中感受到的剑意令你有所顿悟，获得了一条新的{color=#d0380a}思绪{/color}。¤The sword intent you feel from the calligraphy gives you an epiphany and a new {color=#d0380a}thought{/color}.
{color=#d0380a}习得《九转游身剑》{/color}。¤{color=#d0380a}Acquire the Nine Turning Sword of the You {/color}.
{color=#d0380a}心境+3{/color}。¤{color=#d0380a}Mindfulness +3{/color}.
广场上游荡着不少的剑灵，看来想从这里过去应该免不了一场恶战。¤There are quite a few sword spirits wandering around the square, so it seems that trying to get past here should inevitably lead to a nasty battle.
游荡的剑灵发现了你，向你飞了过来。¤The wandering sword spirits spot you and fly towards you.
走过入口处的山门，一个破败的剑池出现在你眼前。剑池周围的石雕虽然毁坏了大半，但似乎别有玄机。¤Walking through the entrance gate, a crumbling sword pond appears before your eyes. The stone sculptures around the pool are mostly ruined, but there seems to be a mystery.
没等你细细参悟，你身后的锈渍铁剑竟开始微微颤抖，发出一道清脆的剑鸣之声，似乎在与问剑池呼应。¤Without waiting for you to understand, the rusted iron sword behind you begins to tremble slightly, emitting a crisp sword sound, seemingly echoing with the sword pool.
{vpunch=10,0.5}锈渍铁剑的剑鸣声似乎惊动了这里的剑灵。\n¤The sword chirping sound of the rusty iron sword seems to have alerted the sword spirits here. \n
这里的雕塑虽然被毁坏大半，但仍然能够感受到其中蕴含的剑意。¤The sculpture here is mostly destroyed, but the sword intent contained in it can still be felt.
这里是老夫当年所铸的明心问剑池...还记得当年御剑门弟子入门之日，都要先经过这里。¤Here is the bright heart asking sword pool forged by the old man back then... I still remember when the disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect had to pass through here first on the day of their initiation.
房间内剑气四溢，只见一名身穿竹山宗道袍的修士正被三把剑灵操控的飞剑围攻，险象环生，眼看就要顶不住了。¤The room is overflowing with Sword Qi, only to see a cultivator wearing the Daoist robe of the Bamboo Mountain Sect is surrounded by three flying swords controlled by sword spirits, and is in danger of being overwhelmed.
房间内剑气四溢，只见一名身穿离火门道袍的修士正被三把剑灵操控的飞剑围攻，险象环生，眼看就要顶不住了。¤The room is overflowing with Sword Qi, only to see a cultivator wearing the Daoist robe of the Heavenly Fire Gate is being surrounded by three flying swords controlled by sword spirits, and is in danger of being overwhelmed.
道友莫慌，我来助你。¤Daoist friend do not panic, I will help you.
你躲在门后没有出声，没撑多久，那人便被利剑刺中要害，倒在了地上。你刚想偷偷溜走，便被剑灵发现，一齐向你攻了过来。¤You hid behind the door without making a sound, did not last long, the man was stabbed by sharp swords in the vitals, fell to the ground. You were just trying to sneak away when the sword spirits found out and attacked you in unison.
你可以随意挑战他们，不过就算全赢了也没有什么奖励。¤You can challenge them at will, but there is no reward even if you win them all.
当然，作为《凡人筑基传》...我是说...《觅长生》的主角，在我创造的这个幻境中，你可以自由使用游戏中所有的功法，法术与法宝。¤Of course, as The Mortal Foundation...I mean...the protagonist of Longevity, in this illusion I created, you can freely use all the exercises, spells and magic weapons in the game.
你也可以从我这里买到任何你想使用的法宝，甚至随意更改你的灵根。¤You can also buy any magic weapon you want to use from me, and even change your spiritual root at will.
这...这是哪里？¤This...where is this?
总之...只有各个位面宇宙中有名有姓的重要角色才会被邀请来到这里。¤In short...Only important characters with names and surnames in the universe of all planes will be invited to come here.
别以为自己稳了，能来到这里的可没有弱者~让我看看你有多少潜力吧。¤Don't think you are stable, there are no weak people who can come here~ Let me see how much potential you have.
这里是我创造的一方小世界，你可以称这里为虚无幻境或者...时空枢纽什么的，这不重要。¤This is a small world I created. You can call this a phantom world or... a time-space hub, it doesn't matter.
确定要离开神仙斗法么？¤Sure you want to leave the divine combat?
在我失去意识这段时间里没发生什么吧？¤Nothing happened during the time I lost consciousness, right?
算你这{xiaozi}走运，这附近应该没有其他人被传送过来，而且魔物的实力也有限。¤Fortunately for you {xiaozi}, there should be no one else being teleported over here, and the power of the monster is also limited.
远方目力所及之处一些魔物漫无目的地游荡着，有几只甚至开始向你的方向行进。¤Some monsters wandered aimlessly as far as they could see, and a few even started to move in your direction.
醒了，{xiaozi}？第一次进行空间传送这样的反应很正常，一来二回习惯后就不会陷入短暂昏迷了。¤Wake up, {xiaozi}? It's normal to react like space teleport for the first time. After getting used to it, I won't fall into a short coma.
听了魏无极的话你看向周围，脚下的地面由于数千年受魔气侵蚀，呈现出一种让人感到不详的灰黑色彩，空气中也弥漫着一股令人作呕的刺鼻气味。¤After hearing Wei Wuji's words, you look around. The ground under your feet has been eroded by demonic energy for thousands of years, showing an unclear gray-black color, and there is also a disgusting pungent smell in the air. .
随着大阵之上精芒一闪，这座不知荒废了多久了传送阵竟然重新运转了起来...¤With a flash of light above the array, this I do not know how long the abandoned transmission array actually re-operated ...
所幸你曾学过一些{color=#d0380a}聚灵阵{/color}之类的基础阵法，竟也被你慢慢摸出一些头绪。¤The actual fact that you have learned some {color=#d0380a}gathering formation{/color} and other basic formations, you are slowly figuring out some ideas.
你将破损的灵石换下，又细细钻研了一整天...¤You will replace the broken spirit stone, and study carefully for a whole day...
但阵法之道奥秘无穷，你连最基础的{color=#d0380a}聚灵阵{/color}都未曾学会，此时面对破损的残阵更是无从下手。¤But the mystery of the way of formation is infinite, you have not even learned the most basic {color=#d0380a}spiritual formation{/color}, and now you are facing the broken remnants of the formation is unable to start.
尝试修复传送阵应该需要消耗不少时间与灵石，你决定...？¤Try to repair the transmission array should need to consume a lot of time and spirit stones, you decided ...?
不知是谁曾经在这里布下过一个传送阵，阵法虽已破败不堪，但细细观之，主要便是阵心那几枚灵石已然破裂，若是替换成新的，也许还有修复的可能...¤I don't know who once laid a teleportation formation here, the formation has been broken, but a closer look, the main is the formation of the heart of the few stones have been broken, if replaced with new, there may be a possibility of repair...
传送阵已经被修复好了，你决定...¤The transmission array has been repaired, you decide...
你刚踏入此地，便闻到一股浓烈的腥臭气味，伴随着强烈眩晕感便向你袭来。¤You have just stepped into this place, you will smell a strong fishy smell, accompanied by a strong sense of vertigo will come to you.
看来这是一片毒沼，而且毒性之强就连一般的筑基期修士都难以抵挡。你决定...？¤It seems that this is a poisonous swamp, and the toxicity is so strong that even the average Foundation Establishment cultivator can hardly resist. You decide...?
好在你身怀{color=#d0380a}辟毒珠{/color}这等奇物，寻找沼毒自然影响不到你太多。你运转灵气护住周身，便一口气冲出了这片毒沼。¤The good thing is that you are carrying {color=#d0380a}poison pearls {/color} and other wonders, the search for marsh poison naturally does not affect you too much. You run your aura to protect your body, and then rush out of this poisonous swamp in one breath.
好在你曾领悟过{color=#d0380a}《青蛇要诀》{/color}，对毒道亦有自己的理解，想要在这种毒沼中保全自己还不是什么难事。你运转灵气护住周身，便一口气冲出了这片毒沼。¤The good thing is that you have comprehended the {color=#d0380a}Azure Snake Sutra{/color} and have your own understanding of the Dao of Poison, so it's not difficult to preserve yourself in this poisonous swamp.

You can also get a good idea of what you're getting into by using your aura to protect your body, and you can get out of this poisonous swamp in one breath.
你于毒术一道可谓一窍不通，又没有什么辟毒的丹药或者法宝。运转的灵气很快便抵挡不住这沼毒，失去了意识，一头栽进了这毒沼之中...¤You know nothing about the poisonous art, and you don't have any pills or magic treasures to ward off poison. The operation of the aura will soon be unable to resist the swamp poison, lost consciousness and fell headlong into the poisonous swamp...
你服下一颗{color=#d0380a}清蕴丹{/color}，药力很快就生效了。你运转灵气护住周身，便一口气冲出了这片毒沼。¤You take a {color=#d0380a}clear yun dan{/color}, the medicinal power will soon take effect. You run your aura to protect your surroundings, and you rush out of this poisonous swamp in one breath.
你翻遍了储物袋，也没有找到能够解毒的丹药...¤You rummaged through your storage bag, but you didn't find a potion that could cure the poison...
眼前的水潭直径不过四五十米，但却深不见底，漆黑的水面下不断泛起刺骨的寒意，令人感到不安。¤The water pool in front of you is only 40 or 50 meters in diameter, but it's bottomless, and the dark water is constantly filled with a bone-chilling chill that makes people feel uneasy.
水潭的四周遍布着的都是些杂乱的石堆，但细细观之却能发现，石缝中长着数种颜色各异的奇花灵草，竟都是你以前没有见过的品种...¤The water pool is surrounded by a mess of stones, but a closer look can be found, the stone crevices are growing several kinds of different colors of strange flowers and grasses, but you have not seen the varieties before...
天才地宝的附近往往有强大的妖兽守护，你贸然出手，还没等接近石堆，刚刚平静的水潭便掀起一阵巨浪，一条数十丈长的巨蛇从水潭深处一跃而出，吐着鲜红蛇信向你攻来。¤The vicinity of genius treasures are often guarded by powerful Spirit Beasts, you rashly attacked, before approaching the stone pile, just Still Water pool will raise a huge wave, a dozens of feet long giant snake from the depths of the water pool leapt out, spitting bright red snake letter to attack you.
你将神识展开，蔓延到整个水潭的深处。刺骨的寒意令你的灵魂感到战栗...你只能隐隐约约感觉，有一个庞然大物盘踞于池底，从身形来看，应该是一条巨蟒。¤You spread your soul sense to the entire depths of the pool. A bone-chilling chill makes your soul tremble... You can only vaguely feel that there is a huge thing coiled at the bottom of the pool, and judging from the shape of the body, it should be a giant python.
当你再想进一步观察之时，一只硕大的蛇眼突然睁开，你只感到大脑一阵刺痛，只能连忙收回了神识。¤When you want to observe further, a large snake eyes suddenly opened, you only feel a tingling in the brain, you can only hastily retracted the soul sense.
刚刚平静的水潭突然就掀起一阵巨浪，一条数十丈长的巨蛇从水潭深处一跃而出...¤The calm pool of water suddenly raised a huge wave, a dozens of feet long giant snake from the depths of the pool leapt out...
你将神识展开，蔓延到整个水潭之中。刺骨的寒意令你的神识感到战栗，竟无法继续深入...¤You spread your soul sense to the entire water pool. The bone-chilling chill makes your soul sense shudder and you can't go any further...
虽然你无法探查到水下有些什么，但显然不是那么好对付的。你决定...¤Although you can not detect what is underwater, but apparently not so good to deal with. You decide...
你决定冒险出手，但还没等你接近石碓，刚刚平静的水潭便掀起一阵巨浪，一条数十丈长的巨蛇从水潭深处一跃而出，吐着鲜红蛇信向你攻来。¤You decide to take a risk, but before you can get close to the stone pestle, a huge wave rises from the newly Still Water pool, and a giant snake tens of feet long leaps out from the depths of the water pool, spitting out bright red snake letters and attacking you.
奇怪，怎么走路这么吃力？¤Strange, how to walk so hard?
你低头一看，地面已不再是坚实的土地，而是泥泞的沼泽。而这脚下的淤泥也不似寻常，即使运转灵气也难以抽身。¤You look down, the ground is no longer solid land, but a muddy swamp. The mud beneath your feet is also unusual, even if you run your aura, it is difficult to pull yourself out.
看来没有一定的{color=#d0380a}速度{/color}是闯不过这片沼泽的...你选择？¤It seems that there is no certain {color=#d0380a}speed{/color} to break through this swamp... Which one do you choose?
你不愿冒这风险，便及时地抽身离开了。¤You don't want to take that risk, so you pull away just in time.
情急之下，你发现右方似乎有一条隐蔽的小路，虽然不知通向何方，但总比困死在这沼泽里强。¤In a hurry, you find what appears to be a hidden path to your right, and although you don't know where it leads, it's better than being stuck in this swamp.
你想要借助速度一口气冲过沼泽，熟料还没冲出多远就陷入泥水中，动弹不得。¤You want to speed through the swamp in one fell swoop, but you can't move before you get too far out into the mud and water.
你只能小心翼翼地开始在沼泽上匍匐前进，在沼泽地中挣扎了整整五天后，你才成功脱身。¤You can only carefully begin to creep on the swamp, struggling in the swamp after five days, you managed to get out.
你只能小心翼翼地开始在沼泽上匍匐前进，在沼泽地中挣扎了数天后，你身上的天魔令突然开始发烫。¤You can only carefully begin to creep on the swamp, and after struggling in the swamp for several days, the Heavenly Demon Order on your body suddenly begins to glow.
原来是三十天的试炼时间已到，虽然你身处险地，但还是被天魔令成功传送回了外界...¤It turns out that the 30-day trial time has come to an end, and although you were in a dangerous place, you were still successfully transported back to the outside world by the Heavenly Demon Order...
你全力运转灵气，施展起遁术，有惊无险地通过了这片恐怖的沼泽...¤You ran your aura with all your might and casted your vanishment technique, and passed through this horrible swamp without any danger...
也不由竹山宗注灵，但这异乎寻常的灵力逆流，我却如此熟悉。¤I can't inject spirits from the Bamboo Mountain Sect, but this unusual reverse flow of spiritual power, I am so familiar with it.
莫非是……？¤Could it be...?
倪家家主见多识广，说不定能看出点门道。¤The head of the Ni family has a lot of knowledge, and he might be able to help a bit.
不知家主恢复得如何了？¤I wonder how the Patriarch is recovering?
酒过三巡，主客尽欢，不胜酒力的你正飘飘然之时，倪家家主忽然话锋一转。¤After three rounds of wine, the hosts and guests have enjoyed themselves, and you are drifting in and out of the drink when the head of the Ni family suddenly changes his tune.
可惜功力太浅，还未能完成蓄势，丹田却已枯竭。下一刻只觉天旋地转，你便不省人事。¤Unfortunately, your power is too weak, not yet completed the build-up, but your Dantian has dried up. The next moment just feel the sky spinning, you are unconscious.
可以答应他。我如今记忆全失，这柄剑是我唯一的线索。¤You can promise him. I have lost all memory now, this sword is my only clue.
多亏了阁下的灵药，家主现已无碍了。前些日子家主有些好转时曾提醒过老仆，若阁下到访便带您前往白帝楼。¤Thanks to your Pill, the Patriarch is now okay. The Patriarch reminded the old servant when he was getting better a few days ago that if you visit, he will take you to the Baidi Tower.
这倪府，可真不简单。¤This Ni Mansion, it is not simple.
反正来都来了，就去会会那倪家家主吧。他摆这阵仗，恐怕不是款待小辈这么简单。¤Anyway, I'm here, so let's meet the Patriarch of the Ni family. He set up this ceremony, I'm afraid it's not as simple as entertaining juniors.
阁下可是前来探访家主的？¤Your Excellency came to visit the Patriarch?
唔，看来不是离火门所铸，但材质绝非凡品。那么接下来……¤Well, it doesn't seem to be made by Heavenly Fire Gate, but the material is extraordinary. Then...
唔，剑身已经锈蚀不堪，看不出来历。但这还难不倒我。¤Well, the body of the sword has been rusted so badly that you can't see the history. But it still doesn't trouble me.
{xiaozi}，放心吧，以我的神通，他发现不了我。¤{xiaozi}, don't worry, with my magical powers, he can't find me.
那可不是，我还是第一次被这么多人行礼呢，现在走路都是飘的。¤That's not the case. It's the first time I've been saluted by so many people, and now I'm always walking.
家主还在休息中，请阁下月后再来吧。¤Patriarch is still resting, please come back in a month.
可我看你却一直背着这柄剑，莫非有什么原因？¤But I see you have been carrying this sword, is there any reason?
呵呵呵，年轻人，快请入座！今日这宴席只为答谢你一人而设。咱们一老一少以话佐酒，不必拘束。¤Please be seated, young man! Today's banquet is just to thank you. There is no need to be formal, as we are an old man and a young man, we will drink with words.
实不相瞒，这柄古剑乃是我机缘巧合所得。至今未能认主。¤To tell the truth, this ancient sword is coincidentally obtained by chance. So far, I have not been able to identify the owner.
但这份盎然的生机却化不开锈剑的死寂，仿佛绝美的乐曲中吱呀作响的杂音。¤But this vigorous vitality can't dissolve the deathly silence of Rusty Sword, like the creaking noise in beautiful music.
就让我看看，你是怎样的一柄剑吧。¤Let me see what a sword you are.
左手捏成剑诀，向你遥遥一指，锈剑竟直直向你破空而来！¤With his left hand, he points the sword at you, and the rusty sword comes straight at you!
但凡仙家法器，认主后便能收入体内，避免暴露虚实。¤But all immortal magic weapon, after the recognition of the owner can be integrated into the body to avoid exposing the real one.
下意识握住剑柄的瞬间，体内功力便被压榨一空。注入的灵气仿佛天雷勾动地火，与剑内激荡的意志共鸣。脱缰的怒火充斥了你的胸膛，双眼逐渐为血色笼罩。¤The moment I subconsciously gripped the hilt of the sword, my body's power was squeezed out of me. The injected aura seems like heavenly thunder stirring the fire, resonating with the will stirring inside the sword. The unrestrained anger filled your chest, and your eyes were gradually enveloped in blood.
可是剑身依然古井无波，与激昂的招式格格不入。¤But the sword body is still unwavering, and it doesn't fit in with the aggressive moves.
赤红的灵气缠绕着倪父的右臂，运剑轨迹古朴沉稳，仿佛将重逾千斤的铁锤使得虎虎生威。¤Crimson aura wrapped around Patriach Ni's right arm, the trajectory of his sword swing was simple and steady, yet each repeated swing displayed the vitality of a man whose strength was boundless.
（魏老，怎么办？）¤(Old Wei, what should I do?)
嘿嘿，你要是能认出这些人的实力，恐怕你就得腿软了。¤Hehe, if you could recognise the strength of these people, I'm afraid you'd be weak in the knees.
真正的本命法器，便是主人的灵魂映照，自然会对最熟悉的功法产生回应。¤A true native magic weapon is the reflection of the owner's soul, and will naturally respond to the most familiar Kung Fu method.
哪怕是寻常刀剑，日积月累，惯用的位置也会磨光。¤Even unusual swords, day after day, the usual spots will be worn out.
哦？这倒是蹊跷。我倪家于用剑之道颇为心得，可否借剑一看？¤Oh? This is strange. My Ni family has a lot of experience in the use of swords. Can I borrow the sword to see it?
剑意忽变，灵动跳脱的剑尖上下纷飞。周围草木随着他周身吞吐的灵气翩翩起舞。¤The intent of the sword suddenly changed, and the sharp tip of the sword flew up and down. The surrounding vegetation danced with the spirit of his body.
倪宗主缓步来到庭院中央，持剑肃立。¤Sect Master Ni walked slowly to the center of the courtyard, standing with a sword.
还未等你有所反应，迫在眉睫的剑尖却似深陷泥沼，踌躇不前。却听得倪家主闷哼一声，锈剑竟然挣脱了灵气束缚，悬在你的面前。¤Before you can react, the tip of the looming sword seems to be deep in the mire, hesitant. But I heard Patriarch Ni snorted, the rusty sword actually broke free of the aura binding, hanging in front of you.
（递出锈渍铁剑）¤(Hands out the rusty iron sword)
右手松开剑柄，古剑仅凭一道灵气托举。¤The right hand let go of the hilt and the ancient sword was held up by spiritual energy alone.
这...¤This...
还是过段时间再来吧。¤It's better to come back some time later.
你搜索四周，并没有发现成熟的药草。¤You search around and find no ripe herbs.
此地已没什么成熟的药草，我还是三年后再来吧。¤I'd better come back in three years.
这里面是良药园是只允许内门弟子进入的，我还是不要随便乱走了...¤This is the Garden of Good Medicine which only allows inner disciples to enter, so I'd better not wander around...
走到竹林深处，映入你眼帘的是一汪绿色的水潭。潭面没有一丝涟漪，平静的仿佛一块碧绿色的玉石。¤When you walk deep into the bamboo forest, what you see is a green pool of water. The surface of the pond does not have a ripple, calm as if a turquoise jade.
与这洋溢着平和之意的外表相反，潭水散发着砭人肌骨的寒意，你运转灵气尚可抵抗。¤Contrary to this overflowing with the appearance of peace, the pool water emits a bone-chilling coldness, you can still resist by running your spiritual energy.
这潭水有些蹊跷，竹山宗此地多有竹阵压制，这寒潭气息怎会如此之重。¤There is something strange about this pool, the Bamboo Mountain Sect has bamboo formations here to suppress it, how can this cold pool be so heavy.
你被这充盈着生机的翠色吸引，缓步来到潭水边。¤You are attracted by the vibrant emerald color and slowly step to the pool.
你飞速地采下阴凝草，随着灵药装入玉盒，潭水的寒意减轻了不少。¤You quickly gather up the Netherborn Grass, with the herb now in a jade box, the seeping cold of the pool begin to fade.
你咬紧牙关向那里游去，一株通体深紫边缘靛青的灵药在潭底的石缝中舒展叶片。¤You grit your teeth and swim towards it. An Pill with a deep purple body and indigo edges stretches its leaves in the rock crevices at the bottom of the pool.
竟然是阴凝草，你{xiaozi}这下真是走运了！看来正好赶上它步入成熟期，你且快快采摘免得被驻守此地的长老发现！¤What, it is a Netherborn Grass, you {xiaozi} are really in luck now! It seems to be just ripe, and you should pick it quickly before the elders stationed here find it!
越平静美丽的事物往往越危险，你决定还是远离这里为妙。¤The calmer and more beautiful things are often more dangerous, so you decide it's better to stay away from here.
随着一丝一缕的寒气纳入气海，你的经脉也得到了锻炼。¤With a wisp of cold Qi incorporated into the sea of Qi, your meridians are also exercised.
你找了一个合适的位置盘腿而坐，打算借助此地的寒气锻炼体魄。¤You find a suitable position to sit cross-legged, intending to exercise your body with the cold qi from this place.
你思索片刻，认为魏无极所言可信度不高。何况你本就不擅水性，何必以身试险。¤You think about it for a moment and think that Wei Wuji's words are not very credible. Besides, you are not good at water, why try to risk yourself.
就在你即将力竭折返时，一丝悚骨的极寒之气从不远处传来。¤The actual fact that you are about to turn back at the end of your strength, a trace of cold air came from not far away.
{xiaozi}，过去看看！¤The {xiaozi}, go over and take a look!
你思索片刻，认为魏无极所言在理，于是运气护体跳入寒潭，奋力向下潜去。¤You think about it for a moment, think Wei Wuji is right, so luck to protect the body jumped into the cold pool, and dive down hard.
与这洋溢着平和之意的外表相反，潭水散发着砭人肌骨的寒意，让你连灵气的运转都滞塞了许多。¤The actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who have been in the business for a long time, and you've got a lot of people who have been in the business for a long time.
我看凭你{xiaozi}现在的身体强度，到潭底一探应该不是什么难事。¤I see that with your {xiaozi} current physical strength, it should not be difficult to go to the bottom of the pool and explore.
要离开方壶山吗？¤Want to leave Fang Hu Mountain?
如果想要进入其中，必须得想些办法移开洞口的巨石，又不要弄出太大的动静才行。¤If you want to enter it, you have to think of some way to move the boulders at the mouth of the cave and not make too much noise to do so.
似乎有一种可去驱使物体移动的低阶法术能够做到这一点，但你并没有掌握。¤There seems to be a low-ranking spell that can drive objects to move that can do this, but you don't have it at your disposal.
似乎有一种能够切割物体的地阶法术能够做到这一点，但你并没有掌握。¤There seems to be a ground-level spell that can cut objects that can do this, but you don't master it.
你捏起法决，试图使用驱物术移动洞口的巨石。也许是你的修为太低，巨石只是微微摇晃，并没有被挪开。¤You squeeze up the spell and try to use the repel object spell to move the boulder at the entrance of the cave. Perhaps your cultivation level is too low, the boulder only slightly shakes, and is not moved away.
你捏起法决，巨石略微晃动了几下，便被你轻轻抬起，挪到了一边，露出了背后黑漆漆的洞窟。¤You squeeze up the spell, the boulder slightly swayed a few times, then you gently lift, moved to the side, revealing the dark cave behind.
你捏起法决，数道气刃划过，巨石瞬间便被切割成了小块，轰然解体，散落一地，露出了背后黑漆漆的洞窟。¤You squeeze up the spell, several blades of Qi cut through, the boulder was instantly cut into small pieces, disintegrated with a bang, scattered all over the place, revealing the black cave behind.
巨石倒塌的动静惊动了附近巡逻的竹山宗弟子。¤The commotion of the boulder collapsing alarmed the nearby patrolling Bamboo Mountain Sect disciples.
什么人？¤who?
{shidi}？你在这里做什么，怎么弄出这么大动静！¤{shidi}? What are you doing here, why did you make such a big noise!
你只好将自己方才所为一一道来...¤You had to tell us what you did...
原来如此...¤So that's it...
{shidi}，这方壶山内有我派金丹期长老坐阵，以后万不可如此莽撞。¤{shidi}，There are Golden Dan stage elders of our school sitting inside this Fang Hu Mountain, so you must not be so reckless in the future.
今日之事你就当没发生过，这里交给我来收拾，你若没有别的事便快快离开吧。¤The fact is that you can't be sure that you're going to be able to get the best out of this.
师...{shixiong}？发生什么事了么！¤The... What happened? What's going on?
你随便编出一个理由，便将这位师弟给打发走了。¤You just made up a random reason and sent this senior brother away.
只是我在练习法术，不小心弄出点动静罢了。¤It's just that I was practicing my spells and I accidentally made some noise.
你随便编出一个理由，师弟虽然有些不太相信的样子，还是被你给打发走了。¤You just made up a reason, although the junior brother did not quite believe the look, but still you sent away.
刚刚被一条阴鳞蟒给偷袭了，所以弄出些动静。¤I was just attacked by a Yin scale python, so I made some noise.
你凭空召唤出一道火焰照明，便走进了洞窟。¤You summoned a flame of light out of thin air and walked into the cave.
这里似乎曾经是某位修士修炼用的洞府，虽然已经破败不堪，但依稀能够看到当年所布阵法的痕迹。¤It seems that this place used to be the cave house used by a certain cultivator for cultivation. Although it has been dilapidated, you can vaguely see the traces of the formations deployed in the past.
地上只有一些散落的灵核与灵石，应该便是当年布阵所用，除此以外便没有其它的东西了。¤There are only a few scattered spiritual cores and spiritual stones on the ground, which should have been used for the formation of the formation back then, there is nothing more than that.
眼前似乎是一座早已废弃的洞府，洞窟的入口被坍塌的岩石与交织的藤蔓遮挡地严严实实，看不清里面的情况。¤The entrance to the cave is blocked by collapsed rocks and intertwined vines, so you can't see what's going on inside.
你远远地看到前方似乎有竹山宗的外门弟子在此戒备，你决定...¤You see from afar that there seems to be an outer disciple of the Bamboo Mountain Sect standing guard here, and you decide to...
你捏了一个法决，收敛气息，偷偷从阴暗处溜了过去，所幸并没有被发现。¤You squeeze a spell, converge your breath and sneak through the shadows, but fortunately you are not discovered.
你捏了一个法决，收敛气息，想要从阴暗处溜过去。但没走几步，便感觉一道冰冷的神识扫过...¤You squeezed a spell, collected your breath, and tried to sneak through the shadows. But before you take a few steps, you feel a cold soul sense sweep through...
你知晓前方似乎有竹山宗的外门弟子在此戒备，你决定绕开他们¤You know that there seems to be an outer disciple of the Bamboo Mountain Sect ahead of you, and you decide to go around them.
在此地巡逻的竹山宗弟子，对你点头示意。¤The Bamboo Mountain Sect disciple patrolling this area nods to you.
再往前便是方壶山矿脉了，但竹山宗亦派遣了不少门内弟子在此巡逻戒备，你决定...¤Further ahead is the Square Cauldron Mountain mine, but the Bamboo Mountain Sect has also sent many of its disciples to patrol the area.
竹山宗亦派遣了不少门内弟子在此巡逻戒备，你决定绕过他们。¤You decide to bypass them.
前方的山头似乎是宗门某位长老的洞府，但洞府外设有禁制，使你无法看清里面的情况...¤The hill ahead seems to be the cave of one of the sect's elders, but it is forbidden outside, so you cannot see the situation inside...
还是不要随意打扰前辈闭关了吧...¤It's better not to disturb the senior's retreat at will...
前方的山头似乎是竹山宗某位长老的洞府，但洞府外设有禁制，使你无法看清里面的情况...¤The hill ahead seems to be the cave of one of the elders of the Bamboo Mountain Sect, but there are prohibitions outside the cave so that you can't see inside...
没等你走上几步，洞府外的阵法突然运转起来，一股巨大的托力凭空出现，将你甩了出去...¤Before you can take a few steps, the formation outside the cave suddenly works, and a huge force appears out of nowhere, throwing you out...
你重重地摔在了地上，血量-10¤You fell heavily to the ground, blood -10
还是不要打扰化神前辈修炼为好…¤It would be better not to disturb the cultivation of the senior Deity Transformation...
还是不要打扰明山道友清修了…¤It's better not to disturb your spiritual training...
如无必要，还是莫要打扰人家清修为好...¤If you don't have to, don't disturb them...
你能感受到，洞府内有一股与你境界相仿的气息。¤You can feel that there is an aura within the cave that is similar to your realm.
神秘声音：想不到当年的金丹修士，如今也到了这般境界。¤Mysterious voice: I never thought that the Golden Dan cultivator back then would have reached this level today.
我便是明山散人，道友此次前来，所为何事？¤I am Ming Shanshou. What is the reason for your coming here?
哈哈，我也许久未曾论道了，道友有何疑惑，但说无妨！¤I haven't had a talk for a long time, so if you have any doubts, just say so!
早就知道阁下大名，因此化神之后特来拜会一番。¤I have known your name for a long time, so I have come to pay a visit to you after your Deity Transformation.
他这句话没有丝毫犹豫，你能感受到，他早已料想了这种情况。¤He said this without the slightest hesitation, and you could sense that he had anticipated this situation for a long time.
若威胁到了宗门，乃至整个宁州，我自当出手。¤If it threatens the clan, or indeed the whole of Ning Province, I will take action.
这金丹魔修你自不必理会，但若日后来了元婴，甚至化神魔修，你又当如何？¤Naturally, you don't need to pay much attention to this Golden Core evil cultivator, but if a Nascent Soul or even a Deity Transformation evil cultivator comes in the future, what will you do?
像你说的这种小事，宁州每天都有在发生，我等自不可能一一前去处理。¤Small things like what you're talking about happen every day in Ning Province, and it's impossible for us to go and deal with them all.
关于魔门之事，你怎么看？¤What do you think about the matter of the Devil's Gate?
你看他是魔道，他看你也是魔道，自古正邪之争无非也只是利益之争罢了。¤You see him as a devil, and he sees you as a devil. Since ancient times, the battle between good and evil has been nothing more than a battle of interests.
今宁州暗流涌动，魔门定然有所图谋。此前天魔道渗透方壶山，不过是小小的序曲罢了。¤There are dark currents in Ning Province today, and the Demon Sect must be planning something. The previous infiltration of Fang Hu Mountain by the Heavenly Demon Sect was just a small prelude.
原来如此。¤That's it.
在我看来，长生应该是追求其他目标的手段，而不是终点。¤In my view, long life should be a means to other goals, not an end in itself.
枯木最终化作了方壶山上的一棵树，从某种意义上来说也算是“长生”，可这真的是你想要的麽？¤The dead wood eventually turns into a tree on the hill of the square pots, which is in a sense long life, but is that really what you want?
我不认为只有长生才有意义。¤I don't think it only makes sense to live forever.
长生之道一直以来都是众多修行之人的目标，不知道友又是如何看待？¤The path to immortality has long been the goal of many practitioners, and I wonder how you feel about it?
个人的道法神通不同，机缘不同，由此而领悟的仙术也不尽相同，前人的经验未必就适合后人。¤Individuals have different Daoist divine abilities and different chances, and the resulting immortal arts they comprehend are also different, and the experience of previous generations may not be suitable for future generations.
但若能弄明白仙术之间的巧妙搭配，想必渡劫之时也能多几分把握吧。¤But if you can understand the clever combination of immortal arts, you will be able to have more control when you cross the tribulation.
我虽准备了这么多年，终究也只能窥得一丝天道罢了，谈不上什么心得。¤Although I have prepared for so many years, in the end I have only been able to glimpse a glimpse of the heavenly path, and I cannot speak of any insights.
关于渡劫一事，道友已经先我准备了数百年，可有经验心得相授？¤Regarding the transmigration, you have been preparing for it for hundreds of years before me, do you have any experience and insights to teach me?
多谢。¤Thanks a lot.
在思绪与欣喜中，你最终还是道别离开了。¤In the midst of your thoughts and elation, you finally said goodbye and left.
又进行了一番论道后，你二人各有收获。¤After some more discourses, you two have each gained something.
{FirstName}{shidi}？今日来找我何事？¤{FirstName}{shidi}? What did you come to see me about today?
{FirstName}道友？今日来找我何事？¤{FirstName}Daoist? What do you wish to see me about today?
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来邀请明山道友届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to invite Fellow Daoist Ming Shan to come and observe the ceremony at that time.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来邀请明山师兄届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to invite Senior Brother Mingshan to attend the ceremony at that time.
明山随手将请帖接过，看过之后却陷入了沉思。¤Ming Shan casually took the invitation and read it, but afterwards fell into a pensive mood.
你将请帖从储物袋中取出，并通过以灵气御物将其递送过去。¤You take the invitation out of your storage pouch and deliver it by using your Spiritual Qi.
麻烦{FirstName}道友回告白帝，待我准备妥当便会前往白帝楼一叙。¤I apologize fellow Daoist {FirstName} but could I trouble you to tell the White Emperor that I will go to his pavilion for a chat only when I am good and ready.
嗯...竟还有此等计划...只是恐怕有些不太好收场...¤Hmm... So it seems there plans in place... Only i'm afraid it's not going to end well...
也罢，近年来这些魔门行事愈发猖狂，若这次又让他们得逞，难免助长他们的嚣张气焰。¤Fine, But for the past few years these Demonic Sect's actions have become more and more heinous, If we let them get away with it again this time, it will only fuel their arrogance.
麻烦{FirstName}{shidi}回告白帝，待我准备妥当便会前往白帝楼一叙。¤Please {FirstName}{shidi} tell the White Emperor that I will go to the White Emperor's House when I am ready.
多谢明山道友，那我这便告辞了。¤Thank you, Fellow Daoist Ming Shan, then I will take my leave now.
多谢明山师兄，那我这便告辞了。¤Thank you, Brother Mingshan, then I will take my leave now.
多谢明山前辈，那我这便告辞了。¤Thank you, Elder Ming Shan, then I will take my leave now.
麻烦{FirstName}小友回告白帝，待我准备妥当便会前往白帝楼一叙。¤Apologies {FirstName} my friend but could I trouble you to tell the White Emperor that I will go to his pavilion for a chat when I am good and ready.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来邀请明山前辈届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to invite Elder Ming Shan to come and observe the ceremony at that time.
{FirstName}小友？今日来找我何事？¤{FirstName}, my friend? What do wish to discuss with me about today?
这里是竹山宗的药园，要采摘这里的灵药么？{w}{w=0.5}¤This is the medicinal garden of the Bamboo Mountain Sect, do you want to pick the spiritual herbs here? {w}{w=0.5}
这里是竹山宗的矿脉，要在这里采集材料吗？{w}{w=0.5}¤This is the Bamboo Mountain Clan's mine vein, are you going to collect materials here? {w}{w=0.5}
咳咳，还撑得住，师妹...我们快到宗门了吗？¤Ahem, I can hold it, Junior Sister...Are we almost at the sect?
前方隐隐有说话声传入你的耳朵，你连忙屏气凝神，躲到一旁的草丛。¤There was a faint voice coming into your ears from the front, and you quickly held your breath and hid in the bushes aside.
师兄，您的伤不要紧吧！¤Brother, your injury does not matter!
师兄放心，我们已经到了方壶山，他们不敢追来。¤Senior brother, don't worry, we have reached Square Cauldron Mountain, they dare not chase after.
这就好，这次能夺下这件宝贝，也算是不虚此行...你这次回到宗门，可不要...¤That's good, it's a worthwhile trip to take this treasure this time... You go back to the sect this time, don't you...
嘘！师兄，别说了，你还是先休息一会儿吧！¤Hush! Brother, don't say anything, you should rest for a while!
这两人穿的是竹山宗的服饰，也不知遇到了什么事，竟然如此狼狈，我是否应该现身相助？¤The two people are wearing the costumes of the Bamboo Mountain Sect. I don't know what happened to them. They are so embarrassed. Should I show up to help?
这两人看是我竹山宗中人，也不知遇到了什么事，竟然如此狼狈，我是否应该现身相助？¤These two look like they are from my Bamboo Mountain Clan, and I don't know what has happened to them, they are in such a mess, should I show up to help?
谁！？¤Who!
师兄，师姐，我也是竹山宗内弟子。发生什么事了，你们是被何人所伤？¤Senior brother, senior sister, I am also a disciple within the Bamboo Mountain Sect. What happened, and by whom were you injured?
二位道友，在下不过路过此地。发生什么事了，你们是被何人所伤？¤Fellow Daoists, I was just passing by here. What happened? Who hurt you?
小心身后！¤Be careful behind!
正当你觉得奇怪之时，身后剑声已至，你低头一看，一柄利剑已经穿透了你的胸膛，鲜血顺着剑尖往下流淌...¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're getting into.
女子突然大叫一声，你吓了一跳，连忙转身戒备，然而眼前却空无一物。¤The woman suddenly shouted, you were startled, and quickly turned around to guard, however, there was nothing in front of you.
师兄，你不用白费力气了，以你现在的功力，是挣脱不了我这奎木索的。¤Brother, you don't have to waste your energy. With your current skill, you can't get rid of my Quemuso.
{vpunch=10,0.5}啊！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Ah!
师妹...你暗算我...为什么？¤Junior Sister...you trick me...why?
好，算……算我走眼了，你一个人想独吞宝物？¤Okay, forget it... Forget it, you want to swallow the treasure alone?
师兄，看在往日的情份上，我会留你一具全尸的。¤Brother, for the sake of the past, I will keep you a whole body.
师妹，看在往日师兄待你不薄的份上……¤Junior sister, for the good old brothers treated you...
啊！¤Ah!
眼前的女子丝毫不为所动，血花飞溅，只见那名竹山宗师兄的胸口已经被利剑穿透，应该是活不成了...¤The woman in front of her was unmoved, blood splattered, and saw that Senior Brother Bamboo Mountain Sect's chest had been pierced by a sharp sword, she should not be able to survive...
（也不知是什么法宝这么有吸引力，竟可以令她冒天下之大不韪残害同门师兄...）¤(I don't know what magic weapon is so attractive, which can make her risk the world's bad faith and brutalize her fellow brother...)
你不敢出声，待得女子处理完尸体离开以后，你又躲到了晚上，这才偷偷现身，逃离了此地。¤You didn't dare to speak out. After the woman had processed the body and left, you hid again into the night, then secretly appeared and fled here.
{xiaozi}，这丫头不似善类，你小心行事。¤{xiaozi}, this girl is not like a good type, you act carefully.
你看到对方向你袭来。¤You see the opponent coming at you.
你！！¤You!!!
此地已没什么成熟的药草，我还是五年后再来吧。¤There are no more mature herbs in this place, so I'd better come back in five years.
远远望去，已经能够看到竹山宗在方壶山开辟的药田。但竹山宗也在此设立了执事堂，想要偷偷溜过去似乎不太容易。¤Looking from afar, I can already see the medicinal fields that the Bamboo Mountain Sect has set up on Fang Hu Mountain. But the Bamboo Mountain Sect has also set up a Deacon Hall here, so it doesn't seem easy to sneak past.
嗯？有人闯入？¤Hmm? Someone broke in?
道友，请留步。¤Friends, please stay.
快，有人闯入！¤Quick, someone's breaking in!
方壶山临近竹山宗，我还是不要多做逗留为好。¤Fang Hu Mountain is close to the Bamboo Mountain Sect, so I'd better not linger too much.
是否要前往方壶山执事堂？¤Should I head to Fang Hu Mountain Deacon Hall?
眼前剩下的唯有一块灵力消散的石碑。¤All that was left in front of him was a stone tablet whose spiritual power had dissipated.
眼前的阵法已然荒废，唯有一颗石头浮于空中。¤The formation in front of him has been abandoned, and only a stone floats in the air.
这就是龙魂石了吧，这阵眼的龙须藤、龙血草也不能浪费了。¤This is the Dragon Soul Stone, and the dragon's vine and dragon's blood grass cannot be wasted.
此处的定海碑已被你取走。¤The Dinghai tablet here has been taken by you.
眼前是一块完好的定海碑。¤In front of him is a complete Dinghai monument.
白帝楼来人？¤The White Emperor Manor from people?
没想到白帝楼所托之人，居然还是我门中人。¤I didn't expect the person entrusted by the White Emperor House to be a member of our Sect.
你将东西给他。他接过储物袋神识一扫。¤You will give him the stuff. He took the storage bag soul sense a sweep.
嗯，没有问题，这是火麟玉。¤Well, there is no problem, this is the fire forest jade.
告辞。¤Farewell.
小子，把东西留下。¤Kid, leave the stuff.
什么东西，你是谁？（果然有问题，我这还没出沃焦山，对方就来了？）¤What is it, who are you? (There's really something wrong, I haven't even left Wogao Mountain yet, and the other side is here?
不要装傻，火麟玉留下！！¤Don't play dumb, leave the fire jade!
前辈，此人乃是魔教妖人，请您助晚辈一臂之力。¤Senior, this person is a demon of the demon sect, please help me.
嗯？有埋伏！！？？¤Huh? There is an ambush!!!?
{xiaozi}，你敢唬我！！！拿命来！¤{xiaozi}, you dare to bluff me!!! I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
魔教妖人拿命来！¤The demons of the Demon Cult are coming!
离火门亦派遣了不少门内弟子在此巡逻戒备，你决定绕过他们。¤The Heavenly Fire Gate has also sent many of its disciples to patrol and guard here, so you decide to bypass them.
再往前便是沃焦山火山口了，但离火门亦派遣了不少门内弟子在此巡逻戒备，你决定...¤The crater of Mount Inferno is just a few steps away, but the Heavenly Fire Gate has sent many of its disciples to patrol and guard the area, so decide...
在此地巡逻的离火门弟子，对你点头示意。¤A disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate patrolling this place nods to you.
这里就是火铜矿脉了，李道友动作快些免得被发现！¤This is the fire copper vein, so move quickly before you are discovered!
李相书从袖内掏出一块泛着寒气的白玉，灼热的气浪在白玉四周迅速凝结而又被冻成细小的冰晶，你不由啧啧称奇。¤Li Xiangshu pulled out a piece of white jade from his sleeve with cold air, burning heat waves around the white jade quickly condensed and frozen into tiny ice crystals, you can not help but tsk.
他举着玉小心翼翼靠近铜矿的每个角落，谨慎地确认有无异样。¤He held up the jade carefully close to each corner of the copper mine, cautiously to confirm that there is no difference.
“这么长时间都没结果，我看《本草纲目》记载的八成不会错。”¤So long without results, I see that 80% of what is recorded in the Materia Medica is not wrong.
道友，时候不早了，你我二人还是尽早离开吧！¤Fellow Daoist, it's getting late, you and I should leave as soon as possible!
看来这宁州香薷确实灭绝了...唉，可怜我师妹的性命......¤It seems that this Ning Province Elsholtzia is indeed extinct... I pity my sister's life ......
你走上前去，稍作用力地拍了下李相书的肩膀。¤You walked up and gave Li Xiangshu's shoulder a little bit of force.
哎呦！！！¤The actual fact is that you are able to get a lot more than just a few of the most popular and most popular.
他被吓了一跳，手中的寒玉一个不稳滚落地面，落进矿丛中不见踪影。¤He was startled, the cold jade in his hand an unstable rolled off the ground and fell into the mine bush out of sight.
这我可不是故意的，只是想提醒你快些离开。¤This I did not mean to do, just to remind you to leave quickly.
无碍，我们还是......¤No hindrance, we still ......
李相书的话戛然截止，瞪大眼睛惊异地看向你的身后。¤Li Xiang Shu words abruptly cut off, wide-eyed amazement to look behind you.
怎么了......？¤What's wrong ......?
两位仙长缘何打扰小女静修？¤Two immortal elder edge why disturb the little girl meditation?
你循声望去，一紫衣女子脸似桃花放蕊，身如弱柳迎风。翩翩纱衣无风自摆，纤纤玉指呈兰花状轻捏着方\r才不知掉落何处的寒玉，好一副娉婷妩媚我见犹怜的姿态。¤You look at the sound, a woman in purple face like a peach blossom put pistil, body like a weak willow to welcome the wind. Fluttering gauze without wind from the swing, slender jade fingers in the shape of an orchid lightly pinched Fang \r just do not know where to drop the cold jade, a good pair of graceful and charming I see the pity of the posture.
宁宁宁......宁州香薷！宁州香薷化形了？？？¤Ning Ning Ning ...... The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're doing.
说来话长，在下师妹诡毒侵体，实需宁州香薷入药。万般无奈之下叨扰姑娘修行，望姑娘千万海涵。¤It's a long story. My sister's body is infested with a strange poison and she needs the Ning Province medicine Elsholtzia. I hope you will bear with me as I have no choice but to disturb your practice.
仙长若不介意，可唤小女宁紫馨，宁州香薷正是小女本源。不知二位寻求此草所为何事？¤If you don't mind, you can call my daughter Ning Zixin, who is the origin of Ning Province Elsholtzia. I don't know what you are looking for in this herb.
女子闻言娇柔神色中闪过一丝精芒，但仍粉面含春地笑道。¤The woman's delicate expression flashed with a hint of essence, but still smiled with a pink face.
仙长有如此情谊，小女欣羡不已。草药易得，有情郎难求。你不妨靠近些，小女这便分些花叶予仙长。¤The immortal has such friendship, my daughter is envious. Herbs are easy to get, but a lover is hard to find. You may come closer, I will distribute some flowers and leaves to the immortal.
多谢姑娘！¤Thank you, Miss!
李相书正将上前，你忽的瞥见宁紫馨面含嗔意，显得一张脸愈发阴狠凶戾。再看去时她神色如常，依旧唇边带笑。¤Li Xiangshu was about to go forward, you suddenly glanced at Ning Zixin face with anger, appearing a face more and more sinister and fierce. When you look again, she looks as usual, still with a smile on her lips.
一道精纯的火系灵气在宁紫馨掌中凝聚，看起来不像是凝聚本体，倒像是......¤A pure fire aura in the palm of Ning Zixin condensed, it does not look like the condensation of the body, but rather like ......
小心！！！¤Watch out!!!
待你意识到情况不对之际为时已晚，宁紫馨的法术重重打在李相书身上，将他击飞出去。¤By the time you realize that something is wrong, it is too late, Ning Zixin's spell hit Li Xiangshu hard and sent him flying out.
你飞速上前查看李相书的伤势，好在他也有所提防及时运起护体功法，才幸免于难。¤You quickly went forward to check the injury of Li Xiang Shu, but he was also prepared to use his body protection in time, so he was spared.
你隐隐发觉宁紫馨的恶意，以迅雷之势将李相书拉至身后，一颗巨大的火球与他擦身而过，将他的袖子烧去大半。¤You vaguely sensed Ning Zixin's malice and pulled Li Xianshu behind you with the speed of lightning, a huge fireball brushed against him and burned most of his sleeve away.
明面示好背后捅刀！不过是求取几叶草药而已，夺人性命未免也太过心狠手辣！¤The open face of goodwill stabbing knife in the back! But just to get a few leaves of herbs, taking lives is too ruthless!
管你劳什子歹毒心肠，我偏要杀又如何？¤I don't care what your heart is, I want to kill it, so what?
莫说几片，一片、半片我也不会给！就算修为尽散灰飞烟灭，你们人修也别想从我这带走一枝一叶！¤Not to mention a few leaves, I will not give even one or half a leaf! Even if your cultivation is destroyed, you human cultivators will not be able to take away a single leaf from me!
伤的就是你们这些道貌岸然的人修！不仅要伤，我还要杀呢！¤It is you who will be hurt, you moralistic human cultivators! Not only do I want to hurt, I want to kill!
我看她倒不像苦大仇深，根本是穷凶恶极！道友何必再与她浪费口舌，纳命来！¤She doesn't look like a bitter, vicious person to me! Why do you have to waste your words with her?
“她对人修貌似积怨颇深...到底是怎么一回事？”¤She seems to have a deep grudge against human cultivators... What's going on?
哼！五百年前灭族之仇镌骨铭心，我如何不苦大！如何不仇深！¤Hmph! How can I not be bitter about the revenge that destroyed my family 500 years ago? How can I not have a deep hatred?
凡是人族我皆不放过！看招！¤I will not spare any human race! Watch out!
人修果然狡诈，我且问你，倘若天地间只剩你一人，那也称得上人族尚存吗？¤I ask you, if you are the only one left in the world, can you still call yourself a human being?
投机取巧！贫嘴滑舌！话不投机半句多，不如拔剑！¤You're a speculator! You're a slick talker! If you don't want to talk, why don't you draw your sword?
你倒是能言善辩，可惜再伶俐也活不过今日！¤You are very eloquent, but it's a pity that you won't live to see the day!
姑娘此言差矣，只剩我一个，那我便是希望，如若连我也不剩才是最坏的情况。¤If I am the only one left, then I am the hope, but if I am not left, that is the worst case scenario.
听说几日前执事堂打死了个妄图用寒玉破坏火铜矿脉的阴险之徒，真是为人不齿。¤I heard that a few days ago the Deacon Hall killed a sinister person who tried to use cold jade to destroy the fire copper veins, really disgraceful.
据我一师弟言那厮不但不伏诛，还口口声声否认，说自己来找什么{color=#d0380a}宁州香薷{/color}。可笑，沃焦山哪里有这种草药！¤According to my junior brother, that guy not only refused to punish him, but also kept denying it, saying that he was looking for {color=#d0380a}Ning Province Xiangru{/color}. Ridiculous, where is this kind of herbal medicine in Wojiao Mountain!
像是感应到了什么，你怀中的玉简突然闪烁起来。¤Like sensing something, the jade brief in your arms suddenly flickered up.
但此处属离火门管辖，必须处处小心提防被发现才行。¤However, this place is under the jurisdiction of the Heavenly Fire Gate, so we must be careful everywhere to prevent being discovered.
一条岔路出现在你面前，正当你陷入两难时玉简再度亮起。上面的文字渐渐隐去，浮现出新的提示。¤A fork in the road appears in front of you, just as you are caught in a dilemma when the jade slip lights up again. The text on it fades away and a new hint emerges.
“{color=#d0380a}燕子空中上下飞{/color}”......莫非是在指引我方向吗？\n¤{color=#d0380a}The swallow flies up and down in the air{/color}...... Could it be guiding me in the direction? \n
原来如此！火山...沃焦山就是座火山啊！看来这里一定有什么不为人知的秘密。¤So that's it! A volcano... Mount Vogio is a volcano! It seems there must be some unknown secret here.
要在这里采集材料吗？{w}{w=0.5}¤Want to collect materials here? {w}{w=0.5}
要离开沃焦山吗？¤Should I leave Mount Vogio?
你感受到玉简的震动，将它掏了出来。似是受此地热浪的影响，那玉简竟化成一道白烟直接消散了，你不由得大吃一惊。¤You feel the vibration of the jade slip and pull it out. Seems to be affected by the heat wave here, that jade brief actually turned into a white smoke directly dissipated, you can not help but be amazed.
快躲起来，这东西应该是什么信号，有人来了！¤Quickly hide, this thing should be a signal of something, someone is coming!
听了魏无极的话你来不及多想，一个侧身钻进成堆的山石里。¤Listened to Wei Wuji words you can not think much, a sideways into the pile of rocks.
奇怪，明明感应到了玉简的气息，那小子跑哪去了？¤Strange, clearly sensed the breath of the jade brief, where did that kid run?
说完这句话，突然出现的黑袍男子又消失在你的视线里，大概是离开了。¤After saying this, the sudden appearance of the black-robed man disappeared again in your line of sight, probably left.
我就说怎么没看到墨居仁那小子，原来玉简在你这厮手上。既然如此也别怪我心狠手辣，怨只怨你自己好奇心作祟！¤I said how I did not see Mo Juren that kid, the original jade brief in your hands. In that case, do not blame me for being ruthless, blame only your own curiosity to blame!
此事有蹊跷，这黑袍人看起来并非离火门所属。当下也不知他是否真正离去，贸然行动恐怕不妥。¤There is something strange about this matter, this black-robed man does not seem to be a member of the Heavenly Fire Gate. At the moment, I do not know whether he really left, I am afraid that rash action is not appropriate.
放心，我可不会让你送死，到时候会{color=#d0380a}有人{/color}助你的。¤Don't worry, I won't let you get killed, when the time comes, there will {color=#d0380a} be someone {/color} to help you.
老头，你能感应到刚才那黑袍人的踪迹吗？¤Old man, can you sense the trail of the black-robed man just now?
{color=#d0380a}墨居仁{/color}那厮到底跑到哪里去了，莫不是在耍我？待我感应一下玉简位置！¤{color=#d0380a}Mo Juren{/color}Where the hell did that guy go, isn't he playing a trick on me? I will sense the location of the jade slip!
他藏匿功法用得极为精妙，我也难以确定，你不若再等上一等。¤He used the hiding technique extremely exquisite, I also difficult to determine, you do not wait a little longer.
不好！玉简早烟消云散了，他这一施术我必定遭殃！¤No! The jade tablet has long since disappeared, I'm sure I'll suffer if he does this!
千钧一发之际，一位身着离火门服饰的修士匆忙赶了过来。¤In the nick of time, a cultivator dressed in the uniform of the Heavenly Fire Gate hurried over.
此事有蹊跷，这黑袍人看起来并非本门所属。当下也不知他是否真正离去，贸然行动恐怕不妥。¤There is something strange about this matter, this black-robed man does not seem to belong to this sect. I don't know if he really left, so I'm afraid it's not a good idea to act rashly.
原来你在这，消息我打探清楚了，这就是送往{color=#d0380a}灵庙{/color}的物资清单。¤So you are here, the news I poked around, this is the list of supplies sent to the {color=#d0380a} Spirit Temple{/color}.
哦，果然不出{color=#d0380a}教主{/color}所料，{color=#d0380a}老妖怪{/color}要飞升了。¤Oh, it's true what {color=#d0380a}the godfather{/color} expected, {color=#d0380a}the old demon{/color}is going to ascend.
延寿的丹药呢？快给我！从此我们再无关系！¤Where is the Pill for life extension? Give it to me quickly! From now on we are no longer related!
他就是墨居仁？难不成这离火门弟子是与外教勾结构陷自己的宗门？¤He is Mo Juren? It's hard to believe that this disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate is colluding with a foreign sect to frame his own sect?
墨居仁？本门弟子竟有人与外人勾结？¤Mo Juren? How can someone from our sect collude with outsiders?
哼，你是在命令我？¤Are you ordering me around?
你们答应帮我补齐修习魔焰决所造成的亏空的，难道你们要反悔？¤You promised to help me make up for the deficit caused by the Magic Flame Duel, are you going to renege?
这是不假，但你不会真的天真到以为弄个清单就能换取这么庞大的资源吧。¤It's true, but you're not really naive enough to think that you can get a list in exchange for such a huge amount of resources.
你们说过，只要一个清单足矣！我是不会再听你摆布，做出违背宗门之事的！¤You have said that a list is enough! I am not going to listen to your manipulation and do something against the sect again!
魔焰决......坊市传言这功法修炼起来自损寿元，竟然是真的。¤Devil Flame Duel ...... The rumor in the market that this technique cultivates itself to lose life is actually true.
魔焰决......这本是魔焰真君创此功法，为解决自身资质较低无法修炼的问题，但终不是每个人都如他老人家一般，能够修为精进突破境界弥补寿元啊。¤Magic Flame Duel ...... This is the true monarch of the Devil's Flame created this technique to solve the problem of their own low qualifications can not be cultivated, but ultimately not everyone is like his old man general, can cultivate to break through the realm to make up for the longevity ah.
你听到兴头正欲凑近些，不料脚下碎石因动作发出轻微声响，一下惊动了正在谈话的二人。¤You hear the head is trying to get closer, but unexpectedly underfoot gravel because of the action issued a slight sound, a startled the two are talking.
到此为止吧，看来有杂鱼混进来了。我不便出手，你去料理了他。¤To this end, it seems that there are miscellaneous fish mixed in. I'm not in a position to do anything, you go and take care of him.
那你们答应我的......¤Then you promised me ......
下个月我自会联络你。¤I will contact you next month.
说话算话！¤I will contact you next month.
言罢，墨居仁径直向你走来。¤After the words, Mo Juren walked straight towards you.
你看准时机，趁着神秘人消失而墨居仁没靠近的一瞬提气轻身，拔腿便跑。所幸平日没少苦修身法，总算逃出了墨居仁的追踪。¤You see the right time, take advantage of the moment when the mysterious person disappeared and Mo Juren didn't get close, lifted up your breath and ran away. Fortunately, I didn't work hard to cultivate myself, and finally escaped Mo Juren's tracking.
此人似乎是绝焰堂的执事之一，看来此事另有隐情。¤This person seems to be one of the deacons of the Absolute Flame Hall, it seems that there is another hidden agenda in this matter.
呵呵，现在又想做好人了？¤Now you want to be a good person again?
可惜你没机会了，算算时间也差不多了，你内视一番。¤Unfortunately, you don't have a chance. It's about time for you to take an internal look.
你们对我做了什么？嗯？这是！！？？蛊？¤What have you done to me? Hmm? This is!!!? Compulsion?
他好像很痛苦的样子。¤He seems to be in a lot of pain.
呼呼......你们是{color=#d0380a}古神教{/color}的人？这是{color=#d0380a}魔神蛊{/color}？¤Hoo hoo ...... You are from the {color=#d0380a}Ancient God Cult{/color}? Is this the {color=#d0380a}Devil God Compulsion{/color}?
哈哈哈！中了我教神蛊，你还不乖乖听话！！¤Hahahaha! You are still not obedient after being hit by my religion's divine compulsion!!!
哦？你个小小的执事倒是有点见识。我承诺你的句句属实，我教《古神经》配合神蛊，区区魔焰决的弊端又有何妨？¤Oh? You're a little deacon with some insight. I promise you everything is true, I teach Ancient Nerve with the divine compulsion, what's the harm of a mere demonic flame duel?
我所要的解决办法，可不是变成你们古神教这些不人不魔的疯子！！！¤The solution I want is not to become a madman of the Ancient Gods!
麒麟火玉乃是门中重要物资，每次运输至少有金丹期高手坐镇，我怎么可能动手脚？¤The Qilin fire jade is an important material in the door, each transport at least jindan stage experts to sit down, how can I do something?
呵呵呵，你痛苦的样子真的很不错！所以这次的无礼我原谅你了。¤You look really good in pain! So I forgive you for your rudeness this time.
只要你帮我办事，此间事了，我便收你为徒入教。若是修炼有成，区区寿元亏空又算得了什么？¤As long as you help me, I will accept you as a disciple into the sect once this is over. If you are successful in your training, what is a mere shortage of life expectancy?
再者，现在后悔已经迟了。难道你最近没有感受到肉身正在被神蛊改变吗？事情办好了，我就传你《古神经》第一层。¤Moreover, it is too late to regret. Have you not felt your body being changed by the divine compulsion recently? After this is done, I will pass on the first layer of Ancient Nerve to you.
{vpunch=10,0.5}......呃啊！！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}...... Uhhhh!!!
呼......你...你还要需要我做什么？¤Hoo ...... You... What else do you need me to do?
离火门灵庙的{color=#d0380a}麒麟火玉{/color}，要经由你们绝焰堂之手运往各处，到时候你将我上次给的{color=#d0380a}东西{/color}找机会淋在上面。¤The {color=#d0380a}kylin fire jade{/color} from the Spirit Temple of the Heavenly Fire Gate is to be transported to various places through the hands of your Absolute Flame Hall, so when the time comes, you will find an opportunity to shower the {color=#d0380a} stuff{/color} I gave last time on it.
怪不得此人对我离火门知之甚详，原来内鬼不止一人。¤No wonder this person knows a lot about my Heavenly Fire Gate, it turns out there is more than one mole.
对了，帮我通过你们绝焰堂查查这两个人，在宁州的踪迹？¤By the way, help me check these two people through your Absolute Flame Hall, in Ning Province traces?
他们是？¤They are?
不该问的别问。¤Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.
糟了！¤Damn!
哦？是同门{shidi}？离火门可没有叫人听墙角的功法，{shidi}若执意修炼也只好留下性命了！¤Oh? It's a fellow {shidi}? Heavenly Fire Gate does not have the ability to tell people to listen to the wall, {shidi} if they insist on practicing it, they have to leave their lives behind!
（好像得知了不得了的消息，现在该......）¤(It seems to have learned the most important news, now the ......)
此事牵扯甚广，我还是不要乱来了。¤This matter is very involved, I'd better not mess with it.
该交代的都交代完了，玉简拿好，下个月我还会联络你。¤The explanation is finished, take the jade brief, next month I will contact you.
好机会！趁其不意抢占先机，将他捉拿后禀告长老！¤Good opportunity! Seize the opportunity before it's too late, capture him and report to the elders!
黑袍男子身形逐渐隐去，只留下墨居仁一人站在原地。¤The black-robed man's figure gradually faded away, leaving Mo Juren standing alone in the same place.
魔焰决......这功法以燃烧寿元为代价，提高修炼速度。我也得早做打算了。¤Devil Flame Duel ...... This technique increases the speed of cultivation at the cost of burning longevity. I also have to make plans early.
{shidi}，我也是迫不得已。¤{shidi}, I had no choice but to do so.
何人鬼鬼祟祟，还不速度现行！¤Who is sneaky, still not speed current!
炸雷似的声音在你身边响起，你被吓了一跳，顿时愣在原地不敢吭声。回过神来，一位身着离火道袍的金丹修士面有怒色地站在你面前。¤Thunderclap-like voice rang out beside you, you were startled, suddenly froze in place and did not dare to say anything. Looking back, a Golden Core cultivator wearing a Heavenly Fire Gate Robe stood in front of you with an angry face.
小辈出于好奇深入至此，望前辈宽容，日后定不再犯！¤Junior out of curiosity deep into this, hope that the senior forgiveness, will not repeat the crime!
罢了，此次便饶你一命，可记住你方才的誓言。¤Just, this time will spare your life, but remember your oath.
你这老头啰哩吧嗦地使人厌烦，哪来那么多话，要打就打！¤You're a long-winded old man, you're tiresome, where are the words?
我还是不要多做逗留了。¤I'd better not stay any longer.
是否要前往沃焦山执事堂？¤Shall we go to the Deacon Hall of Mount Wogyo?
要在这里采集材料吗？¤Do you want to collect materials here?
离火门亦派遣了不少门内弟子在此巡逻戒备，你决定...¤The Heavenly Fire Gate has also sent many of its disciples to patrol and guard the area, so you decide...
你忍着硫磺刺鼻的气味登上山顶，脚下不远处的环形坑洞中赤红色岩浆上下翻腾。¤You bear the pungent smell of sulfur and climb to the top of the mountain. The crimson magma is churning up and down in the circular pit not far below your feet.
唰啦——¤Swish-la-
几颗石子因为你的动作滚向火山口，还没接触到岩浆就化为飞灰不见了。¤A few rocks roll toward the crater because of your movements, and before they touch the lava they turn into flying ash and disappear.
怎么样，敢跳吗？¤How about it, dare to jump?
什么？¤What?
跳进岩浆里？你疯了还是我疯了？老头，我扪心自问没做过什么对不起你的事吧？¤Jump into the lava? Are you crazy or am I crazy? Old man, I ask myself I have not done anything wrong to you, right?
害死你对我有什么好处？这岩浆下面似乎有着什么，之后弄个{color=#d0380a}辟火的法宝{/color}下去探查一番。¤What good would it do me to kill you? This lava seems to have something underneath, after getting a {color=#d0380a} fireproof magic treasure {/color} down to explore some.
小子，没有辟火宝物，你疯啦！！！？？？¤The kid, there is no fire-resistant treasures, you crazy!
你把心一横，闭上眼睛纵身一跃。¤You put your heart in the right place, close your eyes and leap.
剧烈而炽热的风从耳旁刮过，一阵失重感过后外界喧嚣的声响被隔绝开去。¤The fierce and hot wind blowing past your ears, a sense of weightlessness after the noise of the outside world was isolated.
小子，把眼睛睁开吧。¤Kid, open your eyes.
因为麒麟玉的功效你没有感到灼热，像是在海水中遨游一样，但围绕着你的却是绚烂的红色。¤Because of the effect of the unicorn jade you do not feel the heat, as if swimming in the sea, but around you is a brilliant red.
你尝试着舒展身体，却感到明显的粘滞感。看来在岩浆里自由行动并没有想象的那么轻松，你只好运起功法\r\n向前游去。¤You try to stretch your body, but you feel a distinct feeling of stickiness. It seems that moving freely in the lava is not as easy as you thought, so you have to use your kung fu \r\n to swim forward.
就在下方！过去看看！¤It's just below! Go over and check it out!
岩浆滞着的感觉让你非常不适，只好加快速度朝着魏无极指示的方向前进以减轻这种煎熬。¤The feeling of lava stagnation makes you very uncomfortable, so you have to speed up in the direction Wei Wuji indicated to alleviate this torment.
待光消散而去，一方小小的朴素石牌落入你手心。¤When the light dissipates and goes away, a small plain stone plaque falls into your hand.
不知向下深入了多少米，你的视线隐约捕捉到一个金色光团。气凝于章，你轻轻一吸，将那光团攫取过来。¤Not knowing how many meters down, your vision vaguely catches a golden ball of light. Qi condensed in the chapter, you gently sucked, will that light group seized over.
你就是让我来岩浆下面捞这个？¤You are asking me to come under the lava to get this?
失误，失误。方才被这玩意的气息干扰了判断，你这回朝着南方上去一定不会错。¤Mistake, mistake. Fang was the breath of this thing interfered with the judgment, you will not be wrong to go up towards the south this time.
害死你对我有什么好处？这岩浆下面似乎有着什么，你对火之道的领悟达到了{color=#d0380a}融会贯通{/color}即使没有辟火法宝也能下去探查一番。¤What's in it for me to kill you? This lava seems to have something underneath, your comprehension of the way of fire has reached {color=#d0380a} integration {/color} even without the fire magic treasure can also go down to explore some.
老夫这次肯定没搞错。¤The old man was certainly not mistaken this time.
你整理了一下情绪，一边向着新的方向进发一边阅读起石牌上的文字。¤You gather your emotions and read up the text on the stone plaque while heading in a new direction.
不如这样，{xiaozi}。你再往我说的方向找找，反正我们也都是要上去的，然后路上一齐看看这块石牌写了什么。¤How about this, {xiaozi}. You look in the direction I said again, we're all going up there anyway, and then on the way together we'll see what this stone sign says.
告罪书......告罪？¤Confession of guilt ...... Confession of guilt?
经过时间的磨砺，刻上去的部分文字已经变得模糊不清，你解读起来十分吃力，只能凭借上下文揣测笔者的意图。¤After the wear and tear of time, some of the words carved on it have become blurred, and you have a great deal of trouble deciphering it, and can only guess the author's intent by virtue of the context.
我...失误...导致阵心...毁，实在无颜面...宗门。灵气溃...破阵出，沃焦山一带...作焦土，生灵涂炭。¤I... Blunder... Resulting in the formation of the heart ... Destroyed, really have no face... clan. Aura collapse... Broken formation out, the area of Wogao Mountain... Scorched earth, the spirit of life.
看样子沃焦山以前曾经发生过事故......？¤It looks like there has been an accident in the past on Wogao Mountain ......?
故此留书...封，若后...传达，某感激不尽。¤So leave a book... If you want to tell me about it after... Convey, a grateful.
正在思考时你发觉周围的空间似乎变得狭小了许多，远方仿佛能看到坚实的土地。¤Are thinking when you find that the space around you seems to have become much narrower, as if you can see solid ground in the distance.
不会错的，就是这里！你多加小心，我也不能准确判断出这股气息的来源。¤There is no mistake, this is the place! You take more care, I can not accurately determine the source of this aura.
听了魏无极的话，你打起十二分精神小心翼翼地上了岸。不同于外面的乱石堆砌，此处装潢精致，似有人居。¤Listening to Wei Wuji's words, you put on twelve spirit and carefully went ashore. Unlike the rock pile outside, this place is exquisitely decorated and looks like a human residence.
你躲在石柱后悄悄地往屋子里望去，一只通体赤红的兽伏在毯上睡梦正酣。¤You hide behind a stone pillar and quietly look into the house, a red beast lying on a blanket sleeping soundly.
火麒麟！¤Fire Qilin!
难不成这里就是麟庙？¤Is this the Temple of the Forest Spirit?
这火麒麟修为过高，主意万万不能打到它身上。你不妨看看四周有无暗红色果实，倒是可以取走几颗。¤This fire unicorn cultivation is too high, the idea must not hit it. You may want to see if there are dark red fruits around, but you can take a few.
可是火麒麟尾边的那株矮木？¤But the fire unicorn tail side of the dwarf wood?
正是，此乃血菩提，为火麒麟伴生植物。¤Exactly, this is the Blood Bodhi Fruit, it is a plant that accompanies the birth of the Fire Qilin.
你飞速地捋下几颗果子揣进怀中拔腿冲回岩浆中，火麒麟并没有追上来。¤You quickly stroked down a few fruits into your arms and dashed back into the lava, the fire unicorn did not catch up with you.
你用神识护住自己，放轻动作摘下几颗果子，小心地返回原路。¤You use soul sense to protect yourself, lighten the action to pick a few fruits, carefully return to the original path.
你运起功法藏匿气息，静静地摘下几颗果子后原路返回。¤You run up the gong method to hide the breath, quietly pick a few fruits after the original way back.
此地连接离火门麟庙，你这{xiaozi}还是不要作死的好。¤This place is connected to the Lin Temple of the Heavenly Fire Gate, you {xiaozi} or do not make a good death.
我还不会敛息术。¤I do not yet converse breath technique.
小子快跑，你神识太低，敛息术不生效被发现了。¤Kid run, your soul sense is too low, convergence is not effective to be found.
你提气准备莽过去。¤You are ready to mangled past.
因为四象蟠龙带的功效你没有感到灼热，像是在海水中遨游一样，但围绕着你的却是绚烂的红色。¤Because of the efficacy of the four elephant coiled dragon belt you do not feel the burning, like swimming in seawater, but around you is a brilliant red.
因为避火珠的功效你没有感到灼热，像是在海水中遨游一样，但围绕着你的却是绚烂的红色。¤Because of the effect of the Fire cleansing pearl you did not feel the burning, like swimming in seawater, but around you is a brilliant red.
因为辟火袍的功效你没有感到灼热，像是在海水中遨游一样，但围绕着你的却是绚烂的红色。¤Because of the effectiveness of the fire robe you do not feel the burning, like swimming in seawater, but around you is a brilliant red.
不好，这离火门火山连接地脉，辟火袍不过一法器抵挡不住这离火门的岩浆！¤Not good, this Heavenly Fire Gate volcano is connected to the earth veins, fire robe but a magic weapon can not resist this fire door lava!
{vpunch=10,0.5}这是？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}This is?
咔.咔....咔¤Ka. Ka .... click
不好，这离火门火山连接地脉，辟火法袍抵挡不住这离火门的岩浆！¤Not good, this Heavenly Fire Gate volcano is connected to the earth veins, the fire-opening robe can not resist this fire door lava!
因为辟火法袍的功效你没有感到灼热，像是在海水中遨游一样，但围绕着你的却是绚烂的红色。¤Because of the efficacy of the fire-preventing robe you do not feel the burning, like swimming in seawater, but around you is a gorgeous red color.
因为辟火珠的功效你没有感到灼热，像是在海水中遨游一样，但围绕着你的却是绚烂的红色。¤Because of the effectiveness of the fire beads you do not feel the burning, like swimming in seawater, but around you is a brilliant red.
你身上虽没有辟火法宝，但你对火之道的领悟已经达到融会贯通，炙热的岩浆不能伤你分毫。¤Although you do not have the fire prevention magic treasure, but your understanding of the way of fire has reached the integration, the hot magma can not hurt you a bit.
小心！¤Watch out!
一团赤红的火焰直奔你而来。¤A crimson blaze comes straight at you.
{xiaozi}，你家炎鹤大人心情好，拿着走吧。¤{xiaozi}, your Lord Yanhe is in a good mood, take it and go.
你看到洞口激活一道光幕。¤You see a curtain of light activated at the entrance to the cave.
阁下能到此地也是缘分，这血菩提及送你了¤That your excellency can reach this place could only be fate, so I'll give you this blood bodhi seed.
你刚走到血菩提身后就被火麒麟发现，所见的最后一幕是横扫而来的牛尾。¤You had just walked behind the Blood Bodhit Fruit before being discovered by the Fire Qilin, the last scene you saw was a sweeping tail.
那我还是快点离开吧。¤Then I'd better leave quickly.
傻{xiaozi}，你这是被发现了，还好那火麒麟手下留情了。¤The silly {xiaozi}, you were discovered, fortunately the fire qilin showed mercy.
当你回过神来已经出现在火山口了，脚下还有一颗血菩提。¤When you come back to your senses you are already in the crater of the volcano, with a blood linden at your feet.
切，哪家的傻{xiaozi}？滚！¤Tch, which family are from stupid {xiaozi}? Get lost!
宁王殿下，属下已将人带到。¤His Royal Highness Ning, his subordinates have brought people there.
外界传闻宁王不过是筑基初期的修士，没想到气势竟如此恐怖！¤The outside world rumored that Ning King was just a cultivator in the early days of foundation building, but he didn't expect his momentum to be so terrifying!
{xiaozi}没见过世面，这可是凡世的真龙天子。不过依老夫观察，这宁王身上龙气涣散，且被浊气侵蚀，怕是为了延长寿命练了什么{color=#d0380a}奇怪的功法{/color}，才落得如此模样。¤{xiaozi} has never seen the world, this is the real dragon emperor of the mortal world. However, according to the old man's observation, the dragon spirit on Ning King's body has been slack, and the turbidity has been corroded, and I am afraid that he has practiced something to prolong his life. {color=#d0380a}Weird exercises{/color} are what it looks like.
你悄悄抬起头看向高坐堂上的宁王，此人形销骨立，面容枯槁，一身华服松松垮垮地挂在瘦削的躯体上，看起来格外滑稽。正在此时你恰巧对上他的目光，那一瞬间从他眼中露出的寒芒令你心生畏惧。¤You quietly raised your head to look at Ning King, who was sitting on the tall hall. The figure stood out, with a withered face, and a Chinese suit hanging loosely on his thin body, looking very funny. At this moment, you happened to meet his gaze. , The cold light that appeared in his eyes at that moment made you scared.
街路的两边人山人海，把斗法台围了个水泄不通，你不由地感到好奇，便也凑上前去...¤There are crowds of people on both sides of the street, and the Doufatai is surrounded by water. You can't help but feel curious, so you leaned forward...
诶，道友此言差矣，这世上能筑基之人是不少，但最后能结丹的可真是万里出一。¤Hey, fellow Daoist's words are not correct. There are many people in this world who can build foundations, but in the end, those who can build a pill really come out of ten thousand miles.
听说宁王府年年招揽供奉，但人数却依旧不多，想来这供奉也不是那么好当的。¤I heard that Prince Ning's Mansion recruits Guest Elder every year, but the number of people is still small. It is not so easy to come here for enshrinement.
又赢一个...此人已经连胜了三场，依我看他这次是很有希望啊。¤Won another... this guy has won three games in a row, so I think he is very hopeful this time.
此二人皆有筑基修为，你聚精会神地看了一会儿，只觉招招精妙，令你获益匪浅。¤Both of these two have the ability to build foundations. You watched attentively for a while, only to find that the tricks are wonderful, and you have benefited a lot.
哼，空有一身修为，却挖空心思想去为那宁王卖命，落入凡尘俗世被荣华富贵蒙蔽双眼，仙途也就到此止了吧。¤Hmph, Kong has a cultivation base, but he hollowed out his mind to sell his life for King Naning, fell into the mundane world and blinded his eyes by the glory and wealth, and the journey of immortality will end here.
斗法台上，两位头戴六合帽的修士打得不可开交，二人皆着墨绿小褂，上书遒劲古字，看来是师出同门。台下围观者众多，不时传来阵阵叫好声。¤On the stage of fighting, two cultivators wearing six-piece caps fought hard. They both wore dark green gowns and wrote ancient Chinese characters. They seemed to be from the same school. There were many onlookers in the audience, and from time to time there were bursts of cheers .
像我们这种天赋平平的，能筑基便已是走运，闭关修炼也不知何时是个头。人生苦短，倒不如享受享受荣华富贵。¤For those with mediocre talents like us, it is good luck to be able to build a foundation, and I don't know when to grow in retreat. Life is short, it is better to enjoy the glory and wealth.
师祖说过，四柄魔剑互有感应，被发现的时间也极为接近，所以那柄诛仙剑也极有可能在近日出世。¤Grandmaster said that the four demon swords are sensitive to each other, and the time of discovery is also very close, so the Zhuxian sword is very likely to be born in the near future.
因举办英杰会，且楼主驰援中州，诸多事宜之下，我白帝楼与倪家府邸附近总有陌生人出现，似有人图谋不轨，我白帝楼正在组织人手调查，为避免打草惊蛇，初来本地的小友很适合这个任务。¤Because of the hosting of the Heroes’ Meeting and the host’s assistance to Middle Province, due to many issues, strangers always appear near my White Emperor House and Ni’s mansion. It seems that someone is plotting wrongdoings. My White Emperor House is organizing a manual investigation to avoid ruckus. You as an outsider are very suitable for this task.
哈哈哈哈，凌轩小儿不在，白帝楼何人主事啊？¤Hahahaha, Ling Xuan's child is not here, who is in charge of White Emperor House?
最近这段时间，图南海一直有发狂的海兽袭击商队的传闻。¤Recently, there have been rumors of crazy sea beasts attacking caravans in Tunanhai.
小友这是？¤Little friend, this is?
那...你一定是发现了什么线索吧？¤Then...you must have found some clue?
你屏息凝神缩在角落，过了好一阵。¤You held your breath and shrank in the corner for a long while.
一般来说，能够引起如此天地异象的，一定是通天灵宝级别的法宝。所以大家都猜测，这漩涡便是某个海底遗迹的入口，而那通天灵宝，便藏在这个遗迹之中。¤Generally speaking, it must be a magic weapon of the Tongtian Lingbao level that can cause such a heaven and earth anomaly. So everyone guesses that this vortex is the entrance to a certain submarine relic, and that Tongtian Lingbao is hidden in this relic. in.
晚辈特来复命。¤Junior has returned after completing the assigned task.
恭送前辈。¤Senior respectfully.
师祖刚好在前些日子回到楼中，{FirstName}{xiongdi}不如直接去见他老人家吧。¤The Master just happened to return home a few days ago, {FirstName}{xiongdi} why don't you go pay respects to the old man?
他是种下¤He is planting...
血河，欺负年轻人有什么意思啊？老夫陪你玩玩！！！¤Blood River, what's the point of bullying young people? The old man will play with you!!!
正是！¤Exactly!
血河老儿，上次吃的教训还不够吗？¤Old Blood River, weren't the lessons learned last time enough?
也只能这...¤It can only be this...
总之，此番魔门夺走戮仙剑和绝仙剑，再加上之前天魔道手里的那柄陷仙剑，四剑已出其三。¤In short, this time the devil's gate took away the Immortal Executing Sword and the Absolute Immortal Sword, plus the one in the hands of the Heavenly Demon Dao before, the four swords have come out of its three.
没关系，师祖刚好在前些日子回到楼中，{FirstName}{xiongdi}不如直接去见他老人家吧。¤Don't worry about it, the Master just happened to return home the other day, {FirstName}{xiongdi} why don't you go and pay respects to the old man?
我有一要事想要当面求教白帝，不知他当下人在何处，可否与我见上一面？¤I have something important and want to ask The White Emperor face to face. I don't know where he is right now. Can you meet me?
加入了¤and he joined the
利用宁州本地修士的特点，来此刺探情报的。¤He took advantage of the influx of cultivators from Ning Province's Young Hero's Competition to mix in and gather information.
血剑宫妖人来袭，振东率白帝楼弟子以剑阵拖住这老鬼，城中魔修还望各位道友相助我白帝楼，事后必有重谢。¤Blood sword palace demon attacked, Zhendong led the Baidilou disciples to drag the old ghost with a sword formation. The evil cultivators repair in the city also hopes that fellow daoists will help me Baidilou. I will thank you afterwards.
倪振东，你算什么东西？这次你师父不在，等我破了阵，拿了剑，灭了你倪家满门！！¤Ni Zhendong, what are you? This time your master is not here, wait until I break the line, take the sword, and destroy your Ni family!!
多谢，前辈出手。¤Thank you, senpai.
更奇怪的是，这个漩涡不但位置飘忽不定，而且还时有时无，似乎只在特定的时间出现。¤What's even stranger is that not only is the location of this vortex erratic, but it also seems to appear only at a certain time.
这倒是个机会，虽然那遗迹里的一定不是诛仙剑，但却是一个弄清楚白帝真面目的好机会。¤This is an opportunity, although the sword in the ruins must not be Zhu Xianjian, but it is a good opportunity to figure out the true face of Emperor Bai.
此人名叫¤This person's name is
所以，小友你是否愿意成为我白帝楼的外围成员¤So, little friend, are you willing to be a peripheral member of my Baidilou?
我已经托白帝楼的师兄替我在广陵城备了船。{FirstName}{xiongdi}，事不宜迟，我们这便动身？¤I have asked the brother of Baidilou to prepare a boat for me in Guangling City. {FirstName}{xiongdi}, without further ado, shall we leave?
这...倪兄找我何事？¤This... why did Brother Ni look for me?
啊这...倒还没有。¤Ah...not yet.
李天嘛...我有些印象，我本以为他有所机缘方能突破。¤Li Tian... I have some impression of him, I thought he could break through if given a chance.
我白帝楼乃是剑修圣地，剑术典籍，仙剑，都是上乘之物，只要对我白帝楼有贡献便可自行换取。¤My white emperor building is the holy land of sword cultivation, sword art books, immortal swords, are the best things, as long as the contribution to my white emperor building can be exchanged for their own.
一切顺利。¤Everything went smoothly.
我白帝楼乃是百余年前，由九州第一剑修“白帝”在武陵城创立松散剑修组织，意在除魔卫道，还九州一个安宁。¤I, the White Emperor House is more than a hundred years ago, by the first sword cultivator in the Nine Provinces White Emperor in Wuling City founded loose sword cultivation organization, the intention is to eliminate the devil to defend the way, to return peace to the Nine Provinces.
害，魔门之间的关系错综复杂，我也弄不太清楚。¤Hurt, the relationship between the magic gates is intricate, and I can't figure it out.
哦？倪兄弟有何发现？¤Oh? What did Brother Ni discover?
太好了。¤Great.
再加上一直以来，图南海都有海底遗迹的传闻，说什么有古代的通天灵宝藏在里面。¤In addition, there have always been rumors that there have been seabed relics in Tunanhai, saying that there are ancient Tongtianling treasures hidden in it.
此番凶险，我还是不要出头为好。¤This time is dangerous, I'd better not talk about it.
虽然只是传闻，但绝对不是空穴来风。我将这两件事联系起来一想，觉得这海底遗迹中藏着通天灵宝，而且就是诛仙剑的可能性很大！¤Although it is only a rumor, it is definitely not groundless. I think about the connection between these two things, and think that there is a heavenly spirit treasure hidden in this submarine relic, and it is very likely that it is the Zhuxian sword!
好，那我这便前去。¤Okay, then I'll go ahead.
如此啊，那真是可惜了。¤So, that's a shame.
前辈不必如此，对亏您及时来援，四象封魔阵毫发无损。¤Senior needn't be like this, for your help in time for the loss, the Four Elephants Sealing Demon Array is unscathed.
一些普通的典籍和法宝自是没什么区别，但像天阶典籍这样的不传之秘，便只有内阁弟子才有资格换取了。¤Some ordinary tomes and magic treasures are no different, but untold secrets like the Heavenly Class tomes are only eligible for exchange by the inner pavilion disciples.
我这不是正准备去图南海调查么，这次来找你也是想邀请你一起去。要是有你相助，我们的把握就更大了！¤Isn't I about to go to Tunanhai to investigate? I also want to invite you to join me this time. If you help us, we will be more sure!
原来，怪不得其他人没有头绪¤It turns out to be like this.. No wonder we couldn't find any clues.
我也去了！¤I went too!
我已向师祖回禀此事，剩下的就是要弄清楚怎么才能进入遗迹了。¤I have reported this to my master, all that is left is to figure out how to enter the ruins.
此事我该从何入手？¤Where do I start in this matter?
这次多亏了小友，这人就交给我吧。¤Thank you my little friend, leave this person to me.
之前天魔道掌握着四柄魔剑之一的陷仙剑，因此势力最大，一直占据着最好的修炼资源。如今古神教和血剑宫各自也找回一柄魔剑，想必他们之间也少不了一番争斗。¤Previously, the Heavenly Demon Dao held the Immortal Sword, one of the four demon swords, so it was the most powerful and has always occupied the best training resources. Now the Ancient God Sect and the Blood Sword Palace have each retrieved a demon sword. A fight is inevitable.
本是一名平平无奇的散修，本次参加英杰会，修为大涨，出了不小风头。¤He is Li Tian, a mediocre independent cultivator, this year he participated in the Young Hero's Competition and had their cultivation level rise sharply, putting them in the limelight.
不算顺利...¤Not so smooth...
嗯，此事需尽快处理，以防日久生变。¤Well, this matter needs to be dealt with as soon as possible in case there are changes over time.
原来是{FirstName}{LastName}，你是初次来我白帝楼吧，之前比较仓促，此番就由我来为你详细介绍一下吧，你想要了解什么？¤It turned out to be {FirstName}{LastName}. This is your first visit to my Baidi Tower. You were in a rush before. Let me introduce you in detail this time. What do you want to know?
不过你放心，我师兄联合多位道友已在外埋伏，纵使留不下血河，也要付出代价，我们宁州岂是想来就来，想走就走的？¤But don't worry, my senior brother and many fellow daoists have been in ambush outside. Even if there is no blood, we will have to pay the price. How can we in Ning Province come and leave if we want?
那是自然，无尽之海不比我们宁州，可谓是高手如云。而且若真是诛仙剑出世，到时候不仅是魔门，说不定那四大妖圣也会来凑凑热闹。¤That's natural, the endless sea is no better than ours in Ning Province, it can be described as a master like a cloud. And if the sword of death is born, then not only the magic door, maybe the four demon saints will also come to join in the fun.
祭血使听令，动手！！！¤Sacrifice to the blood envoy to listen to the order, do it!!!
...是吗，和我记忆中不同啊¤...Is it different from what I remember
在宁州古迹出世的那柄戮仙剑，已经被玄骨老祖带回了衡州。古神教如今山门紧闭，因此没法打探到更多的消息。绝仙剑也在此前被血剑宫暗中夺取。¤The Immortal Executing Sword that came out in the Ning Province monument has been brought back to Heng Province by Patriarch Dark Bones. The Ancient God Sect is now closed, so it is impossible to find out more information. The Immortal Sword was also secretly seized by the Blood Sword Palace earlier.
{FirstName}前辈，{$TmpStrValue}道友正在炼丹室内等你。¤{FirstName}Senior {$TmpStrValue}Daoist is waiting for you inside the alchemy chamber.
说实话，这个漩涡很多人都见过，但海底遗迹和通天灵宝什么的就只是大家的猜测了。¤To be honest, many people have seen this vortex, but the relics of the sea and the Tongtian Lingbao are just everyone's guess.
这个传闻其实有些年头了，图南海上有一个巨大的漩涡，要是不巧被卷入这个旋涡，即便是元婴期修士也极难挣脱。¤This rumor is actually a few years old. There is a huge vortex in the Tunan Sea. If you accidentally get involved in this vortex, it will be extremely difficult for even a cultivator in the Nascent Soul period to break free.
好，那便麻烦你带路了。¤Alright, then I'll trouble you to lead the way.
你能听到城内杀声四起，直指白帝楼。¤You can hear the killings all over the city, pointing directly to the Baidi Tower.
楼外传来一声高呼。¤A shout came from outside the building.
等等...你是说白帝前辈也会去这个海底遗迹？¤Wait...You mean Senior Baidi will also go to this underwater ruin?
{FirstName}{xiongdi},此行可还顺利？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi},Did you have a good trip?
据说那些海兽很像宁州古迹中那些被煞气侵染的修士，神智不清，甚至会主动攻击比自己实力强大的人。¤It is said that those sea beasts are very similar to the cultivators infested by evil spirits in the ancient relics of Ning Province. They are unconscious and even actively attack people who are stronger than themselves.
事情原由，还请小友一一道来。¤The explanation of this matter, let's go through it bit by bit.
想要确保万无一失的话，还是得师祖这样的化神期强者出手才行。¤If you want to be sure of nothing, you still have to take the action of a powerful person such as the Deity Transformation.
好，我会在广陵城港口等你，到时候我们一起出发！¤Okay, I will wait for you at the port of Guangling City, and we will set off together at that time!
修为达到筑基期后，若你的剑道修为达到初窥门径且仍是散修之身，便可正式加入我白帝楼。¤After your cultivation reaches the foundation stage, if your sword Dao reaches the first glimpse of the door and you are still a independent cultivator, you can officially join my White Emperor House.
不如这样，前辈暂且回去等候，若是有消息了，我立刻通知前辈。¤Why don't, seniors go back and wait for now, if there is news, I will notify seniors immediately.
那真是太好了，眼下正有一件差事适合交给小友。¤That's really good, right now there is an errand suitable to give to little friend.
这图南海极为偏远，我们可以先搭船经由蓬莎岛，碎星岛后抵达南崖城。在那里修整后，我们再一路向西航行，穿过吞云海便能到达图南海了。¤This map of the South China Sea is extremely remote. We can take a boat through Pongsha Island and then the Broken Star Island and arrive at Nanya City. After repairing there, we will sail all the way to the west and pass through the Yunyun Sea to reach the Tunan Sea.
若你加入白帝楼，我们会发布一些调查或是剿灭魔修相关的任务。除此以外，若你平日里留意到什么有关魔门的线索，也可以来此汇报，我们会酌情给予你奖励。¤If you join the White Emperor House, we will issue some tasks related to the investigation or elimination of evil cultivators. In addition to this, if you notice any clues about the Devil Sect, you can also come here to report them, and we will give you rewards as appropriate.
你们这些废物，连个剑阵斗破不了，混元子老子没空和你玩。¤You rubbish, even a sword battle can't be broken, Hun Yuanzi Lao Tzu has no time to play with you.
听说过问道花么？这种奇花便是在图南海被发现的。相传此花蕴含一丝道之真意，是非常珍贵的炼丹草药，大部分人去那里都是冲着它去的。¤Have you heard of the Dao Seeker Flower? This strange flower was discovered in the South Atlas Sea. According to legends, this flower contains a trace of the true meaning of Dao. It is a very precious herb. It is sought by many.
你已加入我白帝楼，之后事宜可以来我白帝楼找当值执事。¤You have joined my White Emperor Pavillion, you can come at any time to find the deacon on-duty for new tasks or services.
武陵城客栈掌柜是我白帝楼的人，此事你可以先去问问他有什么详细的情报。¤Wuling City innkeeper is my white emperor building people, this matter you can first go to ask him what detailed information.
金丹期内阁弟子入阵迎敌！！¤Golden Core Court disciples entered the battle to meet the enemy!!
原来是{FirstName}{LastName}前辈，不知前辈今日来白帝楼是有何事？¤It turned out to be senior {FirstName}{LastName}, I wonder what happened to senior who came to Baidi Tower today?
那这个海底遗迹的位置确定了么？¤Then the location of this undersea ruin is determined?
按师祖的吩咐，我们最近一直在调查相关的传闻，你猜怎么着？¤According to the Grandmaster's instructions, we have been investigating related rumors recently. Guess what?
因举办英杰会等诸多事宜之下，武陵城涌入大量的散修。近日我白帝楼与倪家府邸附近总有陌生人出现，似有人图谋不轨，我白帝楼正在组织人手调查，为避免打草惊蛇，初来本地的小友很适合这个任务。¤Due to many matters such as the Young Hero's Competition, Wuling City has seen a large influx of independent cultivators. Recently, there are always strangers near the residence of the White Emperor Pavillion and the Ni family, something seems off about this.
请讲。\n¤Please speak.\n
老道我一时不察让贵派遭受此劫，愧对白帝阁下临行对我的托付啊。¤The old way I didn't notice for a while and let the nobility suffer this calamity, I am ashamed of the entrustment of the Lord Baidi to me.
从宁州古迹回来后，我与几位白帝楼的师兄一起奉命调查戮仙剑和剩下几柄魔剑的下落，如今终于有了一些头绪。¤After returning from the ancient sites in Ning Province, I was ordered to investigate the whereabouts of the Immortal Executing Sword and the remaining Devil Swords together with several seniors from Baidilou. Now I finally have some clues.
我正想找你，刚准备给你发传音符就发现你来了武陵城，实在是太巧了！¤I was looking for you. I found out that you came to Wuling City just as I was about to send you a sound transmission. It's a coincidence!
这...白帝前辈行踪不定，而且极少回白帝楼，我也许久没有见到他了。¤This... Senior Baidi's whereabouts are uncertain, and he rarely returns to the Baidi Tower. I may not have seen him for a long time.
按你之前的说法，莫非你找到了诛仙剑的线索？¤According to your previous statement, did you find the clue to Zhu Xianjian?
要在此地采集矿石吗？¤Want to collect ore here?
要离开连石山吗？¤Do you want to leave Liangshi Mountain?
说来话长，在下师妹诡毒侵体，实虚宁州香薷入药。万般无奈之下叨扰姑娘修行，望姑娘千万海涵。¤The actual virtual Ning Province Elsholtzholtzholtzholtz is a medicine.
要在这里采集火铜吗？{w}{w=0.5}¤Do you want to collect fire copper here? {w}{w=0.5}
那些深邃的剑痕中多了一道崭新的痕迹，其中蕴凝着属于你的体悟。¤There is a brand new trace in those deep sword marks, which contains the comprehension that belongs to you.
你听从魏无极的指点将背后的铁剑握在手中，跟随剑意指引挥出剑招。¤You heed Wei Wuji's instruction to hold the iron sword behind you in your hand and follow the sword's intent to guide you in wielding its stance.
剑随心动，{xiaozi}！¤The sword moves with the heart, {xiaozi}!
你面朝剑壁席地而坐，蜂拥而至的剑意挤压着你的神识，你在其中似乎触摸到一丝奇妙的法门。¤You sit on the ground facing the sword wall, the swarming sword intent squeezing your divine consciousness, in which you seem to touch a hint of a wonderful dharma.
还差一点......¤Not even close ......
有着前两次参悟的经验，你轻车熟路地进入了状态，但不知为何灵光转瞬即逝，你没能抓住它。¤With the experience of your first two enlightenments, you enter the state with ease, but somehow the aura is fleeting and you fail to catch it.
你盯着剑壁上纵横的剑痕，很快便进入了参悟状态。¤You stared at the sword marks crisscrossing the sword wall and soon entered the state of enlightenment.
当时我在此处顿悟，自创功法《神剑诀》。¤At that time, I had an epiphany here and created my own technique, Divine Sword Technique.
你这{xiaozi}悟性不错，既能体悟石壁剑意那便多来此处几次，或许也能有我这样的际遇。¤You {xiaozi} have good comprehension, both can comprehend the stone wall sword intention then come here a few more times, perhaps also can have my such encounter.
如果我的猜测无误，或许是上古两位剑修大能在此处斗法比试，无意中造就了这充满剑意的山壁。¤If my guess is correct, perhaps two ancient sword cultivation masters fought and competed here, inadvertently creating this mountain wall full of sword intent.
上古两位剑修大能在此处斗法比试，无意中造就了这充满剑意的山壁。¤In the past, two great sword cultivators fought and competed here and inadvertently created this mountain wall full of sword intent.
你缓缓地睁开双眼，发现一位身着金虹剑派长老服的修士若有所思地立于山壁旁。¤You slowly open your eyes and find a cultivator dressed in the Radiant Sword Sect elder clothes standing thoughtfully by the mountain wall.
察觉到你的变化，他转过身向你走来，你也因此看清了他的眉目，此人竟是门派中的明河剑仙。¤Noticing your change, he turns around and approaches, and you thus see his visage clearly, this person is actually your sect's Elder Radiant River.
我也不知道怎么回事，这山壁好像有蹊跷...上面的痕迹虽杂乱却剑意十足，不似自然造化。¤I do not know how, this mountain wall seems to have something strange ... The traces on it are messy but full of sword intent, not like natural creation.
没错，这剑壁确实不简单。¤Yes, this sword wall is indeed not simple.
你这{xiaozi}总算醒了，还好这两天金虹剑派的巡逻弟子未到此地，不然有你好果子吃。¤You {xiaozi} finally woke up, you're fortunate the Radiant Sword Sect disciples who were on patrol did not arrive here these past two days, otherwise you'd be forced to eat crow.
玄妙的剑痕道法纷呈，令你神游太虚。¤The mysterious sword marks of the dao are strewn, causing you to travel too far into the void.
你好奇地靠近了些，发现山壁上满是纵横的沟壑，一道道或锋锐或柔和的剑气萦蕴其中。¤You are curious to get closer and find that the mountain wall is full of longitudinal ravines, a sharp or soft Sword Qi lingers in it.
此处山壁绵连，走势陡峭，奇怪的是耸起的山峰有些险峻，有些平缓，似是被锐物拦腰切断，呈出圆钝的顶峰。¤The mountain walls here are continuous and steep, and the strange thing is that some of the peaks that rise are precipitous and some are gentle, as if they were cut off by sharp objects, showing a rounded and blunt peak.
领悟法术：《斩天剑》¤Comprehending spells: Chopping Heaven Sword
上次对剑壁的领悟还未完全消化，还是过段时间再来吧。¤The comprehension of the sword wall last time has not been fully digested, so it is better to come back after a while.
你对剑道产生了一些新的感悟...¤You have gained some new insights into the Sword Dao...
你对剑道的领悟略微提升了。¤Your comprehension of the sword dao has slightly improved.
只要你帮我办事，此间事了，我便收你为徒打点入教之事。若是修炼有成，区区寿元亏空又算得了什么？¤As long as you help me to work, this matter is over, I will accept you as a disciple to play the matter of joining the religion. If you are successful in cultivation, what is a mere loss of life expectancy?
哦？是同门师弟？离火门可没有叫人听墙角的功法，师弟若执意修炼也只好留下性命了！¤Oh? Is it a fellow disciple? The Heavenly Fire Gate doesn't have a technique that allows people to listen around corners. If you insist on practicing, you have to leave your life behind!
或许天道注定我与青嫣不应该在一起......¤Perhaps the heavens have destined me and Qingyan should not be together ......
你有些不耐烦地同他解释问题并不出在炼丹上，但他显然没有听进去。¤You are a little impatient to explain to him that the problem is not in the alchemy, but he obviously did not listen.
你说的也对，但我真的放不下......¤You are right, but I really can't let go ......
你耐着性子又和他缕清原委，希望他重视修炼。¤You patiently again and he clarified the reason, hope he pay attention to cultivation.
唉，道理我都懂。她怎么就这么不通人情呢......¤I understand all the reasons. Why is she so insensitive ......
你才说了没几句，徐凡就语气哀怨地打断了你。¤You have only said a few words, Xu Fan interrupted you in a sorrowful tone.
修炼没有进步就推脱说自己痴迷炼丹，痴迷炼丹却又没有成果，也难怪她毫无留恋！¤The cultivation is not progressing, then excused that they are obsessed with alchemy, obsessed with alchemy but no results, no wonder she has no love!
你这人也忒不讲道理，我俩如何干卿底事？¤You people are also too unreasonable, how do we two do the bottom of the matter?
说着徐凡竟祭出灵剑，看架势是想与你一比高下。¤Xu Fan said Xu Fan even sacrificed the spirit sword, look at the attitude is to want to compete with you.
道理讲不通便刀剑相向，徐道友实实窝囊废一个！¤If you can't reason with me, you'll fight with your sword.
我看青嫣说得没错，不思进取、懦弱无能就是用来形容你这种人的。¤I think Qingyan is right, do not think about progress, cowardly and incompetent is used to describe people like you.
这叫什么事儿啊......¤What is this matter ah ......
你叹了口气认命地走出去，看到徐凡失魂落魄的样子，你决定¤You sigh in resignation and walk out, seeing Xu Fan's lost soul, you decide
道友不必躲躲藏藏了，我已经看见你了。¤Daoist friend no need to hide, I have seen you.
你看向身后，原来刚才只顾着不被青嫣发现极力向后挪动，导致你的衣角露出了石柱的另一边。¤You look behind you, it turns out that just now only concerned about not being found by Qingyan extremely moved backwards, resulting in the corner of your clothes exposed the other side of the stone pillar.
说完女子头也不回地向洞口走去，你连忙朝石柱内侧蹭了蹭以免被发现。¤After saying that the woman did not look back towards the cave entrance, you hurriedly rubbed towards the inside of the stone pillar to avoid being found.
没想到蹲守此处竟看了场话本似的闹剧，你不禁感到有些无奈。¤I did not expect to squat here to watch a play like a farce, you can not help but feel a little helpless.
看不起炼丹？我是看不起你！¤Look down on alchemy? I am looking down on you!
炼丹几十年，就算服用你自己炼制的丹药也该突破筑基了，偏偏你的修为一点长进都没有。¤Alchemy decades, even if you take your own pills should also break through the foundation, but your cultivation has not grown at all.
你又何必如此看不起炼丹？¤Why do you have to look down on alchemy so much?
女子怒极反笑，看向徐凡的目光中已然带着凛冽冷意。¤The woman laughed in anger and looked at Xu Fan with a bitter coldness in her gaze.
先前共同规划的仙途如今半点也没实现，我看你我的缘分到此为止了。¤The immortal path that we planned together has not been realized, so I think our destiny ends here.
青嫣，你的道是什么？¤Qing Yan, what is your path?
修仙之人大道千万，各有不同。但我既入了星河剑派，剑自然就是我的道。¤There are many different paths for immortal cultivators. But since I joined the Star River Sword School, the sword is naturally my path.
但剑却不是我的道。¤But the sword is not my dao.
笑话！剑不是你的道，你却入金虹剑派！难不成金虹剑派专教人炼丹不成？¤What a joke! The sword is not your dao, yet you joined the Radiant Sword Sect! Has the Radiant Sword Sect now begun teaching people how to refine pills as their specialty?
徐凡，你若再这样不思进取我看先前的约定不如就作罢吧。¤Xu Fan, if you continue to be unprogressive like this, I think the previous agreement should be dropped.
为了不被发现，你悄悄地矮下身子藏在了石柱后面，谨慎地探出头打量着洞内的情况。¤In order not to be discovered, you quietly ducked down and hid behind a stone pillar, cautiously poking your head out to survey the situation inside the cave.
刚进入石洞，你便听到女子的声音传来。¤Just as you enter the stone cave, you hear a woman's voice coming from it.
你近日修炼成果如何了？\r¤How are the results of your recent cultivation? \r
只见一位金虹剑派的男修同星河剑派的女修立于洞中，不知在商议着什么。¤You only see a male cultivator of the Golden Rainbow Sword School standing in the cave with a female cultivator of the Star River Sword School, not knowing what they are discussing.
咦？是徐凡师兄。难不成另一位星河剑派的女修就是他口中的朋友？¤Huh? It's Brother Xu Fan. Can't it be that the other female cultivator of the Xinghe Sword School is the friend he was talking about?
哼，你听到什么那就是什么！好好沟通你不听，不如打得你听！¤Hmph, what you hear that's what! If you don't listen to a good communication, you might as well fight to make you listen!
道友此话何意？¤What do you mean by that, fellow Daoist?
提及青嫣，徐凡面色一变，显然是被戳到了痛处。¤Mentioning Qing Yan, Xu Fan's face changed, obviously was poked to the sore spot.
道理我都......¤Reason I all ......
道理你都懂，只怪壮志难酬，青梅竹马数十载不抵世俗成见？¤Moral you all understand, only blame the ambition is difficult to reward, childhood friends for dozens of years does not resist the world's stereotypes?
咦......？道友真是我徐凡的知音，竟不用说完便能猜到我心中所想。¤Huh ......? You are really my Xu Fan's soulmate, not even have to say it will be able to guess what I have in mind.
听闻此言你不禁怒从中来，亮出了自己的法器。¤Hearing this you can not help but anger from it, light up their magic weapon.
简直是对牛弹琴！像你这样懦弱无能又不思进取的窝囊废活该青嫣看不上你！¤It's like playing the piano to a cow! A cowardly, incompetent and unmotivated loser like you deserves to have Qingyan not see you!
你到底能不能讲通道理？¤Can you be reasonable or not?
还有正事要办，先不要到处乱逛了吧。¤There's still business to be done. Let's not wander around first.
倪旭欣的房门紧闭着，你决定...？¤The door to Ni XuXin's room was closed tightly. You decided...?
你想也不想，直接把手放在门上想要将门推开。未曾想一股强大的禁制之力传来，猝不及防间你被向后推去，结结实实地摔了个屁股墩儿。¤You do not even think about it, directly put your hand on the door trying to push it open. You were caught off guard by a powerful forbidden force, and you were pushed backwards and fell on your butt.
你轻轻地叩了叩门，一股柔和的禁制之力将你的手推了回去。¤You knocked gently on the door, and a soft forbidden force pushed your hand back.
你弄出的声音引起了倪旭欣的注意，他来到房门口大声地呼喊着。¤The sound you made caught Ni XuXin's attention, and he came to the door of the room and shouted loudly.
{FirstName}{LastName}{xiongdi}！你总算来了！¤{FirstName}{LastName}{xiongdi}! You're finally here!
你在院子里转了几圈，大大小小的装饰摸了个遍，也没想出什么破解的办法。¤You went around the courtyard a few times, touched all the decorations, large and small, and did not come up with any crack.
老头儿，你有什么办法解开倪家主的禁制吗?¤Old man, do you have any way to unlock the Ni family head's restriction?
办法是有，可你和这小子修为太低。¤There is a way, but both of you have too low of a cultivation base.
......你还不如直接说没办法。¤...... You might as well just say there's no way.
倪兄！这禁制有些棘手，想来只凭你我之力无法破开，只好委屈你在房间里多待一阵了。¤Brother Ni! This restriction is a bit tricky, we can't break it with just you and me, so I'll have to ask you to stay in the room for a while longer.
呜呼哀哉！！！¤Woe is me!!!
你似乎隔着房门听见了心碎的声音...¤You seem to hear the sound of a broken heart through the door of the room...
你轻轻地叩了叩门，一股柔和的禁制之力将你的手推了回去...¤You knocked gently on the door, a soft forbidden force pushed your hand back...
二叔！杨管家！倪长老！我再也不乱跑了！你们快把禁制解了吧！¤Second Uncle! Housekeeper Yang! Elder Ni! I won't wander off anymore! You guys get the restraint out of the way!
你清了清嗓子，房间里立刻没了声音。¤You clear your throat and the room is immediately silent.
门外可是{FirstName}{LastName}{xiongdi}？¤Outside the door but {FirstName}{LastName}{xiongdi}?
咳，我来探望一下倪兄。¤Ahem, I've come to visit Brother Ni.
话说先前那张传送符将你送去了何处？¤That said, where did that previous teleportation talisman send you to?
不知为何，倪旭欣的声音听起来有一些颤抖，你只当他是关心你的情况，便安慰道¤I don't know why, but Ni XuXin's voice sounded a little shaky, and you just assumed he was concerned about your situation, so you said comfortingly
也算幸运，没有将我传送到什么奇怪的地方，我一睁眼睛便发现自己身处天星城问道楼前了。¤It was lucky that I wasn't transported to some strange place, and as soon as I opened my eyes I found myself in front of the Heavenly Star City Inquirer Building.
也！算！幸！运！¤Also! It's lucky! Lucky! Luck!
你知道为什么我又被关禁闭了吗！这个符它！直接！把我传送回了倪！家！大！院！¤Do you know why I was confined again! This charm it! Directly! Transported me back to Ni! Home! Home! courtyard!
倪旭欣自顾自地在房间里发泄着不满，为了自己的耳朵着想，你决定过一阵再来看他。¤Ni XuXin vents his displeasure in his room to himself, and for the sake of your own ears, you decide to visit him again after a while.
你轻轻敲了敲门，一股柔和的禁制之力将你的手推开。¤You knock gently on the door, and a soft forbidding force pushes your hand away.
唉，好不容易逃出去却又被传送了回来......难道我的青春就要在禁闭里度过了吗？¤Alas, it was so hard to escape but was transported back ...... Is my youth going to be spent in confinement?
我爹在屋子里下了禁制，说我要是不能突破到筑基期，就不让我再出门了！¤My father put a restriction on the house, saying that if I can't break through to Foundation Establishment, I won't be allowed to go out again!
你有没有什么办法把我弄出去？？¤Do you have any way to get me out?
你答应了倪旭欣的请求，但倪府内高手林立，你二人秉烛夜谈，制定了粗略的计划。¤You agreed to Ni XuXin's request, but there are many experts in the Ni House, and the two of you talked by candlelight at night and made a rough plan.
你认为倪旭欣多虑了，拒绝了他的请求。¤You thought Ni XuXin was overly concerned and refused his request.
不知{FirstName}{xiongdi}可有时间在府中逗留几日，帮我探寻一下他们的情况？¤I wonder {FirstName}{xiongdi} if you have time to stay in the house for a few days and help me explore their situation?
若觉得我到处惹是生非招人嫌何必等到今日才表露出来？¤If you think I'm going around causing trouble and attracting suspicion why did you wait until today to show it?
一定是他们做了什么对不起我的亏心事。¤They must have done something wrong to my heart.
不成，我想想还是觉得有些古怪。¤No, I still feel a little odd when I think about it.
但我绞尽脑汁也想不出为何二叔也要躲着我，难不成这几人偷偷做了什么对不起我的事？¤But I racked my brains can not think of why the second uncle also want to avoid me, it is difficult not these people secretly did something wrong to me?
“一剑削了胡子...这谁看了都得绕着你走吧......”¤A sword cut the beard ... This who look at it have to go around you, right ......
长老还算有迹可循，毕竟我没少给他添麻烦，刚回府那日练剑时还不小心一剑削了他的胡子。¤The elders are still traceable, after all, I did not give him less trouble, just returned to the house that day when practicing sword also accidentally a sword cut his beard.
倪旭荣这小子也算了，平日就不怎么亲近我。¤Ni Xurong this kid also forget, usually not very close to me.
不知道为什么，府里的人见我像见了什么洪水猛兽一般。消息没打听到几个，气倒受了不少。¤I don't know why, the people in the house see me like a flood of what beast general. The news did not hear a few, but suffered a lot of anger.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你总算来了，这几日我在府内真是不自在极了。¤I'm really uncomfortable in the house these days.
你将准备去的地点告知倪旭欣，由他出马缠住房间主人，你乘机溜入房内展开调查。¤You will inform Ni XuXin where you are going, and he will go around the owner of the room. You take the opportunity to sneak into the room and investigate.
昨日你答应倪旭欣探寻众人隐瞒他之事，先去哪里好呢？¤Yesterday you promised Ni XuXin to look for people to conceal him. Where should I go first?
多谢{FirstName}{xiongdi}带来消息，我倪府必将找出登上那海上仙山的办法。¤I'd like to thank {FirstName}{xiongdi} for bringing the news, I'm sure the Ni House will find a way to get to that sea fairy mountain.
此山几次现世都被记录在册，天机阁也曾派出修士前往东海查探仙山踪迹。但东海迷雾朦朦，连金丹修士都会在其中迷失方向，倪家奉命前去东海搜寻的供奉就因这海雾失去了联系。¤This mountain has been recorded several times, and the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion has also sent cultivators to the East Sea to investigate the trail of the immortal mountain. But the East Sea is so misty that even Jindan cultivators can lose their way in it. The Ni family's Guest Elder who was ordered to go to the East Sea to search for it lost contact with it because of the sea fog.
这可真是棘手......¤This is really tricky ......
倪兄有何见解？¤What is your opinion, Brother Ni?
实不相瞒，我们在得到这个消息之时便前去天机阁打听岱舆山的方位。¤I'm not going to lie, when we got this news we went to the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion to inquire about the direction of the Daiji Mountain.
望日后若{FirstName}{xiongdi}获得岱舆踪迹还可知会我一声。¤I hope that later if {FirstName}{xiongdi} get Daijiu traces can also let me know.
你将从灵药堂打听来的消息说与倪旭欣，他神色微动，似是要说什么又忍住了。¤You told Ni XuXin what you heard from Spirit Herb Hall, he looked slightly surprised, seeminly wanting to say something but hold it back.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}何事？¤The first name is {FirstName}{xiongdi}what is it?
我方才问过长老，待我爹完全康复大约也需要一段时日，{FirstName}{xiongdi}若是想打听御剑门之事不如一个月后再来。¤I asked the elders, my father will need a period of time to fully recover, {FirstName}{xiongdi}If you want to inquire about the Imperial Sword Sect, why not come back in a month?
这份谢礼是以倪家的名义送给{xiongdi}的，你就收下吧。¤This is a thank you gift to {xiongdi} in the name of the Ni family, so you can take it.
既然如此我就却之不恭了，不知倪家主醒来大概需要多久？¤I'm not sure how long it will take for the Ni family head to wake up.
我知道{xiongdi}帮助我是出于情义，但此次你帮助的不仅仅是我，还有我身后的整个倪家。¤I know that {xiongdi} helped me out of love, but this time you helped not only me, but also the entire Ni family behind me.
是我唐突了，大恩不言谢。{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我先把这药拿给长老好快些嘱咐供奉炼药，麻烦你在此稍等片刻。¤It was me who was abrupt, a great kindness without words of thanks. The first thing I'd like to do is to give this medicine to the elders so that they can quickly instruct Guest Elders to refine it.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}！我已将此事告给长老，大约再有十日八日丹药便能炼制出来！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}! I have told the elders about this, about ten more days and eight days the pill will be refined!
过了半晌他才反应过来，急切的目光紧盯着玉盒。¤Only after a long time did he react, his eager eyes fixed on the jade box.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，这灵药你开个价吧，不论多少我们倪家都要了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, this Pill you make a price, no matter how much we Ni family will take.
你将先前发生的事一五一十地说给倪旭欣，然后把从阮五娘那里得到的天蝉灵叶转交给倪旭欣。¤You tell Ni XuXin exactly what happened earlier, and then hand the Skyscada Leaf you received from Ruan Wuniang to Ni XuXin.
倪旭欣一副呆若木鸡的样子，似乎是被突如其来的喜讯冲昏了头。¤Ni XuXin looked as if he was dumbfounded, seemingly overwhelmed by the sudden happy news.
你我相交甚久，倪兄竟认为我是乘人之危的小人吗？¤You and I have known each other for a long time, how dare brother Ni think I am a villain who takes advantage of people's danger?
这些是倪府的薄礼，请你务必收下。¤This is a small gift from the House of Ni, please be sure to accept it.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，何事？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, what is it?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你总算来了！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, you're finally here!
总之...也不知道为什么，府里的人见我像见了什么洪水猛兽一般，什么都不肯和我说。¤Anyway... I don't know why, but the people in the house see me like some kind of flooded beast and refuse to talk to me about anything.
长老还算有迹可循，毕竟我刚回府那日练剑时不小心一剑削了他的胡子。¤The elders are still traceable, after all, I just returned to the house that day when practicing sword accidentally a sword cut his beard.
我可是已经突破到金丹期了，怎么会还会到处闯祸！{xiongdi}可别把我还当成那个成天离家出走的孩子了。¤I've already broken through to the Golden Core stage, so how can I still get into trouble everywhere! {xiongdi} Don't think of me as the kid who still runs away from home all day long.
我也是这么认为的，可若是家里出了什么大事，怎么可能没人告诉我呢？¤I thought so too, but if there was something big going on at home, how could no one tell me?
唉，自打我回府以来的这段时间真是不自在极了。¤Alas, the time since I returned to the house has been uncomfortable.
诸位宾客也是各自聊着不知是什么的话题。¤The guests are also each chatting about something they do not know what it is.
通羽，时间差不多了，准备进行仪式吧。¤Tong Yu, it's about time, let's get ready for the ceremony.
那，择日不如撞日，我们现下就出发，如何？¤Well, it's better to hit the sun instead of choosing a day. Let's set off now, how about it?
行对席礼！自礼成起，你二人当是琴瑟和同，不分贵贱。¤Let's have a pair of rituals! From the moment the ceremony is completed, you two should be in harmony, regardless of your rank.
还是说，就是丹阳子命你们为难我，借此羞辱我师父？¤Or is it that Danyangzi ordered you to make things difficult for me and use it to humiliate my master?
三个金丹期修士，连一个筑基初期的丫头片子都看不住。¤Three Jindan stage Vagrant Cultivators can't even watch a girl at the early stage of foundation building.
曾经倪兄拉我去探险时，也是这么说的。¤Brother Nee once said the same thing when he took me to explore.
抱歉，我还有其他事要忙，{$Lin}还是另找他人吧。¤Sorry, I have other things to do, {$Lin} will find someone else.
行沃盥礼！自礼成起，你二人当是着眼未来，不论过去。¤Performing the rituals of the Vow! Since the ceremony is completed, you two should be looking at the future, regardless of the past.
倪家主闻言只是哈哈大笑，然后便是转过头去与其他人闲聊，不再与脸色不悦的星宫大长老言语什么，后者也只能转向通羽上人，试图转移被奚落的尴尬。¤The Ni family master only laughed at his words, and then he turned his head to chat with others, no longer saying anything to the unhappy-looking Grand Elder of the Star Palace, who could only turn to Lord Tong Yu, trying to deflect the embarrassment of being taunted.
是矣，倪家主可是对双修抱有兴趣？可惜我星宫秘术从不外传，不然倒是可以与倪家主探讨探讨。¤The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on a new one. It's a pity that the secret techniques of my Star Palace are never passed on, otherwise I could discuss them with the Ni family owner.
沃盥礼成！¤The rite of passage is complete!
我已命人封锁天星城，且派人于城内搜索。心儿离去的时间还不长，料想也还未出城。¤I have ordered people to blockade the Star City, and sent people to search the city. The time for Xin'er to leave is not yet long, so I think she has not yet left the city.
冲虚散人只是象征性地动作几下便已了事。而林沐雪却是仔仔细细地将纤纤玉手清洁干净，方才缓慢地抽回。让冲虚等得是极不耐烦，但当着宾客又不便发作。¤The person who is in charge of the vapour is only symbolically moving a few times and then it's done. But Lin Mu Xue is carefully cleaned the delicate hand, and only then slowly draw back. The person who is waiting is impatient, but in front of the guests and inconvenient.
冲虚道友息怒，此次联姻，我们林家广邀同道，出了岔子自然也是颜面大损，怎会以此羞辱道友呢？¤The Lin family has invited many people to join us in this marriage, so it is natural to lose face if something goes wrong.
宾客随通羽上人的话语望向大殿入口。¤The guests followed the words of Lord Tong Yu looked towards the entrance of the great hall.
待你走到林家大殿门口时，却听到原本只是各位前辈平淡闲聊的大殿之中传出嘈杂的争吵声。¤When you walk to the door of the Lin family hall, but heard the original just the seniors bland gossip in the middle of the hall came out noisy quarrels.
（这...看来倪兄猜对了，星宫和林家的联姻果然有些猫腻，只是不知究竟发生了什么。）¤（This... It seems that Brother Ni was right, the marriage between the Star Palace and the Lin family is really something fishy, I just don't know what exactly happened.）
哼，说的好听，但若是未抓到那丫头又当如何？¤Humph, nice talk, but if the girl is not caught and how?
其右是林沐雪，她戴万载冰心石所铸繁复银色冠，以砗磲所产明珠为饰。又用灵气化扇，施然掩面。远而观之，如雾似幻，难窥真容；迫而察之，花容似玉，身段如娟。往下则着缟衣素袡，以红丝绣百鸟朝凤纹，上覆丝幜，尽显端庄。¤The right is Lin Mu Xue, she wears ten thousand years of ice heart stone cast complex silver crown, with giant clams produced beads as decoration. She also used her aura to turn into a fan and covered her face. From a distance, she looked like a foggy illusion, and it was hard to see her real face; when she was examined, her face looked like jade, and her body was like Juan. The person is wearing an onyx coat with red silk embroidered with a hundred birds and phoenixes, covered with silk antique, showing dignity.
好吧，其实是我发现了一个元婴妖兽的洞窟，当时有事在身没能摸清对方的底细，现在有了些空闲于是想找你一同探访一番。¤Well, actually, I discovered a cave of the Nascent Soul monster. At that time, I was in trouble and couldn't find out the details of the other party. Now that I have some free time, I want to visit you together.
{$Lin}你都元婴期了，怎么还是小孩子脾气。¤{$Lin}You are in the Yuan Ying stage, why are you still a child?
哼，就你喜欢嘚瑟，早晚不理你了。¤Hmph, just because you like to scoff, sooner or later I will ignore you.
咳，星宫虽是精于双修一道，但从来都是提倡结侣自由，不为修为所缚，冲虚作为我的弟子，自然也是遵循此道。¤Ahem, although the Star Palace is skilled in the dual cultivation path, it has always advocated the freedom of coupling and not being bound by cultivation, and as my disciple, Chong Xu naturally follows this path.
啊？¤what?
通羽上人尚未说完，冲虚散人抢先凝灵气为刀，将瓠从中分一为二，倒苦酒于内。¤Before Tongyu finished speaking, Chongxu Sanren condensed his aura into a blade!
探讨就不用了，我只是好奇你徒儿为何找上林家的筑基后辈而已。¤I'm just curious about why your apprentice is looking for the Lin family's foundation building descendants.
对席礼成！¤To Xi Lixing!
无惑大长老，我曾听说星宫秘术以伉俪二人修为相近为佳，可是如此？¤I've heard that the secret art of the Star Palace is best when the couple is close in cultivation, but is that so?
殿内众人本是将注意力集中在结侣仪式上，满座大能竟无人留意你走入殿中。直到你出言阻止，这才齐刷刷的将注意力转移过来。¤The people in the hall were focused on the coupling ceremony, and no one in the room paid attention to you walking into the hall. It was only when you spoke out to stop it that all eyes turned to it.
嘿嘿，果然没白想着你好。¤Hey, I really didn't think about you in vain.
好吧...¤Ok...
原本落座于此的公孙家、百里家和倪家家主都已是不知去向，殿中只剩林家和星宫的诸位长老，除此之外再无他人。¤Originally seated here, the Gongsun family, the Baili family and the Ni family head are already unknown, the hall is left with the Lin family and the elders of the Star Palace, in addition to no one else.
奉盆侍从立即退下，又有其他侍从取龙凤纹漆案竖置殿中，置双色灵鹿肉于其上，使新人隔漆案相对而站。¤The pot attendant immediately retired, and other attendants to take the dragon and phoenix pattern lacquer case erected in the hall, set the two-color deer meat on it, so that the newcomers stand opposite each other across the lacquer case.
{size=20}我在外人面前才不会这样。{/size}¤{size=20}I wouldn't do this in front of outsiders. {/size}
取礼器！¤Take the ritual weapon!
诸位，吉时已至，星宫长老冲虚散人与林府大小姐结侣典礼正式开始！请新人上殿！¤Gentlemen, the auspicious time has arrived, the coupling ceremony between the Star Palace elder Chong Xu Sanren and the first lady of the Lin Mansion officially begins! Please invite the new couple to the hall!
两位新人背对而立，面向铜盆，以手入水，澡之。¤The two newcomers stand with their backs to each other, facing the copper basin, with hands into the water, bathing.
说好听点你们是林家的长老，说不好听点你们就是空活百岁的老废物！¤To put it nicely you are the elders of the Lin family, to put it badly you are empty living 100 years old waste!
再有侍从上前取走余下鹿肉及盛器，且奉瓠与苦酒置于案上。¤Then an attendant came forward to take away the remaining venison and serving ware, and served gourd and bitter wine on the case.
哼，闯我大典还满口胡言，饶你不得！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Humph, intruding on my grand ceremony and still full of nonsense, you cannot be spared! {vpunch=10,0.5}
（我还是先行离开吧，免得被卷入其中。）¤（I'd better leave first, lest I get caught up in it.）
眼下只待冲虚散人和林沐雪各饮一半器中苦酒，再换器饮尽，通羽便是要宣布合卺礼成，两位新人也将在宁州诸位正道巨擘的见证下成为一对新人道侣。¤Now only when Chong Xu and Lin Mu Xue each drink half of the bitter wine in the vessel, and then change the vessel and drink it all, Tong Yu will announce the completion of the fm ceremony, and the two newcomers will become a new couple in the presence of all the giants of the righteous path in Ning Province.
只见大殿左右有侍从持铜色盆而出，行至新人旁乃持盆站定。¤I saw that there were attendants holding bronze-colored basins out of the main hall to the left and right, and walked to the newcomers and stood with the basins.
趁着他们忙着争吵，没有在意屋外的情况，你选择了悄然离去，只听见背后传来“秘宝”、“雪儿“等字眼。¤The first thing you can do is to take advantage of the fact that they were too busy arguing to care about the situation outside the house, and you chose to leave quietly, only to hear the words secret treasure and Xue'er coming from behind you.
我前些日子发现了一个元婴妖兽的洞窟，但当时有事在身没能摸清对方的底细，现在有了些空闲于是想找{$NickName}一同探访一番。¤I discovered a cave of the Nascent Soul monster a few days ago, but at the time I was busy and couldn't find out the details of the other party. Now that I have some free time, I want to find {$NickName} to visit together.
哼，闯我大典，天大的事也饶你不得！受死！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Hmph, intruding on my grand ceremony, you can't be spared even if it's a big deal! Suffer death!!! {You look in the direction Ni XuXin is pointing.}
哼，才不是。¤Hmm, it's not.
自礼成起，你二人当是福祸同担，不分...¤Since the ceremony was completed, you two should be the same blessing and disaster, do not share ...
行合卺礼！¤Perform the fm ceremony!
其实是我发现了一个元婴妖兽的洞窟，当时有事在身没能摸清对方的底细，现在有了些空闲于是想找你一同探访一番。¤In fact, I discovered a cave of the Nascent Soul monster. At that time, I was in trouble and couldn't find out the details of the other party. Now that I have some free time, I want to visit you together.
只见殿内俪皮高挂，霞披加身。熙攘宾客，列作左右。仙果珍肴，目接不暇。又有醉仙甘露，令人神醉心迷。直教人感慨林府与星宫不愧为宁州豪门。¤I can see that the hall is hanging high, the haze cloak plus body. The guests were all around. Immortal fruits and delicacies, the eyes can not stop. There are also drunken immortal nectar, people are intoxicated and fascinated. It makes people feel that the Lin House and the Star Palace are worthy of the Ning Province gentry.
多有冒犯，还请前辈恕罪。但晚辈也是不得已才为之。¤I'm sorry to have offended you, please forgive me. The first thing you need to do is to get rid of it.
不知{$Lin}说的秘境是？¤I don't know what the secret realm {$Lin} is talking about?
冲虚散人与林沐雪席地而坐，各自取案上灵鹿肉，分而食之。¤The person who is the owner of the book and Lin Mu Xue sat on the ground and each took the meat of the deer on the case and ate it.
你们林家怎么回事，居然能在这节骨眼上出岔子？此事若是流传出去，让我们星宫颜面何存！¤What's wrong with your Lin family, how could you make a mistake at this juncture? If this matter spreads out, how can our Star Palace lose face?
大胆！区区{$Var}修士，竟敢打断我冲虚散人的结侣大典！¤How dare you! A mere {$Var} Vagrant Cultivator, how dare you interrupt my Chong Xu Sanren's couple bonding ceremony!
哈哈哈，有何不敢？你冲虚不过是一个找道侣还要找人行贿的登徒浪子而已。若不是...¤Hahahaha, why wouldn't I dare? You, Chong Xu, are nothing more than a wanderer who has to find a bribe to find a Daoist partner. If not...
在宾客的注目下，两人缓步上前，至殿上主座近旁方驻足。¤Under the attention of the guests, the two slowly stepped forward and stopped near the main seat on the hall.
晚辈有一物要交给....¤The late generation has an object to give to ....
只见冲虚散人头戴玄色爵弁立于左，弁上点缀的灵玉珠引人注目，令冲虚散人略显猥琐的笑容也变得不是那么刺眼。往下是玄色龙纹上衣与曛色下裳，缁袘则饰有金尘玉、枫楠石，交相辉映，满溢奢华。¤Just see the head of the Qingxu Sanren wears xuan-colored knight Bent standing on the left, Bent embellished with spiritual jade beads striking, so that the Qingxu Sanren slightly obscene smile also became not so harsh. Downward is the basaltic dragon pattern upper garment and twilight color lower garment, Velvet is decorated with gold dust jade, maple nan stone, intertwined, overflowing luxury.
哼，还是说正事吧。¤Hmm, let's talk about it.
{vpunch=10,0.5}且慢！！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}And slow down!!!
你来啦。我找到秘境第一时间都还想着你，对你不错吧？¤You're here. I still think of you the first time I found the secret realm, is it good for you?
来到林府大殿，俨然是一副张灯结彩的模样。与之前你和倪旭欣来观礼时别无二致。¤When you came to the main hall of the Lin House, it was just like an appearance of lights and decorations. It was no different from when you and Ni XuXin came to observe the ceremony.
遵命。¤Yes, sir.
事到如今，只能出此下策了。¤As of now, this is the only way to go.
对，若是直接去星宫，以我的修为不一定能见到冲虚散人。但若是以秘宝掩盖了气息从而假扮元婴修士上门拜访，更容易引起他的重视，从而达成目的。¤Yes, if I go directly to the Star Palace, I may not be able to see the Chongxu scattered people with my cultivation. But if the secret treasure is used to cover up the breath and pretend to be a cultivator of Nascent Soul to visit, it will be easier to attract his attention and achieve the goal.
倒也不是没有可能。¤It's not impossible.
那如果请他出关，能否解决林家的危机？¤Then if he is invited to leave the customs, can the crisis of the Lin family be solved?
心儿，你可是让我们一顿好找啊，全天星城的人都在陪你玩捉迷藏呢。¤Xin'er, you gave us a good meal. All the people in Star City are playing hide-and-seek with you.
既然{$lin}如此确信，姑且就算是这样吧。¤Since {$lin} is so convinced, let it be the case.
首先天星城的收入较宁州其他几座大城还算正常，但相比之前也确实是衰减不少，林家难辞其咎。其次无惑大长老与冲虚师徒皆是元婴修为，而林家只有家主，影响力总归还是低了些。二者相合之下，我才会认为宫主会站在无惑大长老那边。¤First of all, the income of Sky Star City is relatively normal compared to other big cities in Ning Province, but it has indeed declined a lot compared to before, and the Lin family is to blame. Secondly, the Great Elder Wuhuo and Chongxu Master and Apprentice are both Nascent Soul cultivation bases, while the Lin family has only the head of the family, so the influence is still lower. When the two are in harmony, I will think that the Palace Master will stand on the side of the Great Elder Wuhuo.
为了此事，苗矮长老还与冲虚散人过了十数招。但可能是冲虚刚入元婴，境界有些不稳，所以最后只是以苗矮长老轻伤收尾。¤For this matter, Elder Miao Ai also tried dozens of tricks with Chongxu Sanren. But it may be that Chongxu had just entered the Nascent Soul, and his realm was a little unstable, so in the end, he only ended up with a slight injury to Elder Miao Ai.
{$lin}不必客气，之前我坏了冲虚的奸计，恐怕他对付完林家，也是要找我麻烦。¤{$lin}You're welcome, I broke Chongxu's treachery before, and I'm afraid he will also trouble me after dealing with the Lin family.
你带着玉简赶到长老堂，通羽上人正在与苗矮上人不知在聊些什么。¤You rush to the Hall of Elders with the jade slip, and Lord Tong Yu is chatting with Lord Miao Dwarf about something.
抱歉，耽搁了一会，辛苦心儿了。¤Sorry for the delay, it's been hard work.
哼，你还想有下次！老三也是脾气好，找了你这么久还带来长老堂来等通羽处罚，要是我就先罚你面壁三年！¤Hum, you want to have a next time! Old three is also good-tempered, looking for you for so long still brought the Hall of Elders to wait for the Tong Yu punishment, if I would first punish you face the wall for three years!
她是我此前结识的一位星宫修士，据她自己所言，好像是星宫宫主的弟子。¤She is an Xinggong cultivator that I met before. According to her own words, she seems to be the disciple of Xinggong Palace Master.
唔，倒是有一点让我很疑惑。¤Well, there is one thing that puzzles me.
没什么，我仔细考虑了一下，还是有些欠妥。¤It's nothing, I thought about it carefully, but it's still a bit inappropriate.
就目前的情形而言，恐怕宫主会站在无惑大长老那边。¤As far as the current situation is concerned, I am afraid that the palace lord will stand on the side of the elder Wuhuo.
正是。¤Exactly.
（还是去别处找找吧。）¤（It's better to look elsewhere.）
若有其他办法，还是不要如此直接为好。¤If there is any other way, it is better not to be so direct.
此计的确不错。但正如心儿所说，宫主一向在乎星宫的颜面，{FirstName}道友若与冲虚散人在星宫中战斗，难免会被天星城中的其他修士察觉。若是传开，事后定会{color=#d0380a}引起宫主不悦{/color}。¤This count is really good. But as Xin'er said, the palace master has always cared about the face of the star palace. If fellow Daoist {FirstName} is fighting with the Chongxu scattered people in the star palace, it will inevitably be noticed by other cultivators in Tianxing City. If it spreads, it will {color=#d0380a}displease the Palace Master{/color} afterwards.
苗矮显然是有些不满，但还是把剩下的话吞了回去。¤Miao Dwarf is obviously a bit dissatisfied, but still swallowed the rest of the words back.
而这冲虚散人，本来几十年不见我还当他身死道消了。但父亲这一闭关后他又冒了出来，而且还不知如何突破到了元婴境。¤And this rushing vacant person, who I haven't seen for decades, thought he was dead and disappeared. But after his father's retreat, he came out again, and he didn't know how to break through to Nascent Soul Realm.
竟敢趁我不在闯入我的居所，今日你难逃一死！¤How dare you break into my residence while I am not here, you will die today!
未曾交换过。但据我所知，她极度反感双修采补之术。我们只需放出话去，天星城周遭有邪修滥用此类功法，定会引星道友过来。¤never exchanged. But as far as I know, she is extremely disgusted with the technique of double repair. We just need to speak out, there are evil cultivators around Tianxing City who abuse this kind of exercise, and they will definitely lead the Xingdao friends to come.
但...但是...唔，既然你有信心，那就交给你了。¤But...but...well, since you're confident, it's up to you.
见你已是下定决心，通羽上人也不再说什么，只是递给你一个满是感激的眼神。¤Seeing that you have made up your mind, Master Tong Yu didn't say anything, just gave you a grateful look.
行事诡越？{$lin}为何这么说？¤Acting deceitfully? Why does {$lin} say that?
而且据{$lin}刚才所说，冲虚看似境界不稳，所以我怀疑...¤And according to what {$lin} just said, Chongxu seems to be unstable, so I suspect...
还是那冲虚散人。本来这几十年没见他，还以为早就身死道消了。¤Or the rushing vacant person. I hadn't seen him for decades, and I thought he had died long ago.
通羽长老，你终于来了。我把你之前的分析都告诉{FirstName}{$NickName}了，但还忘了一些，嘿嘿。¤Elder Tongyu, you are finally here. I told {FirstName}{$NickName} all of your previous analysis, but I forgot some, hehe.
闻言你也是随意找了个座位坐下，开始闭目养神，静候今日的正主来到。¤You are also randomly looking for a seat to sit down, began to close their eyes to rest, waiting for today's master to come.
哼，那去忙你的吧。¤Well, then go do your work.
{$lin}，何事找我？¤{$lin}, what's with me?
心儿的事先放着吧。{FirstName}小友，还是让我们来说说今天的正事吧。¤The first thing you need to do is put your heart on hold. {FirstName}You, let's talk about today's business.
他一个{$lin}修士，能...¤He's a {$lin} cultivator who can...
真是妙计，但...太让你冒险了...算上宫主，星宫可是有三位元婴强者坐镇...若是出了意外...¤It's a good idea, but... it's too risky for you... Counting the Palace Master, there are three Nascent Soul powerhouses in the Star Palace... If something goes wrong...
嗯，通羽长老之前说是与栖云真人有关。¤Well, Elder Tongyu said before that it was related to Master Qiyun.
嗯，那我们快行动吧。¤Well, let's act quickly.
嗯...虽然我没听说过她，但宫主一向行事诡越，不合常理，私下收了弟子倒也不奇怪。¤Hmm... Although I haven't heard of her, the palace lord has always acted erratically and unreasonably, so it's not surprising that he accepted a disciple in private.
几十年前，冲虚散人为寻求突破，甚至冒险贿赂栖云真人，以求结侣后用秘术双修晋入元婴境，此事被我破坏后，他反而轻描淡写地突破了。¤A few decades ago, Chongxu Sanren even took the risk of bribing Master Qiyun in order to enter the Nascent Soul Realm with a secret technique and double cultivation.
果然还是{$NickName}靠得住，嘻嘻。¤Sure enough, {$NickName} can be trusted, hehe.
你带着玉简摸到长老堂，却发现此处空无一人，连原本常住于此的通羽上人也是不知去向。¤You touch the Elder Hall with the jade slip, but find that it is empty, even the original permanent resident here Tong Yu Shangren is also unknown.
林沐心虽觉得你的话语有些奇怪，但总算还是没有追问。而是转而与你仔细商量。¤Although Lin Muxin thought your words were a bit strange, she still didn't ask. Instead, we will discuss it carefully with you.
这两个老贼竟敢如此张狂，莫非背后有星宫宫主撑腰？¤How dare these two old thieves be so arrogant, could it be that there is the support of the Palace Master of the Star Palace behind them?
唔...嗯...以后你见到宫主本尊就知道了。¤Um... um... you will know when you see the palace master deity in the future.
多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}，嘻嘻。¤Thanks {FirstName}{$NickName}, hehehe.
怀疑冲虚为突破使用了邪术！¤Suspected that Chongxu used sorcery to break through!
先动手的是冲虚散人，联姻一事又是他们师徒理亏，料想宫主也不会太过为难我，而是会把注意转向更重要的两脉内斗一事。¤The first thing to do is to Chongxu Sanren, and the marriage is their master and apprentice.
哈哈哈，这才是林姑娘嘛。¤Hahaha, this is Miss Lin.
出发前我还想借{$lin}的秘宝一用。¤I also want to borrow {$lin}'s treasure before I go.
这个法子好，但骗她过来的话，会不会引她反感？我们还要找她帮忙呢。¤This method is good, but if you lie to her, will it make her resentful? We still need her help.
我没有把{FirstName}道友当外人！只...只是感觉我和林家亏欠你的太多...¤I don't treat fellow Daoist {FirstName} as an outsider! Just... just feel that I and the Lin family owe you too much...
{FirstName}道友请说。¤Fellow Taoist {FirstName}, please speak.
我就说嘛，不然那老贼都元婴了，怎么还和金丹期的苗矮长老实力差不多。¤I'll just say, otherwise, the old thief is already Nascent Soul, how can it still be similar to the strength of the elder Miao Ai of the Jindan stage.
等等！{vpunch=10,0.5}你身上有我房间禁制留下的气息！¤Wait! {vpunch=10,0.5}You have the breath of my room ban left on you!
但无惑真人作为冲虚散人的师父，没能有所察觉倒还挺奇怪的。¤But it's strange that Wuhuo Zhenren, as the master of Chongxu Sanren, didn't notice anything.
哎，好吧。谢谢{FirstName}道友，至少让我有了解决问题的方向。¤Hey, okay. Thank you, fellow Taoist {FirstName}, for at least giving me a direction to solve the problem.
通羽上人只是点点头后平淡地回复了栖云真人一句，而后便将话语转向林沐心。¤Master Tongyu just nodded and replied to Master Qiyun flatly, and then turned his words to Lin Muxin.
只是不管怎么说，如今无惑师徒一系有两位元婴修士，我父亲又是刚入死关，林家也只能任他师徒二人摆布...¤But no matter what, there are two Nascent Soul cultivators in the Wuhuo master and apprentice line now, and my father has just died, so the Lin family can only be at the mercy of his master and apprentice...
哎，这还得从上次的事件说起。虽然父亲最后强行出关解决了问题，但也导致他修为受损。在我晋入金丹期后，他在机缘巧合之下在外寻得一处秘境，便是再次闭关。¤Hey, this has to start with the last incident. Although the father finally forcibly exited the customs to solve the problem, it also caused his cultivation base to be damaged. After I entered the Golden Core Stage, he found a secret realm outside by chance, and he retreated again.
为何？¤Why?
后者正要开口再训斥林沐心一番，通羽上人也是及时开口，苗矮上人这才罢了。¤The latter was about to speak and reprimand Lin Muxin again, but Master Tongyu also spoke in time, and Master Miao Diao did that.
林沐心见你一副好奇的样子，不知为何脸庞飞红，赶紧将话题引回正事上。¤Seeing your curious look, Lin Muxin blushed for some reason, and quickly brought the topic back to business.
之前他虽仗着大权在握中饱私囊，但确实精于此道。自他被父亲判罚思过一甲子后，天星城也逐渐从鼎盛下滑，这才让冲虚散人抓住把柄，上门罪责林家治理不力，且借此欲大幅削弱林家的灵石份额。¤Although he relied on the power to fill his own pockets before, he is really good at this. Since he was punished by his father for thinking for a period of time, Tianxing City has gradually declined from its peak, which has allowed Chongxu Sanren to seize the handle and come to the door to accuse the Lin family of poor governance, and to use this to greatly weaken the Lin family's share of spiritual stones.
原来如此，希望这秘宝能帮你骗过他。¤It turns out that, I hope this secret treasure can help you deceive him.
如果什么？¤what if?
那道友可有计划？¤Does the Daoist have a plan?
通羽上人显然是一直在用神识关注着林府，看到你进来只是点点头，并没有说什么。而苗矮上人顺着通羽上人的目光看到有人未经允许闯入长老堂，站起身就准备发作一番。¤The top of the Tong Yu apparently has been using soul sense to focus on the Lin House, see you come in just nodded, and did not say anything. And Miao Dwarf superior followed the gaze of Tong Yu superior saw someone barging into the elder hall without permission, stood up and was ready to have a fit.
以冲虚老贼的性子肯定会愤怒难抑，但之后要怎么办呢？¤With the temperament of the old thief of Chongxu, he will definitely be angry, but what should we do after that?
冲虚散人不是好不容易突破元婴了嘛，那我作为老朋友自然是要去“恭贺”他一番。想必他见到我后，也是会愤怒难抑，此时我只需顺势激他出手。¤Chongxu Sanren finally broke through Yuan Ying, so as an old friend, I naturally want to congratulate him. Presumably when he sees me, he will be angry too. At this time, I just need to motivate him to take action.
何出此言？¤how you said that?
对于星宫来说再得一位元婴长老本是好事，但这冲虚应该是还在记恨林家，一归来就要找我们麻烦。¤It is a good thing for Xinggong to have another Nascent Soul Elder, but this Chongxu should be because he still hates the Lin family, and he will trouble us when he returns.
闻言，你心领神会地拿出玉简就要交给通羽上人。¤At that, you take out the jade slip and give it to Lord Tong Yu.
唔，我这还有几颗丹药，也一并拿去吧。那冲虚散人毕竟是元婴实力，若是{$NickName}难敌这老贼，此丹应该能派上用场。¤Well, I still have a few pills here, so let's take them too. After all, Chongxu Sanren is the strength of Nascent Soul. If {$NickName} is hard to beat this old thief, this pill should be able to come in handy.
心儿知错了，心儿下次不敢了。¤Xin'er know wrong, Xin'er next time do not dare.
不多时，满脸疲惫的栖云真人便是带着林沐心赶到了长老堂，估计是在寻找林沐心时受到了后者顽强抵抗。栖云真人对林沐心不敢全力出手，但林沐心可没这困扰，后者作为林家二小姐又不乏强力法宝傍身，因此对前者造成了不少麻烦。¤Not long after, the exhausted Master Qiyun brought Lin Muxin to the Elder Hall. It was estimated that he was stubbornly resisted by the latter when he was looking for Lin Muxin. Master Qiyun didn't dare to use his full strength against Lin Muxin, but Lin Muxin didn't have this trouble. As the second young lady of the Lin family, the latter had many powerful magic weapons nearby, so it caused a lot of trouble for the former.
林沐心气鼓鼓地别过头去，不再理会你。但你能感觉到她还在悄悄地用余光留意你的神情。¤Lin Mu angrily turned his head away and ignored you. But you can feel her still quietly paying attention to your expression out of the corner of your eye.
唔...这个...应该不至于吧...¤Um...this...it shouldn't be...
但前些日子我突破到金丹前期后，父亲恰巧在外寻得一宝地闭关。这冲虚散人又是冒了出来，甚至还突破到了元婴初期。¤But a few days ago, after I broke through to the early stage of Jindan, my father happened to find a treasure outside and retreated. This Chongxu Sanren appeared again, and even broke through to the initial stage of Nascent Soul.
不用担心，星道友可不是在意这些的人。要知道第一次见面时，我可是...咳，总之，不会有问题的，放心吧。¤Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Star is not someone who cares about these things. You have to know that when we first met, I was...cough, in short, there will be no problem, don't worry.
大长老，栖云把二小姐带回来了。¤The first elder, Quyun brought back the second young lady.
{FirstName}道友刚才与心儿是说到宫主了吧。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName} and Xin'er were talking about the Palace Master just now.
苗矮，坐下。{FirstName}小友也是受老夫所邀前来商议要事，不得无礼。¤Miao Shorty, sit down. {FirstName}You are also invited by the Patriarch to come and discuss important matters, you must not be rude.
那，莫不是林家被冲虚散人抓到了什么把柄？¤Then, could it be that the Lin family was caught by the Chongxu scattered people?
栖云和心儿的捉迷藏也差不多该结束了，小友先休息一会吧。¤Quyun and Xin's hide-and-seek should almost be over, little friend first rest for a while.
如...如果...你为了林家的事受伤，即...即便...我...即便是我也会内心难安的！¤Such as...if...you get hurt because of the Lin family, that is...even...I...even I will feel uneasy!
林沐心闻言也只是装作委屈地吐了吐舌头，却被苗矮上人瞧在眼里。¤The first thing I did was to pretend to be aggrieved and spit out my tongue, but it was seen in the eyes of the short superior.
呵呵，接下来由老夫来为{FirstName}道友说明一番吧。¤Hehe, let me explain this to fellow Daoist {FirstName}.
但这些只是猜测，并没有具体的证据，恐怕无法说服宫主。¤But these are just speculations, and there is no concrete evidence, I am afraid that the Palace Master cannot be persuaded.
哼，去吧，现在就去，最好跟冲虚同归于尽，这样就既能达成目标也不用听你损我了。¤Hmph, go, go now, it's better to die with Chongxu, so that you can achieve your goal without listening to you hurt me.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，你来了。¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, here you are.
之后我就顺势激他出手即可。¤After that, I can just urge him to take action.
嗯...确实不无可能。据我所知，修士突破至元婴境时要直面心魔，冲虚散人此前在林府的莽撞表现是有些遭心魔扰乱，道心未恢复的症状。当时直觉此人突破后对林家的恨意愈加深切，但不知缘由，经道友提起后再一想便是了然。¤Hmm... that's not impossible. As far as I know, when a cultivator breaks through to the Nascent Soul Realm, he has to face the demons, and the reckless performance of the Chongxu Sanren in the Lin Mansion is a symptom of being disturbed by the demons, and the Dao heart has not recovered. At that time, it was intuition that this person's hatred for the Lin family became more and more profound after the breakthrough, but I didn't know the reason, and it became clear after a Taoist friend mentioned it.
这么关心别人可不像{$lin}，我都差点以为眼前的是林沐雪姑娘了哈哈哈。¤It's not like {$lin} caring about others so much, I almost thought it was Miss Lin Muxue in front of me hahaha.
最终决定把传播消息的任务交给林沐心，而你则是选择在林府休息几日，等候星铃儿找上门来。¤In the end, it was decided to hand over the task of spreading the news to Lin Muxin, but you chose to rest in the Lin Mansion for a few days, waiting for Xing Linger to come to the door.
什么叫算这样，我可是有根据的，就是...就是...哼，反正我肯定是对的！¤I have a basis for what it means to be like this, that is... just... Hmph, I'm definitely right anyway!
真是妙计。¤What a neat trick.
哦？你是想在去星宫的时候掩盖自己的气息？¤Oh? Are you trying to cover up your breath when you go to the star palace?
宫主在百余年前到达元婴大圆满境后，虽说会在家主及无惑大长老的协助下处理部分宫内事务，但更多时间还是在闭关。¤After the Palace Master arrived at the Nascent Soul Great Perfection Realm more than a hundred years ago, although he would handle some of the internal affairs with the assistance of the Master and the Great Elder Wuhuo, he still spent more time in seclusion.
此计不错。但正如心儿所说，宫主一向在乎星宫的颜面，{FirstName}道友若与冲虚散人在星宫中战斗，难免会被天星城中的其他修士察觉。若是传开，事后定会{color=#d0380a}引起宫主不悦{/color}。¤This count is good. But as Xin'er said, the palace master has always cared about the face of the star palace. If fellow Daoist {FirstName} is fighting with the Chongxu scattered people in the star palace, it will inevitably be noticed by other cultivators in Tianxing City. If it spreads, it will {color=#d0380a}displease the Palace Master{/color} afterwards.
但...这种状态的冲虚散人对你肯定不会手下留情的...若是...¤But... the Chongxu scattered people in this state will definitely not be merciful to you... If...
你有那个什么星...星铃儿的传音符么？¤Do you have that celestial...xing linger's voice transmission?
真是妙计，但...太让你冒险了...算上宫主，星宫可是有三位元婴强者坐镇...而你都还没到元婴期...¤It's a good idea, but... it's too risky for you... Counting the palace lord, there are three Nascent Soul powerhouses in the Star Palace... and you haven't even reached the Nascent Soul stage...
心爱的徒儿好不容易突破至元婴，无惑真人高兴还不来不及，怎么会想这么多呢。而且{size=28}我和{/size}{size=27}林家{/size}{size=26}几位{/size}{size=25}长老{/size}{size=23}之前{/size}{size=21}不也{/size}{size=19}没{/size}{size=18}想{/size}{size=17}到{/size}{size=16}嘛{/size}{size=15}...{/size}¤The beloved disciple finally broke through to Nascent Soul, and it was too late for the real Wuhuo to be happy, how could he think so much. Moreover, {/size=28}me and {/size}{size=27}the Lin family{/size}{size=26}{/size}{size=25}elders{/size}{size=23}before{ /size}{size=21}No {/size}{size=19}No{/size}{size=18}Want to go from {/size}{size=17} to {/size}{size=16} {/size}{size=15}...{/size}
冲虚散人刚突破元婴，我以此为由头上门“恭贺”他一番。之后我再寻觅良机透漏自己曾插手联姻一事。¤Chongxu Sanren just broke through Nascent Soul, I used this as an excuse to go to the door to congratulate him. After that, I looked for a good opportunity to reveal that I had intervened in the marriage.
那你有没有想到什么计划呀。¤So have you come up with any plans?
星宫宫主虽是处深关之中，但闭关之人对战斗造成的灵气波动甚是敏感，可以籍此引她出关。¤Although the Palace Master of Star Palace is in a deep pass, people who are in seclusion are very sensitive to the fluctuations of spiritual energy caused by battle, and they can use this to lead her out of the pass.
而十余年前宫主便已是入关，至今未出关，也无人知晓何时会出关。所以宫主更可能并不知道冲虚散人此次的所为。¤The palace lord had already entered the customs more than ten years ago, and has not yet exited the customs, and no one knows when he will exit the customs. Therefore, it is more likely that the palace lord did not know what Chongxu Sanren did this time.
他看到你一个{$lin}修士却大刺刺地坐在这里，显然也是有些奇怪，但终于还是没有询问什么。¤He was obviously a little weird to see you, a {$lin} cultivator, sitting here, but he didn't ask anything.
我怎么可能会把{$NickName}当外人！只...只是感觉我和林家亏欠你的太多...¤How could I possibly take {$NickName} as an outsider! Only... It just feels like I and the Lin family owe you so much...
辛苦了。¤Thanks for your hard work.
我也不知道啦！宫主她就是对林家还不错的，肯定不会站在冲虚老贼那边！¤I don't know either! Palace Master, she is not bad to the Lin family, she will definitely not stand on the side of the old thief of Chongxu!
没事，通羽长老来得正好。¤It's okay, Elder Tongyu came just right.
就在林沐心苦思冥想该怎么说服你相信她时，林家大长老通羽上人适时出现在门口。¤Just when Lin Mu was thinking about how to convince you to believe her, the Lin family's chief elder, Venerable Tong Yu, appeared at the door at the right time.
星铃儿？那是谁？我怎么没听说过。¤Star Bell? Who is that? How did I not hear it being said.
嗯，但我们可以以此为借口唤宫主出关。宫主一向在乎星宫的名誉，定是会深入调查此事。只是...冲虚散人恐怕会密切关注林家人，不让我们有机会接触宫主...¤Well, but we can use this as an excuse to call the palace lord out of the customs. The palace master has always cared about the reputation of the star palace, and will definitely investigate this matter in depth. It's just... I am afraid that the Chongxu Sanren will pay close attention to the Lin family and prevent us from having the opportunity to contact the palace master...
但，如果...¤but if...
这些日子你因无其他要事，便留在林府养伤。一开始林沐心还耐着性子照顾你，但几天过后她终于是撂了挑子，倒是林沐雪还会每天多次来客房嘘寒问暖。¤These days, because you have nothing else to do, you stay in the Lin Mansion to recuperate. In the beginning, Lin Muxin was patient and took care of you, but after a few days, she finally gave up, but Lin Muxue would come to the guest room several times a day to ask for warmth.
距上次探访冥蛛洞窟已是半月有余，林沐心被偷袭时留下的神识创伤已是近乎痊愈。¤It has been more than half a month since the last time I visited the Nether Spider Cave, and the trauma of Lin Muxin's consciousness left by the sneak attack has almost healed.
这些日子你因无其他要事，便留在林府作陪，虽说是被林沐心趁机呼来喝去，但回怼时的她反应也是让你乐在其中。¤These days, because you have nothing else to do, you stay in the Lin Mansion to accompany you. Although Lin Muxin took the opportunity to call and drink, but her reaction when she replied also made you happy.
这些日子你因无其他要事，便留在林府养伤。一开始林沐心还耐着性子照顾你，但几天过后她终于是怀疑你在把她当下人使唤，而撂了挑子。丢给你两个林家的炼气期弟子后，就去为林家和星宫的事务操心了。¤These days, because you have nothing else to do, you stay in the Lin Mansion to recuperate. At first Lin Muxin took care of you patiently, but after a few days, she finally suspected that you were using her as someone else, so she gave up. After throwing it to you two disciples of the Lin family in the Qi refining period, I went to worry about the affairs of the Lin family and Xinggong.
（应该差不多了，去外面看看吧。）¤(It should be almost the same, let's go outside and take a look.)
距上次探访冥蛛洞窟已是半月有余，你为救林沐心留下的神识创伤也是已经痊愈。¤It has been more than half a month since the last time you visited the Nether Spider Cave, and the spiritual wound you left to save Lin Muxin has also healed.
而你则是觉得林家弟子过于无趣，找了个理由将两人支开后，每天在林府清修。¤On the other hand, you think that the disciples of the Lin family are too boring, and after finding a reason to separate them, you clean up in the Lin Mansion every day.
仙师有何吩咐？{w}{w=0.5}¤What are the immortal master's orders? {w}{w=0.5}
长老会是林家的权力枢纽，家族里大大小小的事情都必须经过长老会的首肯。¤The Council of Elders is the power hub of the Lin family, and all matters large and small in the family must be approved by the Council of Elders.
仙长平日里自然可以随意出入，但今日长老会正商议要事，还请仙长暂且回避，以免引起不必要的麻烦。¤I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get in and out of the house, but today the Elders' Council is discussing important matters, so I'd like to ask you to stay away so as not to cause unnecessary trouble.
（这家丁说不定是林家某位长老特意派来监视我的...我得想个办法把他支开）¤(This butler may be sent by one of the Lin family elders to spy on me...) I have to think of a way to get rid of him)
大长老有金丹后期修为，实力仅在家主一人之下，同时也统管整个长老会。¤The first elder has a late Jindan cultivation and is only below the family head, and also oversees the entire council of elders.
二长老有金丹初期修为，主管家族弟子培养，功法传承等内事，对家族晚辈向来十分严厉。¤The second elder has an early Jindan cultivation, in charge of the family disciples training, techniques inherited and other internal matters, has always been very strict with the family juniors.
三老有金丹初期修为，主管家族产业，账务以及其他商业往来。¤The third elder has an early Jindan cultivation and is in charge of the family's industry, accounts and other business dealings.
听说这天星城里也有个挺大规模的坊市，常常有各地的修士来此交易。¤I heard that there is also a large scale market in the city of Tianxing, and often cultivators from all over the world come here to trade.
仙长说是的，咱们天星城的坊市那可是远近闻名，一年四季都人来人往的。¤The immortal said yes, the market in our Tianxing City is famous far and wide, people come and go all year round.
对对对，特别是你们天星城那特产的醉仙酿，传说是以灵泉所酿，香醇无比。¤Yes, yes, especially your Tianxing City's special Drunken Immortal Brew, which is said to be made from a spiritual spring and is incredibly fragrant.
我来天星城这几日倒还未曾去尝试如此美味，实在是遗憾。¤I haven't tried it in the past few days, which is a pity.
反正今日你们长老会在议事，我在府中待着也是闲来无事，正好去那坊市逛逛。¤Anyway, today your elders' meeting is in session, so I have nothing to do in my house, so I'd better go to the market and have a stroll.
这...可是长老交代...¤This... But the elders explained...
既然兄弟你有难为之处，那我也不给你添麻烦了。¤Since you're having a hard time, I won't give you any trouble.
不如这样，这50灵石呢你先收着，替我去那坊市里买上几壶好酒来，多下来的钱就当赏你的辛苦费。¤How about this, you take this 50 spirit stones, go to the market for me to buy a few pots of good wine, the extra money will be your reward for your hard work.
那家丁不过一介凡人，何曾见过这么一大笔的灵石，顿时面露喜色的点头应允，收下了灵石便往府外走去了...¤The butler was a mere mortal and had never seen such a large sum of spirit stones before, so he nodded with joy and accepted the stones and went outside the house...
如此一来，我也就可以安心在这府内待着了，可好？¤In this way, I can stay in this house without worrying, okay?
怎么，难道这便是林府的待客之道么？¤What, is this the way the Lin House treats its guests?
我可是你们二小姐的朋友，你敢这般阻拦我的正常活动，等二小姐怪罪下来，你担待得起么？¤I am your second lady's friend, you dare to stop my normal activities like this, when the second lady blames you, can you afford to take the blame?
仙...仙长息怒，小的不敢...¤Immortal... Don't be angry, I dare not...
仙长言重了，若仙长执意要出门，还请待小的像长老禀报一番。¤If you insist on going out, please wait for me to report to the elders.
哼！¤Humph!
（不好...若是惊动了长老们，恐怕反而坏了二小姐的安排...）¤(It's not good...) If you alert the elders, I'm afraid you'll ruin the arrangement of the Second Miss...)
算...算了，倒也不必如此兴师动众，我回屋休息便是。¤Forget it... I don't need to make such a fuss, I'll just go back to my room and rest.
仙师还有何吩咐？¤What else can I do for you?
（这家丁可能已经对我有了警觉...还要强行出门倒是打草惊蛇了...）¤(This houseboy may have been alerted to me...) I'd better go out and scare the snake...)
仙师还请自便。¤Please make yourself comfortable.
（也不知天星城中有何变故，还是于此休息一番，调整好状态准备应对吧，就不出门闲逛了。）¤（I also do not know what changes in the City of Heavenly Stars, or here to rest a bit, adjust the state to prepare to deal with it, so do not go out to wander.）
夜半时分你正准备熄灯时，房间的衣柜里传来窸窸窣窣的声音。¤At midnight you were about to turn out the lights when a rustling sound came from the closet in your room.
大半夜的...应该不是闹鬼吧？¤In the middle of the night... It is not haunted, right?
不管三七二十一，你拿起床边的木棍拉开柜门就是一顿乱舞。¤No matter what, you pick up the wooden stick next to the bed and pull open the closet door is a dance.
哎呀！！！！¤Oops ！！！！
你心下一惊，赶紧把棍子扔到一边装作无事发生的样子。¤You were shocked and hurriedly threw the stick to the side and pretended that nothing had happened.
就算我来得晚了点你也不至于记恨成这样吧！¤Even if I came a little late you do not have to hold a grudge like this!
算了...先不说这个，你有什么收获吗？¤Never mind... Let's not talk about that, did you get anything?
喀啦——¤Kara--
衣柜门被猛地一下推开，你吓了一跳，借着烛光勉强看清来人。¤The closet door was violently pushed open, you jumped, through the candlelight barely see the visitor.
哎呦，挖地道可累死我了！¤I'm tired of digging tunnels!
地道？¤Tunnels?
我把屋子里原来的暗道通到客房的衣柜里来了，先不说这个，你有什么收获吗？¤I put the original dark tunnel in the house to the guest room closet, let's not talk about this, you have any gains?
林家与星宫的联姻恐怕有内情。¤I'm afraid there is something inside the marriage between the Lin family and the Star Palace.
你把白天听到的内容向林沐心复述一遍。¤You repeat to Lin MuXin what you heard during the day.
听你的意思，长老堂内部对这件事情也还存在分歧。苗矮与栖云长老的态度，也很是可疑...¤From what you heard, there is still disagreement within the Elders Hall on this matter as well. The attitude of the Miao Dwarf and Quyun elders is also very suspicious...
{color=#d0380a}通羽{/color}长老可能知道些内情，他一贯疼爱我，从他这里说不定可以获得一些有用的信息。¤{color=#d0380a}Tong Yu{/color} elder may know some inside information, he consistently loves me, from him we may be able to get some useful information.
你们又聊了一阵，从林沐心口中你得知林家大哥如今在外历练，而大姐也被严加看管，无法接近。想要弄清原委，救出大姐，便只有靠你们两人自己想办法了。¤You talked for a while, and from Lin MuXin you learned that the elder brother of the Lin family is now away on a training trip, and that the elder sister is being closely guarded and cannot be approached. If you want to find out the reason and save Big Sister, you can only rely on the two of you to find a way.
你们简单地制定了计划，约定等弄清楚更多的消息后，再做打算。¤You simply made a plan and agreed to wait for more information before making plans.
呼，这临时挖的地道走起来可真费劲。¤Phew, this makeshift tunnel is really hard to walk.
白天我房外的家丁可能是被派来监视我的，为了防止打草惊蛇，我便一直待在屋内没有出去。¤The family man outside my room during the day was probably sent to spy on me, so I stayed inside to prevent spooking the snake.
你把白天和家丁对话的内容向林沐心复述了一遍。¤You repeated the daytime conversation with the butler to Lin MuXin.
哼，若没些古怪，他们如此防备着你做什么。这次和星宫联姻的背后肯定还有什么我们不知道的隐情！¤If there was nothing odd about it, what would they be so wary of you for? There must be something behind this marriage with the Star Palace that we don't know about!
夜半时分，衣柜后又传来“咚咚咚”的敲门声，你连忙拉开柜门...¤The door was knocking again at midnight from behind the closet, and you hastily opened it...
怎么样，你今天有没有什么新的发现？¤What do you think? Did you find anything new today?
你把今天和通羽长老对话的内容向林沐心复述了一遍。¤You repeated the conversation you had with Elder Tong Yu to Lin MuXin today.
你把今天和苗矮长老对话的内容向林沐心复述了一遍。¤You repeated to Lin MuXin the content of today's conversation with Elder Miao Dwarf.
原来通羽长老早就知道我们在调查此事了...可他现在到底是什么态度呢？¤So Elder Tong Yu already knew that we were investigating this matter... But what exactly is his attitude now?
长老会里就数苗矮长老最固执死板，从小我就讨厌他了！¤Elder Miao is the most stubborn and rigid in the Council of Elders, and I've hated him since I was a kid!
原来如此...那你心中目前有没有怀疑的对象？¤I see... Then do you have any suspicions in your mind at the moment?
通羽长老统管长老会，若他真有心阻止，又怎么会说服不了其它长老？¤Elder Tong Yu is in charge of the Council of Elders, if he really wants to stop it, how can he not convince the other Elders?
不可能，通羽长老素来疼爱我和姐姐，我不相信他会做出这种事。¤No way, Elder Tong Yu has always loved me and my sister, I don't believe he would do such a thing.
何况按照我们林家长老会的传统，若是另外两位长老都赞同，大长老一人反对也是没有用的。¤In addition, according to the tradition of the Lin Family Elders' Council, if the other two elders agree, it is useless for the eldest elder to oppose it alone.
苗矮长老态度最为强硬，如今也是他在严加看管大姐，他的嫌疑最大。¤Elder Miao Dwarf has the strongest attitude, and now he is also the one who is keeping a close watch on Big Sister, and he is the most suspicious.
你说的有些道理，但细细想来，以苗矮长老的性格而言，这次的态度倒是没有什么可奇怪的。¤You make some sense, but when you think about it, in terms of Elder Miao Shor's character, there is nothing surprising about his attitude this time.
我还听说，一百多年前，苗矮长老亲手把自己的大女儿也嫁入了星宫。¤I also heard that more than a hundred years ago, Elder Miao Shorty personally married his eldest daughter into the Star Palace as well.
栖云长老原本是主管家族财务外事的，此番却对你们的婚事态度如此重视，他最为可疑。¤Elder Quyun was originally in charge of the family's financial and external affairs, but this time, his attitude towards your marriage is so important, he is most suspicious.
我和你的想法一样！所以趁着今日栖云长老不在府内，我偷偷调查了家族的账本，果然发现有很多明显的漏洞。¤I think the same as you! So taking advantage of the fact that Elder Quyun is not in the house today, I secretly investigated the family's books, and indeed found many obvious loopholes.
我反倒觉得栖云长老最为可疑，他原本是主管家族财务外事的，这次对我们的婚事如此上心，就有些反常。¤I think that Elder Quyun is the most suspicious, he was originally in charge of the family's financial affairs, this time so concerned about our marriage, it is a bit unusual.
所以趁着今日栖云长老不在府内，我偷偷调查了家族的账本，果然发现有很多明显的漏洞。¤So while Elder Quyun is not in the house today, I secretly investigated the family's books and found a lot of obvious loopholes.
要是等爹爹出关发现此事，栖云长老定然要受重罚。¤If father finds out about this, Elder Qiyun will definitely be punished heavily.
原来如此...所以他很有可能就是因为这个才与星宫的长老私下里做了什么交易。¤So that's how it is... So it's likely that this is why he made some kind of private deal with the elders of the Star Palace.
不管是不是这样，总之有账本在手，我们拿着证据与各位长老当面对峙，看他还如何狡辩！¤Whether this is the case or not, anyway, with the account book in hand, we take the evidence and confront the elders face to face, see how he can still sophistry!
由于知道事情的大致真相，你也没担心太多，只是打算就此在客房中修炼几天。¤Since you know the general truth of the matter, you didn't worry too much, just plan to cultivate in the guest room for a few days on this.
(现在还不是休息的时候。）¤（Now is not the time to rest.）
你眼看林家姐妹并未急着提到结果，便只是饮酒赏花，闲聊几句无关的话题而已。偶尔远离清修，又有佳人在侧，倒也称得上是惬意。¤You can see that the Lin sisters are not in a hurry to mention the result, they are just drinking and enjoying flowers and chatting a few unrelated topics. Occasionally far away from Qingxiu, and there are beautiful people on the side, it can be called comfortable.
哼，瞧你装的，越阶挑战元婴修士都成举手之劳了。要不是打不过你，我一定要消消你的气焰。¤Hmph, look at what you are pretending to do, it's easy to challenge the Nascent Soul cultivator by leaps and bounds. If I can't beat you, I must dispel your arrogance.
看着林沐心一副气鼓鼓要动手的样子，你不禁大笑出声，但也结结实实地挨了好几下她粉嫩的拳头。¤Seeing Lin Muxin's angrily wanting to do something, you couldn't help laughing out loud, but you also slammed into her pink fist several times.
（孤身苦修是为何么？）¤(What is the solitary penance?)
倒是林家姐妹来到你近旁坐下。料是星宫宫主已经了解完事情经过，整个事件也是尘埃落定罢。¤Instead, the Lin family sisters came to sit next to you. It is expected that the Lord of the Star Palace has already understood what happened, and the whole incident has settled down.
你眼看林沐心并未急着提到结果，便只是饮酒赏花，闲聊几句无关的话题而已。偶尔远离清修，又有佳人在侧，倒也称得上是惬意。¤Seeing that Lin Muxin didn't mention the result in a hurry, she just drank and enjoyed the flowers and chatted a few unrelated topics. Occasionally far away from Qingxiu, and there are beautiful people on the side, it can be called comfortable.
老头子，若是你处于瓶颈之下久不得突破，又寿元将尽，会像冲虚一般不择手段么？¤Old man, if you are under the bottleneck for a long time and cannot break through, and your lifespan is about to expire, will you be unscrupulous like rushing into the void?
拜见过长老后，倪旭欣便是被其父倪振东留在了大殿里，只留你一人在林府闲逛。¤After paying respect to the elders, Ni XuXin was left in the main hall by his father, Ni Zhendong, leaving you alone to hang out in the Lin House.
不过是举手之劳而已，{$Lin}不必客气。¤It's just a small gesture, {$Lin} is welcome.
闲聊许久后，林沐心终于是按捺不住，主动提到你帮林家解除这次危机的回报。¤After chatting for a long time, Lin Muxin finally couldn't hold back, and took the initiative to mention your reward for helping the Lin family resolve this crisis.
闻言，你装作一副身受重伤的样子连连痛哼，就差没真口吐鲜血了。¤Hearing this, you pretended to be seriously injured and groaned in pain, and you almost vomited blood.
哪呢哪呢，我去帮你拿疗伤的...好啊你，连我都敢骗，看我不把你打成重伤，这两年就留在林府疗伤吧！¤What the hell, I'm going to help you heal your wounds... Okay, you, even I dare to lie, see if I don't beat you seriously, just stay in the Lin Mansion for two years to heal!
哎哟，冲虚散人好像在我体内下了暗劲，{$Lin}快帮我看看。¤Ouch, it seems that the Chongxu Sanren has a dark energy inside me, {$Lin} help me take a look.
多谢{$NickName}出面，若不是你，此次危机恐是要让林家费尽心力，甚至让父亲修为再次受损才能解决。所以通羽长老让我吧这个储物袋交给你，算是林家的一点心意。¤Thank you {$NickName} for coming forward. If it weren't for you, this crisis would have required the Lin family to work hard, and even let the father's cultivation base be damaged again to solve it. Therefore, Elder Tongyu asked me to hand this storage bag to you, which is a little thought of the Lin family.
不似你印象中凡俗婚礼的热闹，林家内只有十数个修士三两成群的交谈着，数十个侍从忙碌着，再就是大殿中几个你看不出修为深浅的前辈。¤It's not like your impression of a mundane wedding, only a dozen Vagrant Cultivators talking in groups, dozens of attendants busy, and then a few seniors in the main hall whose cultivation level you can't tell.
天地间修仙者无数，能得偿所愿者又有几人？得之吾幸，失之亦吾命。且如今辞世千年，亲友不在，道侣弟子尽亡，老夫更是忘却孤身苦修是为何，又...嗯？有个神识异常强大的修士正在往这边来，择日再说吧。¤There are countless immortal cultivators in heaven and earth, but how many of them can get what they want? I am fortunate to get it, but I am also destined to lose it. Now that I have been dead for a thousand years, my friends and relatives are gone, and all my disciples are dead, I have forgotten why I am alone in my cultivation, and... What? There is an unusually powerful cultivator who is coming this way, let's talk about it on another day.
回到林府后，星宫宫主便是向通羽上人及林沐心等人了解情况。而你却觉得该帮的忙都已是帮完，再无兴致旁听，反倒是要一壶仙酿，在林家诸位修士的恭敬中往那辰溪薇亭去了。¤After returning to the Lin Mansion, the Palace Master of the Star Palace learned about the situation from Master Tongyu, Lin Muxin and others. However, you feel that you have already done all your help, and you are no longer interested in listening. Instead, you want a pot of immortal brew and go to the Chenxi Weiting with the respect of the cultivators of the Lin family.
看着打作一团的你二人，林沐雪也是在一旁掩嘴轻笑。¤Seeing the two of you fighting together, Lin Muxue also covered her mouth and chuckled.
哦，主位应该是给林家家主留的吧，只是不知前辈忙什么去了。¤Oh, the main seat should be reserved for the Lin family head, just do not know what the senior busy to go.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你看那大殿中左首便是林家大长老通羽上人了。右首那位我没见过，估摸着应该是星宫的某位长老吧。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, you see that the left head of the hall is the Lin family elders Tong Yu Shangren. The one at the head of the right I have not seen, I guess it should be one of the elders of the Star Palace.
（呵呵，看来老头子是真老了。）¤(Oh, it seems that the old man is really old.)
倒是林沐心来到你近旁坐下。料是星宫宫主已经了解完事情经过，整个事件也是尘埃落定罢。¤Instead, Lin Muxin came to sit next to you. It is expected that the Lord of the Star Palace has already understood what happened, and the whole incident has settled down.
不多时，你远远地看到星铃儿的身影在近旁一晃而过，却未驻足。¤Not long after, you saw the figure of Xing Ling'er passing by in the distance, but did not stop.
进入林家后，在倪旭欣的带领下，你们很快就来到林家大殿前。¤After entering the Lin family, led by Ni XuXin, you soon arrived in front of the Lin family's main hall.
你向倪旭欣所指方位望去，注意力却停留在了空着的主位上。¤You look in the direction Ni XuXin is pointing, but your attention stays on the empty main seat.
还剩下两位没介绍的就是林家的二长老苗矮上人和栖云真人了，据说这次的联姻便是他们两人促成的了，也不知其中有什么...咳咳，我们还是先去拜见诸位前辈吧。¤The two remaining unintroduced people are the second elder of the Lin family, Miao Dwarf and Qiyun, and it is said that they are the ones who made this marriage possible. Ahem, we'd better go and meet the seniors first.
那位稍显儒雅之气的老者便是公孙府大长老公孙璞，旁边与他格格不入的壮汉则是百里家家主百里邑，至于我父亲，{FirstName}{xiongdi}你也见过了。¤The Patriarch with a slightly elegant air is the grand elder of the Gongsun House, Gongsun Pu, next to the strong man who does not fit in with him is the Baili family head Baili Yi, as for my father, {FirstName}{xiongdi} you have also seen.
嗯...老夫不知道当年的自己会怎么做，但现在的话，当是不会。¤Hmm... I don't know what I would have done back then, but now, I think it's not.
你想着时间差不多了，便结束在林家的闲逛，准备回到大殿。¤Thinking it's about time, you end your wandering around the Lin family and prepare to return to the Great Hall.
你屏气凝神，悄悄地靠近长老堂...¤You hold your breath and quietly approach the Hall of Elders...
既然二妮子回来了，议亲的人选要不要换回去？¤Since Ernie is back, should we change the candidate for the marriage?
星宫的冲虚长老意下如何？¤What does Elder Chong Xu of the Star Palace think?
虽然他一开始看中的是心儿，但已经定下的婚约也不好更改。依我看还是把大妮子许给人家吧，反正...¤Although he had his eye on Xin'er at the beginning, but the marriage contract has already been set, it is not good to change. In my opinion, it is better to promise Da Ni Zi to someone else, anyway...
反正什么，栖云？¤Anyway, what, Quyun?
这几年老祖闭死关，星宫和我们的关系也有些疏远了，我也是为了家族着想...¤These years, the Patriarch closed, the Star Palace and our relationship is also a bit distant, I also for the sake of the family ...
冲虚的修为在金丹后期已经停滞多年了，他这次来提亲是为了什么你心里应该清楚。¤The cultivation level of Chong Xu in the late Jindan has been stagnant for many years, he came to propose marriage for what you should know in your heart.
通羽啊，我看你是太溺爱那两个孩子了。婚姻大事，本就应该由我们长老堂说了算。¤Tong Yu ah, I think you are too spoiled those two children. Marriage matters should have been decided by our Elders Hall.
看来几位长老内部也没有统一意见...¤It seems that there is no unified opinion within the elders...
雪儿一贯懂事，我看是不会再惹什么麻烦的，倒是心儿那丫头，哼，应该好好教育一番...¤Xue'er always knows how to behave, I don't think she will cause any more trouble, but that girl Xin'er, huh, she should be educated properly...
看来林府和星宫的联姻另有隐情...我得赶快告诉林沐心才行。¤It seems that the marriage between the Lin House and the Star Palace has another hidden agenda... I have to tell Lin MuXin quickly.
（似乎是一间空的客房，还是不要浪费时间进去看吧。）¤（It seems to be an empty guest room, so it's better not to waste time going in to see it.）
（结侣典礼似乎快开始了，我还是留下观礼吧。）¤（It seems that the couple-tying ceremony is about to begin, so I'd better stay and observe it.）
禀掌门，这便是今年在养剑池下入定时间最长的{FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}。¤Master, this is the {FirstName}{LastName}{shidi} who has been under the Sword Raising Pond for the longest time this year.
哼...¤Hmm...
哈哈哈，我看诸位还是让这位小友自己选吧。¤Hahahaha, I think you all should let this young friend choose for himself.
{FirstName}{LastName}，你悟性虽高，但修炼一途也并非只靠着天赋便能取得大成就的。¤{FirstName}{LastName}, although you have a high level of enlightenment, you can't achieve great things in the path of cultivation just by relying on your talent.
所谓重剑无锋，大巧不工，镇元剑仙一门的《奔雷决》正是我派重剑流的代表功法，传承亦有数千年，对敌时往往能够{color=#d0380a}蓄势{/color}以待，后发制人。¤The greatsword has no edge, pure strength overcomes all trickery, Swordmaster Zhengyuan’s Charging Thunder Arts is the representative technique of our sect's greatsword style. It has been passed down for thousands of years. When confronting an enemy, it waits while {color=#d0380a }Gathered Force{/color}, and then strikes with decisive force.
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一个剑匣，递给了你。¤After all, the master took out a sword box from the storage bag and handed it to you.
龙阳师兄想说什么？¤What does Brother Long Yang want to say?
如此相争...成何体统。¤Such rivalry... What a disgrace.
你走到镇元剑仙身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Swordmaster Zhenyuan and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
龙阳上人主修的是我派功法《流光真决》，对敌时能利用{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}之力大幅度提升金系法门的威能。¤Venerable Dragonlight is a master of our sect's Flowing Radiance Arts. When confronting the enemy, he can use {color=#d0380a}the Elemental Cycle{/color} to greatly enhance the power of Metal abilities.
这养剑池中所养灵剑，有不少都是我派历代天赋卓绝的长老所留遗物，蕴含他们对于大道的不同感悟。¤Many of the spiritual swords in this pond are the legacies of our sect's most gifted elders, containing their different insights into the Great Dao.
镇元师兄所言差矣，祖师当年所创功法多数都已失传，若要拿这个说事，未免...¤Most of the techniques created by our ancestors have been lost. If we want to talk about this, it would be too much...
掌门师兄所言极是。¤What Brother Master said is very true.
掌门，本届的宗门大比的结果出来了，这次夺魁的是{FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}。¤Master, the results of this year's clan competition are in, and this time the winner is {FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}.
此剑，名为中执，你收着吧。¤This sword, named Zhong Zhi, you may keep it.
不错千绝，辛苦你了。¤Not bad Chikyu, you've worked hard.
此剑匣，名为光流，乃是我年轻时所炼制的武器，今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This sword case, named Lightstream, is a weapon I made when I was young, and I will give it to you today as a gift.
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一一柄环状武器，扔给了你。¤After all, the master took out a ring-shaped weapon from the storage bag and threw it to you.
能在养剑池中坚持这些时日，说明你悟性不错，而且适合修炼我派功法。若能得妥善指点，未来至少也可有金丹期的成就。¤The fact that you have lasted in the Sword Pond for so many days shows that you have good enlightenment and are suitable for practising our school's techniques. If you can receive proper guidance, you will be able to achieve at least the Golden Dan stage in the future.
是，掌门。¤Yes, Master.
明河剑仙乃我派大长老，修为已达元婴期。他的独门功法《神剑决》在整个宁州也是独树一帜，对敌时一往无前，神通功法皆{color=#d0380a}不再以剑气伤人{/color}，但凡出手皆是杀招。¤Swordmaster Radiant River is the Grand Elder of our Sect, and is a Nascent Soul realm cultivator. His unique technique 《Divine Sword Arts》 is one of a kind in Ning Province. He is indomitable when confronting the enemy. He {color=#d0380a}no longer rely on Sword Qi{/color} to attack the enemy, but every move is deadly in its own right.
除了我以外，本门还有三名授业长老在招收弟子。千绝，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤Apart from me, our sect has three other instructing elders who are recruiting disciples. Qian Jue, you should introduce the elders to you {shidi}.
按大比的规矩，你可以从自行选择拜入在座的任意一名长老门下继续修行。千绝，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤According to the rules of the Grand Competition, you can continue your training under any of the elders present from your own choice. Qian Jie, you will introduce the elders to you {shidi}.
我所修功法乃是传承自我派祖师金虹剑仙的重剑一脉，以这小友的悟性，若是拜入我门下，将来必能将之发扬光大。¤The technique I practice is inherited from my school's ancestor, the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal's Heavy Sword lineage, and with this young friend's enlightenment, if he joins my school, he will be able to carry it forward in the future.
此剑匣，名为虹，乃是我年轻时所炼制的武器，今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This sword box, named Hong, is a weapon I made when I was young, and I will give it to you today as a gift.
你走到明河剑仙身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Swordmaster Radiant River and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
你走到龙阳上人身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Venerable Dragonlight and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
本座如今修为已达元婴期瓶颈，要专心为之后的化神做好准备，之后也不会再收弟子了。¤Now that my cultivation has reached the bottleneck at the Nascent Soul stage, I have to concentrate on preparing for the subsequent Deity Transformation, and I will not accept any more disciples after that.
不错。¤Not bad.
你的天赋虽然普通，但心性坚定，一心求道，这次能突破到筑基期，也算十分难得了。¤Although your talent is ordinary, you have a strong heart and a single-minded pursuit of the path, so it is very rare for you to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage this time.
跟我来，我这便带你去拜见掌门。¤Come with me, I'll take you to see the sect leader.
等等...{FirstName}{shidi}，是你？你成功凝结元婴了？¤Wait...{FirstName}{shidi}, is it you? Have you successfully condensed the Nascent Soul?
由于你近日在门派内的表现，你的门派职位被提升为外门执事。¤Due to your recent performance in the clan, your position has been promoted to Deacon of foreign affairs.
由于你近日在门派内的表现，你的门派职位被降为普通内门弟子。¤Due to your recent performance in the clan, your position has been reduced to an ordinary inner disciple.
能在40岁前突破筑基，{shidi}也可算是我派这一辈中的佼佼者了，未来前途不可限量啊。¤Being able to break through and build a foundation before the age of 40, {shidi} can also be regarded as the leader of my generation, and the future is boundless.
不错...能在50岁前突破筑基，未来若是得些机缘的话，能再突破至金丹期也未可知啊。¤You have? You were able to break through and establish a Foundation before the age of 50, if you get some chance in the future it should be possible to enter the Golden Core Realm in the future...
按我派的规矩，外门弟子凡是可以突破筑基，就能够晋升为我派内门弟子，并拜入我派长老门下修习。¤According to the rules of my school, any outer disciple who can break through to build a foundation can be promoted to my inner disciple, and worship under my school elders to practice.
你刚走近宗门广场，只听一道悠长洪亮的笑声传到你的耳边。¤You just approached the Zongmen Square, and only heard a long and loud laughter reach your ears.
哼，是谁？¤Huh, who is it?
由于你近日在门派内的表现，你的门派职位被降为普通外门弟子。¤Due to your recent performance in the sect, your sect position has been reduced to an ordinary outer disciple.
还不到30岁就能突破筑基，即使放眼整个宁州，{shidi}你也算年轻一辈中的佼佼者了，未来前途不可限量啊。¤You can break through and build a foundation before you are 30 years old. Even if you look at the entire Ning Province, {shidi} you are considered a leader among the younger generation, and the future is limitless.
{shidi}，既然你已晋入筑基期，就算得上是我们门派中的一股重要力量了，有些事该要告于你知晓。¤{shidi}, since you have entered the Foundation stage, you are considered an important force in our sect. There are some things that should be told to you.
由于你近日在门派内的表现，你的门派职位被提升为内门执事。¤Due to your recent performance in the clan, your position has been promoted to Deacon of internal affairs.
好！好！好！¤Good! Good! Good!
突破元婴后，你的元神实力大增，稍稍外放神识便可覆盖整个宗门，内外门数百人的情况都一览无余，竟无一人发现你。¤After breaking through the Nascent Soul, your primordial spirit's strength greatly increases. A little bit of divine consciousness can cover the entire sect, and the situation of hundreds of people in the inner and outer sects can be seen at a glance, and no one has found you.
{shidi}，你的气息...你突破到筑基期了？¤{shidi}, your qi... Have you broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm?
你好奇地扫视了一番，直到撞上另外一股强大的神识..¤You scanned it curiously, until you ran into another powerful spirit...
掌门的声音：哈哈哈哈，{FirstName}师侄，恭喜你证得金丹大道，还请来大殿一叙。¤Voice of the head: Hahahaha, {FirstName} nephew, congratulations on your attainment of Jindan Avenue, and please come to the hall to tell.
没想到{FirstName}{shidi}此番结婴如此顺利，真乃宗门之幸事，值得好好庆祝一番！{FirstName}{shidi}，请随我来大殿一叙。¤I didn't expect {FirstName}{shidi} to have such a smooth breakthrough. It is really a blessing for the sect. It is worth celebrating! {FirstName}{shidi}, please follow me to the hall.
外门弟子不得擅入宗门大殿¤Outer disciples are not allowed to enter the sect's main hall without permission
另外，门派每三十年会举办一次{color=#d0380a}宗门大比{/color}，夺魁者不仅可以直接成为内门弟子，拜入我派任一一位长老门下修习，还能获得一枚{color=#d0380a}筑基丹{/color}作为奖励。¤In addition, the sect holds a {color=#d0380a}Grand Sect Competition{/color} every thirty years. The winner can not only directly become an inner disciple, but also study under any one of our elders. They will also recieve a {color=#d0380a}Foundation Pill{/color} as a reward.
{shidi}，新入门弟子的道袍我已经派人为你取来。¤{shidi}, I have sent someone to fetch your disciples robes.
若是你还想兼修我派其它功法，可以自行去往{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}借阅。待{shidi}挑选完入门功法后，若还有什么不明白的，可以来宗门广场找我。¤If you wish to study other techniques of our sect at the same time, you can borrow them from the {color=#d0380a}Scripture Pavilion{/color} on your own. After {shidi} has picked out your introductory techniques, if there's anything else you don't understand, you can come and see me at the sect square.
化尘诀乃我教弟子必须修习的基础功法。尘，扬土也。化尘之窍在于沉可中正稳健，扬则灵动敏迅。{shidi}可配合我教其他神通，仔细体悟其中法门。¤Dust-removing technique is the basic exercise that I must practice to teach my disciples. Dust also raises the earth. The key to dust-removing lies in Shen to be stable, and Yang to be agile and quick. {shidi} can cooperate with me to teach other magical powers and understand carefully. Among the methods.
每年的七月份，我派{color=#d0380a}外门传功长老{/color}都会在宗门广场讲道授法。¤Every year in July, the {color=#d0380a}external preaching elders{/color} of our school preach and teach the Dharma in the clan square.
若是你还想兼修我派其它功法，可以自行去往{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}借阅。¤If you still want to practice exercises other than those I gave you, you can go to the{color=#d0380a}Manual Pavilion{/color} to exchange for them.
这里就是我的洞府了吧，虽然简单倒也是五脏俱全了。¤Here is my cave, right, although simple but also contains all the necessities.
除此以外，传功长老还会传授一些我派入门神通的施展技巧，{shidi}虽然已入我派内门，也可以多去听听，应该会有所收获。¤In addition to this, the Transmission Elder will also teach some of the techniques for performing our school's introductory divine abilities. {shidi} Although you have already entered our school's inner sect, you can go and listen to more of them and you should gain something.
每年的七月份，我派{color=#d0380a}外门传功长老{/color}都会在宗门广场讲道授法，{shidi}虽然已入我派内门，也可以多去听听，应该会有所收获。¤Every July, I send {color=#d0380a} outer sect elder Chuan Gong{/color} to preach the dao in the square. Although {shidi} has entered the inner sect directly, you can still go to listen. There should be some gains from doing so.
多谢师兄提点。¤Thank you brother for all the information.
多谢师姐提点。¤Thank you, Senior Sister for the point.
{shidi}虽然已入内门拜师，但这筑基丹也是极为稀有的宝贝。未来{shidi}筑基突破时若能服下几颗，可以大大提高筑基成功的概率。¤Although {shidi} has entered the inner sect, the Foundation Pill is still precious. In the future, if {shidi} can get their hands on a few of them it should improve their chances of entering Foundation Establishment.
此外，这是我教入门神通《还尘》，《化沙》，以及入门功法《化尘诀》。¤In addition, this is what I teach the introductory supernatural powers Returning the Dust, Burning the Sand, and the introductory exercise Casting the Dust.
若是你还想领悟我派其它功法神通，可以自行去往{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}借阅。¤If you still want to comprehend the magical powers of other exercises Our Sect, you can go to {color=#d0380a} Tibetan Scripture Pavilion{/color} to borrow.
好了{shidi}，你既已入我金虹剑派，务必努力修行，争取早日达到{color=#d0380a}筑基期{/color}修为，成为我派的内门弟子。¤Alright {shidi}, since you've joined my Radiant Sword Sect, you best work hard to achieve the {color=#d0380a}foundation stage{/color} cultivation base as soon as possible and become an inner disciple.
你来到剑池前，席地而坐，由数千把灵气飞剑组成的剑河在你的头顶盘旋...¤You come to the sword pond, sit on the ground, the sword river composed of thousands of flying magic swords hovering over your head...
{vpunch=10,0.5}四...四天？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Four...Four days?
恭喜{shidi}，从今日起你就是我们金虹剑派的外门弟子了，这个储物袋里装的是我派道袍和一些日常用品，你且收着。¤Congratulations {shidi}, From this day forth you are an outer disciple of our Radiant Sword Sect. This storage bag contains the Taoist robe of our sect and some daily necessities, its yours now.
你对金之道的感悟略微提升了。¤Your perception of the Golden Way has slightly improved.
对于每个剑修而言，他们感悟到的剑意都不一样，就像这剑阵中的数十万把灵气飞剑，个性也各不相同。有的灵动飘逸，有的煞气逼人...¤For each sword repairman, the sword intent they perceive is different, just like the hundreds of thousands of aura flying swords in this sword array, and their personalities are also different. Some are agile and elegant, and some are compelling. ...
{vpunch=10,0.5}五...五天？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Five...five days?
不过想像这般进入顿悟的状态，也只有第一次体悟剑阵时才有这样的机会。{shidi}能够入定六天，在外门弟子中已经算很不错的成绩，当年师兄我也只不过坚持了十天罢了。¤But imagine entering a state of enlightenment like this, and only the first time you experience the sword formation can you have such a chance. {shidi} can enter the concentration for six days, and it is already a very good result among the outer disciples. It lasted ten days.
随着时间的流逝，剑阵中所蕴含的磅礴剑意也愈发凌厉起来，你只感到威压越来越强大，拼命运转灵气想要与之抗衡，豆大的汗珠从你的额头低落，正当你快要坚持不住时，一股外力将你强行从入定的状态中打断。¤With the passage of time, the majestic sword intent contained in the sword formation has become more and more fierce. You only feel the coercion getting stronger and stronger. You want to fight fate and aura to fight against it. The big sweat drops from yours. The forehead is lowered, just when you are about to be unable to hold on, an external force will forcibly interrupt you from the state of concentration.
你有些茫然地接过储物袋，环顾广场的四周，发现白天熙熙攘攘来参加仙资大会的人群都已经不见了。¤You took the storage bag in a daze, looked around the square, and found that the bustling crowd of people who came to the Fairy Treasure Conference during the day had disappeared.
你闭上眼深吸了一口气，将灵气注入剑池，努力让自己的心情平静下来，很快便进入了入定的状态...¤You closed your eyes and took a deep breath, poured aura into the sword pond, tried to calm your mind, and soon entered a state of concentration...
你谨慎地将灵气注入剑池，霎时间原本如镜无波的表面沸腾起来，迸射出强烈的光芒。一柄飞剑从剑阵之中挣脱而出，在半空中盘旋数周后停留在了你的面前。¤You cautiously inject your spiritual energy into the sword pond, and the surface that was originally like a mirror boiled for a moment, bursting out a strong light. A flying sword broke free from the sword formation, and hovered in mid-air for several weeks before staying there. In front of you.
{vpunch=10,0.5}三...三天？¤{vpunch=10,0.5} three...three days?
在剑阵的威压下坚持的越久，得到的好处也就越多，想必{shidi}这几天应该已经有所体会了。¤The longer you persist under the pressure of the sword formation, the more benefits you will get. Presumably {shidi} should have experienced it in the past few days.
有意思...这剑阵考验的不是你们的修为与心境，而是悟性。只有能够在剑势的威能之下领悟剑意，才能够获得阵中灵气剑的认可。¤Interesting... This sword formation tests not your cultivation level and state of mind, but your comprehension. Only by comprehending the sword intent under the power of the sword can you gain the approval of the aura sword in the formation.
{vpunch=10,0.5}六...六天？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Six...six days?
随着时间的流逝，剑阵中所蕴含的磅礴剑意也愈发凌厉起来，在强大的威压之下，你竟然进入了难得一遇的顿悟状态...¤With the passage of time, the majestic sword intent contained in the sword formation has become more and more fierce. Under the strong pressure, you have entered a rare epiphany state...
先去门派{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}领取入门功法，然后再回来找我吧。¤First go to the school {color=#d0380a} Tibetan Scripture Pavilion{/color} to receive the introductory exercises, and then come back to me.
除了你以外，广场上还有熙熙攘攘不下百人聚集在一起等待，想必都是来参加这仙资大会的。¤In addition to you, there are more than a hundred people on the square gathered together waiting, presumably all of them are here to participate in the Fairy Capital Conference.
{shidi}不必疑惑，你已经在养剑池前入定了整整{color=#d0380a}{$tian}{/color}天了，那些没有通过测试的人早在{$tian}天前就已经离开门派，下山去了。¤{shidi}No need to be confused, you've been meditating in front of the Sword Raising Pond for a whole {color=#d0380a}{$tian}{/color}day, those who didn't pass the test left the sect and went down the mountain long before {$tian}.
能够在大阵之中坚持下来，并得到灵剑认可之人，就有资格成为我派外门弟子。至于能否得到灵剑的认可，就看各位的{color=#d0380a}悟性{/color}了。¤Those who can persevere in the big formation and get the approval of the spirit sword are qualified to become disciples of my sent outer sect. As for whether they can get the approval of the spirit sword, it depends on your {color=#d0380a}savvy{/ color}.
还剩余三五人仍在坚持，直到天色渐暗之时，才全部结束。其中仅有一人得到了剑阵的认可，收服了剑阵中的一把灵剑，他也成为了今年仙资大会中唯一一个通过测试的人。¤There are still three or five people who are still insisting, until the sky is getting dark, all of them are over. Only one of them has been recognized by the sword formation, and he has conquered a spirit sword in the sword formation, and he has also become this year's fairy capital. The only person in the conference who passed the test.
你跟着那名弟子来到广场之上，首先映入你眼帘的是恢弘无比的剑阵。游动的飞剑错综汇集成巨大的剑河，将建筑群镀上一层浅薄的青色。¤You followed that disciple to the square, the first thing you saw was the magnificent sword formation. The swimming flying swords were intricately integrated into a huge river of swords, and the buildings were plated with a thin layer of cyan.
你从入定的状态中缓缓醒来，有些茫然地环顾广场的四周，发现白天熙熙攘攘来参加仙资大会的人群都已经不见了。¤You slowly wake up from your meditative state and look around the square in some bewilderment, noticing that all the crowds that bustled around during the day to attend the Immortal Capital Conference have disappeared.
你来到宗门广场，只见广场的中心已经升起了一座巨大的擂台。此刻，台下已是人山人海，负责这次门派大比报名事宜的几位执事周围更是被围的水泄不通。人群中有着许多身着蓝色道袍的女性修士，想来她们便是星河剑派的弟子们了。¤When you come to the Sect Square, a huge arena was set up in the center of the square. At this moment, there's people everywhere, and more people crowd around the deacons who are in charge of the registration, making it almost impossbile to get closer. You see many female cultivators in blue robes in the crowd. They must be disciples of the Galaxy Sword Sect.
今日是我们金虹剑派一年一度的仙资大会，无论年龄性别，但凡身具灵根者皆可以来养剑池前进行测试。¤Today is our Radiant Sword Sect's annual aptitude exam. Regardless of age or gender, anyone with spiritual roots can come to our sword nourishing pool for testing.
{shidi}不必疑惑，你已经在养剑池前入定了整整{color=#d0380a}三{/color}天了，那些没有通过测试的人早在三天前就已经离开门派，下山去了。¤{shidi}Don’t be confused, you have been in the sword pool for a full {color=#d0380a}three{/color} days. Those who have not passed the test have left the school as early as three days ago and went down the mountain. .
属于我的剑道...是什么呢？¤My Kendo...what is it?
眼前之人对你摇了摇头，你有些茫然地环顾四周，这才发现除你以外的大部分人都已经退出了入定的状态，垂头丧气的站在一边，想来也都和你一样，没有能够通过剑阵的考验。¤The person in front of you shook your head at you. You looked around in a daze. Only then did you find that most people except you had already withdrawn from the state of being in meditation. They stood dejectedly and stood aside. They wanted to be the same as you. Pass the test of the sword formation.
剑意...那是什么？¤Jianyi...what is that?
几位长老都已经在宗门大殿等你了，{shidi}请随我来。¤Several elders are already waiting for you in the clan hall, {shidi}please follow me.
毅力倒是可佳，可惜悟性不佳。¤Perseverance is good, but it's a pity that my understanding is not good.
{vpunch=10,0.5}{$tian}...{$tian}天？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}{$tian}... {$tian} days?
不过想像这般进入顿悟的状态，也只有第一次体悟剑阵时才有这样的机会。{shidi}能够入定四天，在外门弟子中已经算很不错的成绩，当年师兄我也只不过坚持了十天罢了。¤But imagine entering a state of enlightenment like this, and you only have this opportunity when you experience the sword formation for the first time. {shidi} is able to enter the Dharma for four days, and it is already a very good result among the outer disciples. It lasted ten days.
{shidi}不必疑惑，你已经在养剑池前入定了整整{color=#d0380a}四{/color}天了，那些没有通过测试的人早在四天前就已经离开门派，下山去了。¤{shidi}Don’t be confused, you have already entered the sword pool for a full {color=#d0380a}four{/color} days. Those who have not passed the test have left the school four days ago and went down the mountain. .
不过想像这般进入顿悟的状态，也只有第一次体悟剑阵时才有这样的机会。{shidi}能够入定五天，在外门弟子中已经算很不错的成绩，当年师兄我也只不过坚持了十天罢了。¤But imagine entering a state of enlightenment like this, and only the first time you experience the sword formation can you have such a chance. {shidi} is able to enter for five days, and it is already a very good result among the outer disciples. It lasted ten days.
不过想像这般进入顿悟的状态，也只有第一次体悟剑阵时才有这样的机会。{shidi}能够入定三天，在外门弟子中已经算很不错的成绩，当年师兄我也只不过坚持了十天罢了。¤But imagine entering a state of enlightenment like this, and only the first time you experience the sword formation can you have such a chance. {shidi} can enter the samādhi for three days, and it is already a very good result among the outer disciples. It lasted ten days.
{shidi}不必疑惑，你已经在养剑池前入定了整整{color=#d0380a}六{/color}天了，那些没有通过测试的人早在六天前就已经离开门派，下山去了。¤{shidi}Don’t be confused, you have already entered the sword pool for a full {color=#d0380a}six{/color} days. Those who have not passed the test have left the school as early as six days ago and went down the mountain. .
{shidi}不必疑惑，你已经在养剑池前入定了整整{color=#d0380a}五{/color}天了，那些没有通过测试的人早在五天前就已经离开门派，下山去了。¤{shidi}Don’t be confused, you have already entered the sword pool for a full {color=#d0380a}five{/color} days. Those who have not passed the test have already left the school five days ago and went down the mountain. .
但无论如何，只有领悟属于自己的剑道，才能成为一个真正的剑修。这金虹剑派的仙资测试，倒真是不同寻常。¤But in any case, only by comprehending one's own Sword Dao can you become a sword cultivator of any real worth. Radiant Sword Sect's test is really different compared to others.
一年一度的仙资大会现已结束，没有通过测试的诸位道友与本派无缘，就随着方执事一起下山去吧。¤The annual aptitude exam has now ended. Those who have not passed the test can't join us. Please follow Deacon Fang and go down the mountain.
可惜想像这般进入顿悟的状态，也只有第一次体悟剑阵时才有这样的机会。{shidi}能够入定{$tian}天，说明你悟性极高，实属百年难遇之奇才。¤Unfortunately, if you want to enter a state of epiphany like this, you will only have the opportunity to do so when you first comprehend the sword formation. {The fact that you were able to meditate for {$tian} days shows that you are extremely enlightened and are a rare talent that can only be found in a hundred years.
下面请各位道友来养剑池前坐下，将自身灵气注入剑池，体悟剑意。¤Next, I invite fellow daoists to sit down in front of the sword pond, pour their aura into the sword pond, and realize the sword intent.
你也不必灰心，大道三千，个人自有个人的机缘，既然你的机缘不在这金虹剑派，那也不必强求。¤You don't have to be discouraged. There are three thousand great ways. You have your own destiny. Since your fate does not lie in the Radiant Sword Sect, no need to force yourself.
{shixiong}可是刚历练结束？猎魔试炼不日开启，大师兄正在发放{color=#d0380a}天魔令{/color}给即将启程的弟子呢。¤{shixiong} is the end of the experience? The demon hunting trial will start soon, and the big brother is issuing {color=#d0380a} celestial demon order{/color} to the disciples who are about to set off.
唉，你这次猎魔试炼的表现实在拖我派的后腿，此后可千万勤加修炼，切莫再如此丢老夫的脸面。¤Hey, the manifestation of your demon hunting trial this time is holding me back. From now on, you can practice harder and harder, and don't lose the face of the old man again.
切记莫要在门派中人面前提起我，否则你我二人师徒缘分也就到此为止了。¤Remember not to mention me in front of the people in the sect, or else the fate of you and me as master and disciple will come to an end.
是，弟子省得了。¤Yes, the disciple saves.
很好，这本《雾相化身》你先拿回去领悟，有什么不懂之处可再来问我。¤This is a very good, this fog phase incarnation you first take back to understand, if there is anything do not understand come back to ask me.
你倒是个有心的，罢了，我俩没有这个师徒缘分也不必强求。¤You are a kind-hearted, just, we do not have this master and disciple fate also do not need to force.
你且拿上这本我平日的修炼心得，算是全了我的一番心意。¤You can take this book of my usual cultivation experience, as a token of my appreciation.
多谢前辈美意，不过在下已经拜师，若再得您的传承恐怕德行有失，影响道心。¤Thank you for your kindness, but I have already worshipped, if you get your heritage again I am afraid that virtue is lost, affecting the dao heart.
不错，不错。如此年纪便能在寒月潭领悟幻雾之法，真是资质可嘉。¤Not bad, not bad at all. To be able to grasp the Illusionary Mist Technique at such an age, truly remarkable talent.
本座乃是星河剑派长老，道号奕云。看在你为我派弟子的份上我愿赠你一份机缘，即是获得我的功法传承，不知你可愿意？¤I am an elder of the Star River Sword School, and my daoist name is Yiyun. Seeing that you are of my sect, and fate has meant for us to meet, I will offer you the opportunity to inherit my techniques. Are you willing?
你这{xiaozi}可是到过寒月潭了？¤{xiaozi} ,Have you been to the Cold Moon Pool?
你再睁开眼时，突然发现身边多了一位身着星河剑派道袍的女修。¤When you open your eyes again, you suddenly find an additional female practitioner dressed in the Daoist robe of the Star River Sword School by your side.
不错，没有辜负了本座的《培源静心曲》。¤Not bad, did not fail to live up to this seat's Peiyuan Meditation Song.
如鸣佩环的琴音叮咚作响，似是有意引导一般令你心境空明。一曲奏罢，你获益匪浅。¤The tinkling sound of the zither like a ring of sound, as if it is intentionally guided to make your mind empty and clear. After the song, you have benefited a lot.
你没有贸然上前，而是选择在这片琴声中盘膝而坐，阖目修练。¤You did not rashly go forward, but chose to sit cross-legged in the sound of this zither, closed eyes cultivation.
哪来的黄毛{xiaozi}打扰本座修炼？去去去，离本座清修的地方远些。¤Where is the yellow hair {xiaozi} disturbing my cultivation? Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
你朝着竹屋的方向走了几步，一股强大的禁制之力传来，令你无法再前进半分。¤You took a few steps in the direction of the bamboo house, a powerful forbidden force came, so you can no longer move forward half a point.
瀑布旁的池水边伫立着一栋竹屋，里面传来铮铮琴音。¤There is a bamboo house standing by the pool of water next to the waterfall, and the sound of a clanging zither is coming from inside.
星河剑派管辖的风雷谷内竟有人居住，不知是何方神圣？¤The Wind and Thunder Valley under the jurisdiction of the Star River Sword Sect is actually inhabited, I wonder what kind of divinity it is?
不知走了多久，你周围的迷雾渐渐散去，只见林石上一帘瀑布奔流而下，水花急溅，激起无数水柱。¤I do not know how long to walk, you around the fog gradually dispersed, only to see a curtain of waterfall on the forest rocks rushing down, splashing water, stirring up countless columns of water.
这雾起得蹊跷，我倒要看看是什么在这里装神弄鬼！¤This fog is strange, I would like to see what is here to play a ghost!
反正也找不到出去的路，你把心一横，径直朝雾中走去。¤Anyway, you can not find the way out, you put your heart, straight towards the fog.
也不知道此处什么门道，竟如此诡秘。¤I don't know what kind of doorway is here, it is so secretive.
你努力摸索着来路，功夫不负有心人，在你坚持不懈的寻找下你终于走出了这片迷雾。¤You try to figure out the way to come, work does not pay off, in your persistent search you finally out of this fog.
回头望去，来时的路同样被浓雾遮掩，你不由迷失了方向。¤Looking back, the way you came is also covered by the fog, you can not help but lose your way.
你刚踏入此地就感受到一股强大的禁制之力，无法再前进半分。¤You have just stepped into this place will feel a powerful forbidden force, can no longer move forward half a point.
你刚踏入此地便升腾起厚重的迷雾，仿佛行走在云端般缥缈虚幻。¤You have just stepped into this place will rise up a thick fog, as if walking in the clouds as indistinct and illusory.
我还是不要打扰奕云前辈清修了......¤I'd better not disturb Elder Yiyan's secluded meditation......
一片雾霭迷蒙之地，令你心生亲切之感。¤A misty and misty land, so that you feel a sense of affection.
依弟子之见，《雾相化身》可用于迷惑敌人，在对战时以幻雾制造假身，虚实之间令对方无法断定真假。¤In my opinion, the Mist Phase Incarnation can be used to confuse the enemy and create a false body with illusionary fog when fighting, so that the opponent cannot determine the truth between reality and falsity.
除此以外，你大可用此假身引诱对方攻击，白白消耗他的灵力。¤In addition, you can use this fake body to lure the opponent to attack and consume his spiritual power for nothing.
能领悟至此你已对《雾相化身》有了较深的见解。为师接下来便将《云雾剑法》传授与你。¤You have already gained a deeper insight into the Mist Phase Incarnation. I will then teach you the Cloud and Mist Sword Technique.
此神通较难体悟，望你勤加修炼，切莫辜负本座对你的期望。¤This divine ability is difficult to comprehend, I hope you cultivate it diligently, do not fail to live up to the expectations of this seat to you.
有些熟悉的琴音袅袅升起，你心中清楚这是奕云仙子在提点你，于是静下心来专一修炼。¤The familiar sound of zither begins, you know that this must be Lady Yiyun helping you, so you calm yourself and focus in cultivation.
孺子可教也，上次我交给你的《雾相化身》修练得怎么样了？¤Good, well done. How is the Mistborn Avatar Arts I taught you last time coming along?
距上次你来之期还未满一年，贪多嚼不烂，你且回去多体悟体悟再来见我。¤The last time you came to the period has not yet completed a year, greed can not be chewed, you and go back to understand more body comprehension before coming to see me.
再次来到奕云仙子的清修之地，你轻车熟路地穿过迷雾来到竹屋前。¤Once again, you come to the place where Lady Yiyun cultivates, and you easily pass through the mists to the bamboo house within.
言罢，奕云仙子挥了挥手，浓雾轻拢慢涌，将四周的景象全部遮掩起来。¤After speaking, Lady Yiyun waved her hand, and the fog gathered lightly and slowly, covering up all the surrounding scenery.
你四下搜寻了一番，再也不见当初的瀑布与竹屋，只得对着雾霭深处行了个大礼，拜别奕云仙子。¤You look around, but could no longer see the waterfall and bamboo house, so you bow deeply to the bellowing mist and bid farewell to Lady Yiyun.
你既得了我的传承，就要勤加修炼争取成为长老于门派授业，切莫让此流派没落。¤You have received my heritage, you must diligently cultivate to become an elder in the sect to teach, do not let this school fall.
您是指......？¤You mean ......?
也怪我当时年少轻狂过于自负，以为天赋资质便能决定仙途的一切，才落得如今这样无可挽回的局面。¤It is also my fault that I was too young and arrogant, thinking that my talent and qualifications would determine everything in the immortal path, which has led to this irreparable situation.
我与云玑本师出同门，皆拜于前任掌门席下。师姐天资愚钝，但胜在勤奋刻苦，故仙途还算平顺。¤Yun Ji and I are from the same school and both studied under the previous master. My sister is dull, but she is diligent and hardworking, so her immortal journey is quite smooth.
而我资质稍胜一筹，凭借不弱的修为也闯出了自己的一片天地，正是意气风发少年时。¤And I am slightly better qualified, with not weak cultivation also made their own piece of heaven and earth, it is the vigor of youth.
遥想当年几位各有所成的同门煮茶论道，卧栏听雨，倒也算风流惬意。只可惜师尊未能突破化神，大限将至之际星河剑派内因掌门之位的归属起了分歧。¤Thinking back to the days when several accomplished fellow disciples boiled tea and discussed the doctrine, lying on the fence listening to the rain, but also considered a leisurely and pleasant. It is a pity that the master failed to break through the Deity Transformation, when the end of the Celestial Sword Sect because of the ownership of the position of Sect leader has been divided.
师姐与我各有一派支持，但选举前夕不知长老们达成了什么共识，竟将票齐齐投给了师姐。¤Sister and I each have a faction support, but the election eve I do not know what the elders reached a consensus, but will vote for sister.
我那时心高气傲，无法忍受这样的结果，一气之下离开星河剑派于这风雷谷中开辟了一方居所。¤I was high-minded and arrogant, could not bear such a result, and left the Star River Sword School in anger to open a residence in this Wind Thunder Valley.
这些年细细想来，或许师尊心中已有定数。我生性浮躁，不如师姐谨慎稳重，星河剑派交予师姐手中也许才是最好的结果。¤These years, thinking about it, perhaps the master's heart has been determined. I am impetuous by nature, not as cautious and steady as sister, the Star River Sword School into the hands of sister may be the best result.
唉，也难怪你会好奇我为何于此地清修，毕竟有谁愿意放弃门派的地位声望来守一座平平无奇的后山呢？¤Alas, it is no wonder you are curious why I am here to cultivate, after all, who is willing to give up the status and prestige of the sect to guard a mediocre back mountain?
奕云仙子又与你说了许多她对此道的感悟，你感觉自己又有了新的理解。¤The fairy Yiyun told you a lot about her perception of this dao, and you feel you have a new understanding.
不知你对于《云雾剑法》的感悟如何，说与本座听听。¤I don't know how you feel about the Cloud and Mist Sword Technique, tell me to listen to it.
《云雾剑法》剑意为主，幻雾为辅。在自身对剑道理解的基础上以幻雾之法辅以攻击，达到锦上添花之效。¤The Cloud Mist Sword Technique is based on sword intent, supplemented by illusionary mist. In their own understanding of the sword dao based on the method of illusionary fog to supplement the attack, to achieve the effect of icing on the cake.
正是如此，能领悟至此你已对《云雾剑法》有了较深的见解。接下来为师传授与你的，是幻雾派一脉相传的《幻雾真法》。¤That's it, you have already gained a deeper insight into the Cloud and Mist Sword Technique. The next thing I will teach you is the Illusory Mist Technique, which has been passed down from one lineage of the Illusory Mist School.
此功法须得搭配你先前领悟的那些神通使用方能发挥最大效益，你要好好修练。¤This technique must be used with your previous understanding of those divine abilities to maximize the benefits, you should practice well.
待领悟《幻雾真法》，你所学的神通功法已自成体系，我能传授给你的也只有这么多了。¤To understand the Illusory Mist True Method, you have learned the divine power technique has formed its own system, I can only teach you so much.
你离开此地后我二人师徒缘分便尽了，今日我再最后替你答疑解惑一次吧。¤After you leave this place, our master and disciple fate will be over, today I will answer your questions and solve your problems one last time.
你对于《云雾剑法》的感悟还过于浅显，你且回去多体悟体悟再来见我。¤Your understanding of Cloud and Mist Swordsmanship is still too superficial, you should go back and see me again after you have more experience and understanding.
此地是星河剑派矿脉，要在此采集吗？¤This place is the Star River Sword School's mineral vein, to collect here?
要离开风雷谷吗？¤Do you want to leave Wind and Thunder Valley?
竟然能体悟到雾系神通...看来我也算是有缘之人。¤Surprisingly, I was able to comprehend the fog system divine ability... It seems that I am considered a person of destiny.
你抓出此刻的顿悟之意屈膝而坐，尝试领悟转换的法门。¤You catch the epiphany of the moment sit bent knee and try to comprehend the magic of transformation.
感受着水与雾的转换，你尝试着模拟其中奥妙。你手中的水弹旋转变换，从透澈逐渐转向素色，一团缥缈的雾气最终在你手中成型。¤Feeling the transformation of water and fog, you try to simulate the subtleties of it. The water bullet in your hand rotates and changes, gradually shifting from clear to plain, and a misty mist eventually takes shape in your hand.
你在这砭人肌骨的潭水中修炼了许久，感觉心神受益颇多。¤You have been practicing in this bone-chilling water for a long time and feel that your mind is benefiting a lot.
你心神一动，跨步迈入潭水中。刺骨的寒意侵蚀着你的灵气，你不由得运起功法护住经脉。¤Your mind moves and you step into the pool water. The bone-chilling coldness erodes your aura, and you can't help but protect your meridians with your kung fu.
你有些好奇地走上前去，用手鞠了一把潭水。清冽的潭水在你手中化为一团水雾倏尔飘散。¤You walk forward with some curiosity and use your hand to bow a handful of pool water. The fresh water turns into a mist in your hand and drifts away.
藉此机会你屈膝而坐，乘着顿悟之意畅游灵海。¤You take this opportunity to sit on your knees and swim in the sea of spirituality with the intention of epiphany.
你感悟着清月谭水带来的纯粹灵气，似乎从其中窥探到水之道的法门。¤You perceive the pure spiritual energy brought by the water of the clear moon, and seem to have glimpsed the dharma of the Way of Water from it.
正前方一汪清澈的潭水似倒映皎月之影般澄澈清亮，隐隐散出冷峭之气。¤A clear pool of water directly in front of you is as clear as the reflection of the moon, with a cold and craggy aura faintly emanating from it.
你踏入寒月潭所处之地。浓厚的水系灵气夹杂着寒气扑面而来，你不禁打了个寒颤。¤You step into the place where the Cold Moon Pool is located. You shiver as the thick water Qi mixed with cold air hits you.
此地只向持有清月令的弟子开放，{shidi}请回吧。¤This place is only open to disciples with the Clear Moon Order, {shidi} please go back.
来者何人？¤Who is the visitor?
你能感受到此地浓郁的龙脉之力似乎会被你吸引。¤You can feel the strong power of dragon veins here and it seems to be attracted to you.
你能感受到此地浓郁的龙脉之力经龙珠提纯之后源源不断的进入你的体内。¤You can feel the strong power of the dragon veins here, after being purified by the dragon balls, continuously enter your body.
若是你突破到筑基期，才能去第二层借阅更高级的功法玉简。至于第三层，则只对我派的长老和供奉们开放。¤If you break through to the foundation-building period, you can go to the second level to borrow more advanced jade slips. As for the third level, it is only open to our elders and guest elders.
{shidi}看着眼生，应该是第一次来我派藏经阁吧？¤{shidi} looked at him, it should be the first time I came to send the Buddhist scriptures pavilion, right?
我派藏经阁共分三层，这第一层存放的都是一些普通的功法、神通以及一些修真界的基础知识，是专门给低阶修士准备的，因为要普及众多的弟子，所以是不会用玉简存放的。¤Our Sect the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion to be divided into three levels. The first level stores some common exercises, magical powers, and some basic knowledge of the cultivation world. It is specially prepared for low-level cultivators, because many disciples need to be popularized. So it will not be stored in jade slips.
还请师兄指点。¤Brother please also give me some advice.
多谢师兄告知，请问这第一层的书籍可以随便借阅么？¤Thank you, brother, for telling me that. Can I borrow the books on the first floor?
你借阅的副本看完后，自行毁去便可。切记，无论你从藏经阁内拿的是天阶的神通玉简，还是最普通的人阶秘籍，都绝不可以外传！¤After reading the copy you borrowed, you can destroy it by yourself. Remember, whether you take the heavenly magic jade slips or the most common human-level cheats from the Tibetan scripture pavilion, you must never pass it away!
这些书都有很多的副本，但毕竟外门弟子众多，所以我们会收取一些灵石。你若是选好了自己想要的书籍，便可拿来我处登记。¤There are many copies of these books, but after all, there are many disciples in the outer sect, so we will charge some spirit stones. If you choose the books you want, you can bring them to our office to register.
是，师兄。¤Yes, brother.
此地是化尘教矿脉，要在此地采集吗？¤This place is a vein of the Dust Transformation Cult, to collect here?
我本来只是想看看这石碑什么门道，没想到竟了悟了土之道。¤I had just wanted to see what the doorway of this stone tablet was, but I didn't expect to realize the way of the earth.
想来是化尘教先人留下的机缘，但能于此顿悟也证明{xiaozi}你在修仙之路上确实有几分资质。¤I think it's the chance left by the ancestors of the Dust Transformation Cult, but being able to have an epiphany here also proves that {xiaozi} you do have some qualifications on the path of immortality cultivation.
望你勤加修炼，切莫白白浪费了自己的天赋。¤I hope you will be diligent in your training and not waste your talent.
你这{xiaozi}再多闭关几日，恐怕就要被化尘教之人扫地出门了。倒也算你走运，这几日并未有巡逻弟子到此地视察。¤You {xiaozi} a few more days of seclusion, I'm afraid you will be swept away by the people of the Dust Transformation Church. You are lucky that there are no patrolling disciples to inspect this place these days.
怕你出什么意外我便等候多时，现下{shixiong}出关并无大恙，我便继续巡逻去了。¤I was afraid that you had some kind of accident I waited for a long time, now {shixiong} came out of the gate and was not seriously ill, I will continue to patrol to go.
多谢师弟关照。¤Thank you for taking care of me.
{shixiong}总算醒了，我巡逻到无字碑这儿正见你盘坐于此，心想{shixiong}应是受先人留下的道意荫庇，领悟了土之道。¤I thought that {shixiong} should have been sheltered by the daoist intent left behind by his ancestors and had realized the earth path.
再次睁开双眼时，你对土之道的感悟似乎加深了一些。¤When you open your eyes again, your perception of the earth path seems to have deepened a bit.
你被这波动感染，沉浸于沙尘的世界中无法自拔。¤You are infected by the fluctuation and immersed in the world of sand and dust beyond your control.
石碑被扬起的沙砾包围着，你缓缓地朝它靠近。一丝淳厚的灵力迎面而来，天地间仿佛都充斥着沙的气息。¤The stone monument is surrounded by raised gravel, and you slowly move closer to it. A hint of pure spiritual energy greets you, and the world seems to be filled with the scent of sand.
高约百丈的断崖边伫立着一座厚重敦实的石碑，虽然其上未刻有任何文字，但你从中读到了时间的沧桑。¤There is a thick and solid stone monument standing by the cliff of about 100 feet high.
一块普通的无字石碑立在崖边，你凝神端详了一会儿，什么特别之处也没注意到。¤An ordinary wordless stone monument stands at the edge of the cliff, and you gaze at it for a while, not noticing anything special.
哼，说不准这就是这世上最后一株大衍草了，哪来那么造化之物多给你强筋锻骨。¤You can't say that this is the last of the Great Diffusion Grass in this world, where is the creation of so many things for you to strengthen your muscles and bones.
你仔细地检查了自己的变化，发现经由乾坤土药液浸泡后，你的身体强度提升了不少，远胜于同阶修士。¤You carefully examined the changes in yourself and found that after soaking in the Qiankun earth medicinal liquid, your body strength has increased a lot, far better than the same class of cultivators.
感觉筋骨活络了许多，要是能再寻来几盒泡泡岂不美哉？¤It feels like the tendons are much more alive, wouldn't it be beautiful if you could find a few more boxes of bubbles?
{xiaozi}，效果如何？¤{xiaozi}, how is the effect?
待你将池中药力吸收殆尽已是三日后，上岸后你简单地用灵力烘干了衣服。¤The actual fact that you will be absorbing all the medicinal power in the pool is three days later, you simply dried your clothes with spiritual power after you came ashore.
加入乾坤土的水依旧清澈，但却变得凝滞起来，你以灵力对抗这滞塞的池水朝着更深处走去。¤The water that was added to the Qiankun earth was still clear, but it became stagnant, and you used your spiritual energy to fight the stagnant pool of water to go deeper.
你准备好一切后布下敛息阵法，按照魏无极的吩咐运气护体，慢慢跨入池水中。¤After you have prepared everything and set up a breath-holding formation, follow Wei Wuji's instructions to protect your body with luck and slowly step into the pool water.
入浴时切记以灵力护体，待完全浸入水中后再将灵力散去方可发挥药汤作用。¤Remember to protect your body with your spiritual power when you enter the bath, and then dissipate your spiritual power after you are completely immersed in the water in order to bring the medicinal soup into play.
我知道了。¤I know.
它本身并无多大功效，珍贵的是它所扎根的土壤。大衍草生长的土地名为乾坤土，以其入浴沐身有固本培元之效。¤It is not very effective in itself, what is precious is the soil in which it is rooted. The land in which the Great Diffusion Grass grows is called Qiankun Earth, and its bathing in the body has the effect of consolidating and nurturing.
你且拿个玉盒出来，用玉片将此草连带周围三寸的泥土一并盛进盒内。不过就算使用玉盒保存，乾坤土的效力也会随时间流逝而衰减，最好是能立刻使用。¤You should take out a jade box and use the jade piece to put this grass into the box along with the three inches of soil around it. But even if you use the jade box to preserve it, the effectiveness of the Qiankun soil will also decay with the passage of time, it is best to use it immediately.
不远处有个小池塘，不知可行与否？¤There is a small pond not far away, I do not know if it is feasible or not?
{xiaozi}！去你左手边那个草丛看看！快！¤{xiaozi}! Go to the bush on your left hand side! Hurry!
魏无极略显焦急的声音敦促着你，你以为此处埋伏着什么不得了的敌人提心吊胆地摸了过去。¤The slightly anxious voice of Wei Wuji urges you to think that there is some great enemy in ambush here, and you cautiously feel your way over.
你谨慎地打探了一番后什么也没有发现，魏无极叫你查看的似乎只是一丛普通的草。¤You cautiously poked around and found nothing, Wei Wuji told you to check what seems to be just an ordinary bush.
老头儿，你是不是成心拿我开心？¤Old man, are you deliberately taking me for fun?
哈哈哈哈，这次你这{xiaozi}可是捡到宝了。我的眼光果然不错，其中叶缘似微波，五脉蕴地灵的那株正是大衍草无疑。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you are looking for. I really have a good eye, which leaf edge like microwave, five veins contain the earth spirit of the strain is exactly the great diffusion grass undoubtedly.
大衍草？¤The great diffusion grass?
没错，此草在我尚有形体时便近乎绝迹，知之者甚少。我原以为这大衍草如今已经灭绝了，没想到在这草丛还能找到一株。¤Yes, this grass is nearly extinct when I still have a form, few people know about it. I thought this Great Diffraction Grass was now extinct, but I never thought I would find one in this bush.
不错，当真是天道眷顾。既然如此将此土挖出后你便用灵力震碎三片草叶撒入池塘，再将乾坤土全部放入。¤That's right, it's really a blessing from heaven. In that case, after digging out this soil, you can use your spiritual power to shatter three grass leaves and scatter them into the pond, then put all the Qiankun soil into it.
正阳山处宁州西端，植被稀少环境恶劣，沙峰众多。你在其中跋涉多时，正值精疲力尽之际忽然走入一片水草丰茂的绿洲。¤Mt. Rising Sun is located in the western end of Ning Province, where the vegetation is sparse and the environment is harsh, and there are many sandy peaks. You have been trekking in it for a long time, and when you are exhausted, you suddenly walk into a lush oasis of water and grass.
要离开正阳山吗？¤Do you want to leave Mt. Rising Sun?
既然暴露了，拿命来！！¤Oh, not pretending anymore?
古神教的，你是束手就擒还是要吃点苦头啊？¤The Ancient God Cult's, are you going to give up your hand or are you going to suffer a little bit, huh?
{xiaozi}，这是我教自己的事，再不滚蛋我要叫人了啊！！¤{xiaozi}, it's my own business to teach, if you don't get lost I'm going to call someone ah!
对方瞳孔一缩。¤The other side's pupils shrink.
原来是化尘教的高徒，在下{FirstName}{LastName}，受白帝楼之托，前来看看贵教为何封山。¤The first name is {FirstName}{LastName}, and I was asked by the White Emperor's House to come and see why your religion has closed the mountain.
既然来此，那就进去看看吧，就我感知里面已经没有活人了。¤Since we are here, let's go in and take a look, as far as I perceive there are no more living people inside.
突然传送阵亮起。¤Suddenly the teleportation array lit up.
{xiaozi}，你自己小心点，这化尘教自封山门，八成与这古神教有关。¤The {xiaozi}, you be careful, this dusty religion since the sealing of the mountain door, 80% and this ancient God sect related.
{xiaozi}，这正阳山是我化尘教地界，还不快滚？!¤{xiaozi}, this Mt. Rising Sun is the territory of our Aeonic Sands Temple, now get lost!
护法，你们回...嗯？小子，你是谁？¤The guardian, you go back... Hmm? Kid, who are you?
突然传送阵亮起，里面出来一个身穿化尘教服饰的修士¤Suddenly the teleportation array lit up and a cultivator in the costume of the Dust Transformation Cult came out from inside
你在魏无极的指挥下，修复了这个阵法。¤You repaired this formation under Wei Wuji's command.
依我所说行事¤Act according to my words
唉，你个臭{xiaozi}，这不过是最简单的传送阵，怎么连这点阵道修为都没有？¤Ugh, you stinky {xiaozi}, this is just the simplest teleportation formation, how come you don't even have this bit of formation cultivation?
老头？在吗?这个石碑¤Old man? In? This stone tablet
...你感觉到眼前的的石碑，或有玄妙，但是也不抓不住重点。¤... You feel the monolith in front of you, or a mystery, but also do not catch the point.
看我修复它。¤Watch me fix it.
但以你对阵道的领悟，你能够分辨出这原是一个小型的传送阵，终点应该还是在正阳山之内。¤But with your comprehension of the Dao of Formation, you are able to discern that this was originally a small teleportation formation, and the end point should still be within the Mt. Rising Sun.
眼前是数块平平无奇的石碑，但有人为破坏的痕迹。¤In front of you are several mediocre stone monuments, but with traces of human destruction.
（和那李天如出一辙，只是此人修为实在不堪，掩饰魔气都做不到，这一次任务还挺顺利。）¤(And that Li Tian as the same, only this person cultivation is really unbearable, to conceal the demonic energy can not do, this time the mission is quite smooth.)
{xiaozi}，感觉到了吗？¤{xiaozi}, can you feel it?
{xiaozi}，小心点这家伙体内气息不似正道。¤The {xiaozi}, be careful this guy's body breath is not like the right way.
突然传送阵亮起，走出一个身穿化尘教服饰的修士。¤Suddenly the teleportation array lit up and out walked a cultivator dressed in the robes of the Dust Transformation sect.
护法，你们回...嗯？{xiaozi}，你是谁？这正阳山是我化尘教地界，还不快滚!¤Guardian, you guys go back to... Hmm? {xiaozi}, who are you? This Mt. Rising Sun is my territory of the Dust Transformation Cult, so get lost!
谨慎地将他的尸身转移到空地上后，你发现他原先所坐的地方露出了小巧的机关。¤After cautiously transferring his corpse to the clearing, you find the compact mechanism revealed where he was originally sitting.
你再一次把目光转向了沙台，这一次你打算将无名修士从台上移下仔细调查一下。¤Once again you turn your attention to the sand platform, this time intending to move the nameless cultivator off the platform to investigate it more closely.
平淡无奇的矿灯，是修士们常用的照明设备，没什么特别之处。¤The bland mining lamp, a common lighting device for cultivators, is nothing special.
正阳山处正是宁州与衡州相接处，自然多些歪门心思闯入宁州的不轨之徒。¤Mt. Rising Sun is where Ning Province and Heng Province meet, naturally more crooked mind to break into Ning Province miscreants.
我看此人道袍款式似是化尘教中人...许是哪位长老不幸殒命吧。¤I see this person's robe style seems to be a person of the Dust Transformation Cult... Maybe it was one of the elders who died unfortunately.
罢了，这沙坑里也没剩下什么珍贵的东西，你{xiaozi}还是找找怎么出去吧。¤It's just that there's nothing precious left in this sand pit, so you {xiaozi} should find out how to get out.
但此地也没什么特别值得注意的地方，只有矿灯和沙台是这修士布置的，不知其中是否有什么奥妙。¤But this place is not particularly noteworthy, only the mine lamp and sand platform is this cultivator arranged, I do not know whether there is any mystery.
说来也怪，这附近好像魔修人数众多，先前化尘教封锁门派似乎也是为了除魔卫道。¤Strange to say, this neighborhood seems to have a large number of evil cultivators, previously the Dust Transformation Church blockade sect seems to be to get rid of the demons and defend the way.
你无视了魏无极的插科打诨，抱着侥幸的态度将储物袋内的东西一一掏出，却发现除了拓着此人修炼心得的玉简外竟没有一件完好的物品。¤You ignore Wei Wuji's gag, holding a fluke attitude to pull out the contents of the storage bag one by one, only to find that in addition to the top of the person's cultivation tips jade slip is not a single intact items.
别说，你这运气真是差到家了。¤Don't say, your luck is really bad to home.
或许是因为敌手神通的关系，储物袋也受到了一定程度的损伤，里面不少宝物都毁于一旦。¤Perhaps because of the adversary's magical power, the storage bag also suffered a certain degree of damage, many of the treasures inside were destroyed.
你心怀敬畏地探查着修士的尸体，从他紧攥的手中发现了一个储物袋。¤You probe the cultivator's corpse with awe and find a storage pouch from his clenched hand.
看来此人生前曾与魔修殊死搏斗，因伤势过重藏匿在这沙坑中，没想到回天乏力最终还是陨落于此。¤It seems that this person had fought to the death with the evil cultivator in life, and hid in this sand pit because of his injuries, not expecting to return to heaven and eventually fall here.
厚实的沙台上刻下了几行文字，但经过时间磨砺能看清的文字少之又少，你靠着只言片语努力地读取着其中的讯息。¤The thick sand table carved a few lines of text, but after time to sharpen the few words can be read, you rely on only a few words to try to read the message.
他的道袍上布满伤痕，或许损毁之前是件不错的防御法器，但现在看来明显变成了一堆破布。¤His daoist robe is covered with scars, perhaps before the damage was a good defensive magic weapon, but now it seems clearly turned into a pile of rags.
老头儿，你刚刚说运气好不会就是指这个吧？¤Old man, you just said good luck is not referring to this, right?
死人而已，有什么好怕的。我看这修士生前修为应当不差，至少是金丹中期。人死如灯灭，他可带不走身上的功法丹药法器，你且搜罗一下看看此人身上怀揣何物。¤Dead people are just, what is there to be afraid of. I think this cultivator should not be bad in life, at least the middle Jindan. People die like a lamp, he can not take away the body of the techniques, pills and magic weapons, and you search to see what this person is carrying.
听了魏无极的话，你也开始好奇这位修士留下的遗物。对着干尸行礼后，你开始小心地翻看他的行装。¤After listening to Wei Wuji, you also began to be curious about the relics left behind by this cultivator. After saluting the dry corpse, you begin to carefully look through his clothes.
这……¤This……
为验证你的猜测，你小心翼翼地凑上前去。果不其然，这名修士已经仙去，尸体在大漠独特的环境下变得干燥僵硬。¤To verify your suspicions, you cautiously come forward. As expected, the cultivator has already passed away immortally, and the corpse has become dry and stiff in the unique environment of the desert.
若不是龟息术...这名修士莫非...？¤If not for the Turtle Breath Technique... Could this cultivator have been...?
你仔细地观察着那道人影，发现他竟连呼吸的起伏都没有。¤You look carefully at the figure and find that he doesn't even have the rise and fall of breathing.
一具失去水分的干尸直勾勾地注视着你，让你不禁冷汗直流。¤A dry corpse that has lost its moisture stares straight at you, causing you to sweat coldly.
你把心一横，凑上前去。原来那修士并非不愿回应，而是无法回应！¤You put your heart on the line and move forward. It turns out the cultivator wasn't unwilling to respond, but unable to!
你叹了口气，开始认真地审视四周。本应漆黑的沙坑却在角落里人为安置了照明用的矿石，你借着微弱的光亮看到不远处似乎有人盘坐于台上。¤You sigh and begin to look around in earnest. The sandpit should be dark, but in the corner there is artificially placed ore for lighting, and you see by the faint light that there seems to be someone sitting on a platform not far away.
在下{FirstName}{LastName}，因意外不慎落入此地，不知道友可否行个方便告知在下出去的方法？¤I {FirstName}{LastName}, accidentally fell into this place, I wonder if you can tell me how to get out?
那人影一动不动，不知是未听清你的话还是故意为之。¤The figure did not move, I do not know if it did not hear you or did it on purpose.
真是天道眷顾，你这{xiaozi}这回走运了。¤The world is really lucky, you {xiaozi} are lucky this time.
除了还活着，掉进这地方有什么运气可谈？¤Apart from being alive, what luck is there to talk about when you fall into this place?
哼，朽木不可雕，你自己看看周围吧。¤Humph, rotten wood cannot be carved, take a look around yourself.
魏无极说完便回到了剑里，任凭你怎么呼唤也不应答。¤Wei Wuji finished speaking and returned to the sword, no matter how you call, but did not answer.
不好，{xiaozi}快跑，这是魔修的气息！¤Not good, {xiaozi} run, this is the breath of the evil cultivator!
为避免打草惊蛇，你装出一副不知情的样子向另一个方向走去，没想到脚下一个不稳，栽进了一旁的沙坑中。¤In order to avoid alarming the snake, you pretend to be unaware of the look in the other direction, did not expect a foot unstable, planted into a side of the sand pit.
奇怪，腿怎么抽不出来？¤Strange, why can't you pull your legs out?
遁术丝毫没有起到作用，你随着挣扎愈陷愈深。原本平整的沙子逐渐塌陷成流动的旋涡，将你拉向更深处。¤The evasion technique did not work at all, you sink deeper and deeper as you struggle. The originally flat sand gradually collapsed into a flowing vortex, pulling you deeper and deeper.
{xiaozi}，快醒醒。¤You've got to wake up.
在魏无极急切的呼唤下，你睁开双眼。原来刚才的流沙下自成一方天地，你因此幸免于难。¤In Wei Wuji's eager call, you opened your eyes. It turns out that the world under the quicksand just now formed a world of its own, and you were thus spared.
“......这老头脾气还挺大。”¤...... This old man has quite a temper.
你刚刚踏入此地，就感受到一股强烈的不适感。周围的灵气不知为何散发出令人生厌的气息，你尝试着呼唤魏无极。¤You have just stepped into this place and felt a strong sense of discomfort. The aura around you somehow gives off a disgusting aura, and you try to call out to Wei Wuji.
一条粗如成年男子大臂的蛇冲了出来，挡住了你们的去路。¤A snake as thick as a grown man's arm rushes out and blocks your way.
怎么又遇见妖兽了！¤How come we met a Spirit Beast again!
这股药香...是穿心莲！！¤This herbal fragrance... It's the Pureheart Lotus!
这在三品仙草中也算得上是极为稀有的...没想到能在这里找到。¤This is also considered extremely rare in the third grade immortal herbs... I didn't expect to find it here.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，这几株穿心莲我找了很久，若是你愿意全部让给我，我可以用一枚“清蕴丹”和你交换。¤I've been looking for this Pureheart Lotus for a long time, if you are willing to let me have it, I can exchange a Panacea Pill for it.
你意下如何？¤What do you think?
那就多谢{FirstName}{xiongdi}了！¤I'd like to thank {FirstName}{xiongdi} for that!
没想到{FirstName}{xiongdi}也对炼丹有兴趣...¤I didn't think {FirstName}{xiongdi} would be interested in alchemy...
也罢，那咱两就按之前说好的，一人一半分了吧。¤So, let's split it half and half as we agreed before.
和来时粗糙的石壁不同，这条岔路铺满了青色的石砖，似乎曾有人居住。¤Unlike the rough stone walls on the way in, this fork in the road is paved with greenish stone bricks that appear to have been inhabited.
你们借着照明法器微弱的光缓缓前行，终于来到道路尽头。¤You move slowly by the faint light of the illuminating spell and finally come to the end of the road.
洞府？！这里的妖兽难不成有人操纵？¤A cave? Is it hard to manipulate the Spirit Beasts here?
支持壁灯的能源还没用尽，摇曳的灵力火焰照亮了整个石室。青白的地砖光亮如新，但周围的石台却落满灰尘。¤The energy supporting the wall lamp has not yet run out, and the wavering spiritual flame illuminates the entire stone room. The green and white floor tiles are shiny as new, but the surrounding stone platforms are covered in dust.
你们看着眼前略有怪异的景象提高了警惕，小心地探索着石室。¤You looked at the slightly strange sight in front of you and raised your guard, exploring the stone room carefully.
哎！{FirstName}{xiongdi}快来！¤Oi! {FirstName}{xiongdi}Come on!
你们两个一同破坏了禁制，将里面存放的东西一股脑拿了出来。¤Together, the two of you broke the forbidden system and took out the things stored inside in one go.
一个{color=#d0380a}通体漆黑的药瓶{/color}吸引了倪旭欣的全部注意，他打开瓶塞闻了闻，便转过头直勾勾地盯着你，看得你毛骨悚然。¤A {color=#d0380a}blackened medicine bottle {/color} attracted Ni XuXin's full attention, he opened the cork and smelled it, then turned his head and stared straight at you, looking at you creepily.
倪兄，你没事吧...？¤Brother Ni, are you okay...?
{xiongdi}见谅，实不相瞒...，我有个小小的癖好。¤{xiongdi}Pardon me, truth be told... I have a little fetish.
什么癖好？杀人夺宝？我要不还是离他远一点吧......¤What fetish? Killing people for treasure? I'd better stay away from him ......
你不动声色地往后退了一步...¤You did not move a step back...
我话还没说完，{xiongdi}你把我想成什么人了！¤I haven't finished my sentence, {xiongdi} what do you take me for!
是收集丹药的癖好！¤It's the fetish of collecting Pills!
就是收集不同的丹药......¤It's collecting different Pills ......
各种丹药我都喜欢在身上备一些，以防不时之需。¤All kinds of Pills I like to have some on my person in case I need them.
我还从来没见到过这个类型的丹药，{xiongdi}若愿意把它让给我，剩下的东西你可以全都拿走！¤I have never seen this type of Pill, {xiongdi} if you are willing to let it to me, you can take all the rest!
你把手一挥，示意倪旭欣你并不在意此事。¤You waved your hand, signaling Ni XuXin that you did not care about this matter.
正当你们想要四处转转，看看还有什么没有发现的机关禁制之时，只听魏无极突然传音道...¤Just when you want to look around to see what other organs and prohibitions you have not found, only to hear Wei Wuji suddenly transmitted voice...
不好，快退！¤Not good, retreat!
说时迟那时快，一人高的尾稍如同横扫而来的铁壁，重重将倪旭欣击飞开来。¤When it's too late, the one-person tall tail is like a sweeping iron wall, heavily knocking Ni XuXin away.
这妖兽的气息...恐怕已有筑基巅峰修为。¤This Spirit Beast's breath... I'm afraid that the peak cultivation of Foundation Establishment.
你听了魏无极的话，焦急地回头看向倪旭欣。只见他虽然胸口血肉模糊，竟然还能勉强站立，也不\r知是用了什么神通。¤You listened to Wei Wuji, anxiously looked back at Ni XuXin. Only to see that although his chest is bloody and fleshy, he can still barely stand, and not \r know what divine ability is used.
{xiongdi}，咳……对不住了，再帮我争取{color=#d0380a}三{/color}招的时间……咳咳……我有办法带你离开这里。¤{xiongdi}, cough ...... sorry, help me get {color=#d0380a} three more {/color} strokes of time ...... cough ...... I have a way to take you out of here.
这边好像是洞府主人留下的资源！¤This side seems to be a resource left by the cave master!
费了咱们老大的劲才找到这里，我倒要看看这储物法阵里放了什么宝贝。¤Took us a lot of effort to find this place, I'd like to see what treasures were put in this storage spell.
{xiaozi}，你刚刚拿到的丹药似乎有临战提升防御的功效。把{color=#d0380a}丹药服下{/color}，只是支撑三个回合的话，应该还是做得到的！¤{xiaozi}, the medicine pill you just got seems to have the effect of improving defense in battle. Taking the {color=#d0380a} pill{/color}, if you only last three rounds, you should be able to do it!
多谢师姐。¤Thank you, Senior Sister.
不错，此潭天然成于谷内深处，迄今约有万年历史。其中玄妙待你前往清月谭一观便知，不过能够领悟多少还是看你个人的机遇。¤Yes, this pond is naturally formed in the depths of the valley and has a history of about 10,000 years. The mystery will be known when you go to Qingyuetan, but how much you can understand depends on your personal opportunities.
清月谭？¤Qingyue Tan?
此乃清月令，我派执掌的后山中有一清月谭，持有此令方可前往潭中。¤This is the Qingyue Order. There is a Qingyue Tan in the back mountain that I am in charge of. You can only go to Tanzhong if you hold this order.
你既已成内门弟子，分内的奖励我现在便交给你。¤Since you have become an inner disciple, I will give you the rewards for your part now.
你走到凝霜仙子身前，行拜师之礼。¤You walk up to Fairy Ningshuang and do the ceremony of apprenticeship.
咳咳，从今天开始你就是我的徒弟了，在你{color=#d0380a}结丹之前{/color}，可要好好的听为师的话。¤Ahem, you will be my apprentice from today onwards. Before you {color=#d0380a}contain the Pill{/color}, you must listen carefully to what your teacher says.
此剑唤作星河，是我筑基时所炼制的武器，如今已经用不上，就送给你了~¤This sword is called Xinghe. It is a weapon that I made when I built the foundation. It is no longer useful now, so I will give it to you~
只见她笑着向你点了点头。¤She smiled and nodded to you.
此剑，名为初寒，乃为师年轻时所炼制，用起来颇为顺手。今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This sword, called Chu Han, was made by the teacher when he was young, and it was quite easy to use. It's a gift for you today.
此匣，名为漪涟，乃是我年轻时所炼制的武器，今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This box, called Yi Lian, is a weapon I made when I was young, and I will give it to you today as a gift.
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一把剑，递给了你。¤After all, the master took out a sword from the storage bag and handed it to you.
说罢，师父从储物袋中拿出一个匣子，递给了你。¤After all, Master took out a box from the storage bag and handed it to you.
你走到润熹仙子身前，行拜师之礼。¤You walk in front of Fairy Runxi and do the ceremony of apprenticeship.
嗯…希望你成为一个出色的人！¤Hmm...hope you're a great person!
她略带微笑地看了另外两位长老一眼。那两位长老也是相视一笑，对此毫不在意。¤She glanced at the other two elders with a slight smile. The two elders also smiled at each other and didn't care about it.
不错颖儿，辛苦你了。¤That's right Yinger, thank you for your hard work.
按大比的规矩，你可以从自行选择拜入在座的任意一名长老门下继续修行。颖儿，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤According to the rules of Taibi, you can choose to join and cultivate under any elder who sit here. Yinger, you can introduce the situation of the elders to you {shidi}.
颖儿，你将诸位长老的情况向你师妹介绍一下吧。¤Ying'er, please introduce the situation of the elders to your junior and sisters.
凝霜仙子为{color=#d0380a}冰{/color}派长老，主修《冰魄经》的她操控冰的能力宁州无人能出其右。¤Fairy Ningshuang is an elder of the {color=#d0380a}Bing{/color} faction. She majored in The Classic of Frozen Soul and her ability to control ice is unmatched in Ning Province.
师尊管辖{color=#d0380a}剑派{/color}，是掌门的亲传弟子。年纪轻轻就已经到达了元婴期。她独创的《乾坤化剑诀》也成为了我派秘传功法。¤Master governs the {color=#d0380a}Sword Sect{/color}, and is the direct disciple of the head. At a young age, he has already reached the Nascent Soul stage. Her original Qiankun Huajian Jue has also become a secret practice method of my school.
润熹仙子主修的《水灵妙法》能活用{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}之力，一经施展便是连绵不断的攻势，极难防备。¤Fairy Runxi's Water Spiritual Law can make full use of the power of {color=#d0380a}the five elements{/color}.
你走到玄伶仙子身前，行拜师之礼。¤You walk in front of Fairy Xuanling and do the ceremony of apprenticeship.
做我的亲传弟子可比做那些劳什子长老的亲传弟子有意思多了，你可愿入我门下？¤Being my personal disciple is much more interesting than being the personal disciple of the Elder Rao Shizi. Would you like to join me?
话音未落一道剑气破空而过，将那些莲花击成碎屑。¤Before the words fell, a Sword Qi broke through the air, smashing those lotus flowers into debris.
你侧目一看，玄伶仙子指尖凝气，一寸蓝芒似剑刃般聚于指上。¤Glancing sideways, you noticed that Sword Qi has condensed around Lady Starsong's fingertips. Then an inch of blue light gathers around her fingers like a sword blade.
雕虫小技，不过尔尔罢了。若是想先一步踏入仙途，自然应当入剑派修行。¤It's just an insignificant skill. If you want to step into the immortal path first, you should naturally enter the sword school to cultivate.
两位师妹，依我看不如让这位小友自己选择拜入哪派，你们看如何？¤Sisters, I think it would be better to let this little friend choose which school to join, what do you think?
此等资质连本座也有些心动，可惜本座如今修为已达元婴期瓶颈，要专心为之后的天劫做准备。¤Even I am excited in taking a disciple with such qualifications. But unfortunately, I am at the peak of Nascent Soul Stage; and I must now concentrate on preparing for the subsequent heavenly tribulation.
禀掌门师尊，今年的招收的外门弟子中，收取到了一名资质鉴定为天灵根的弟子。¤Sect Leader, among the outer disciples recruited this year, we have received a disciple whose qualification is identified as Heavenly Spiritual Root.
的确是纯净的天灵根，没有一丝一毫杂灵根，这点我看的清清楚楚。¤It is indeed a pure heavenly spiritual root, without a trace of mixed spiritual roots. I can see this clearly.
此等资质自是要拜入冰派修习御冰之术。¤The person with this kind of aptitude should join the ice sect and practice the ice controlling techniques.
凝霜仙子轻轻一挥，几朵剔透的冰莲出现在你的周围。¤Lady Frostglaze gave a light wave, and several clear ice lotus appeared around you.
这位师妹看来已经通过入门测试了，你先去神兵阁领取符器与门派装束，再回来找我。¤This junior sister seems to have passed the initiation test, so go to the Divine Armament Pavilion to collect your talisman weapons and sect attire, then come back to me.
接下来我将为你们开启剑阵，能否成为我派弟子全看你们个人的实力与机缘了。¤Next I will open the sword formation for you. Whether you can become my disciple depends on your personal strength and opportunity.
看样子想和大师姐说上话要先排队才行了，不如乘机问一下前面的同门在此等候的目的。¤It seems that if you want to talk to the master sister, you have to line up first. It's better to take the opportunity to ask the person in front of you for the purpose of waiting here.
我派择选弟子历来有两条要求，一是必须为女性。¤I have always had two requirements for selecting disciples. One is that they must be women.
不久，接引弟子将着你们这些未能通过初筛的人送回了山下。¤Soon, the receptionist disciples will send those of you who failed the preliminary test back to the foot of the mountain.
三十日之期已过，原本热闹的宗门广场此时冷清了不少。大多数人都未通过星河剑阵的检测，被门派执事送回了山下。¤The 30-day period has passed, and the bustling Sect Square is now deserted a lot. Most of the people have not passed the inspection of the Galaxy Sword Array and were sent back to the mountain by the deacon.
你对水之道的感悟略微提升了。¤Your perception of the way of water has slightly improved.
切记，你们只有三十日时间。逾期未通过测试者，无论资质如何我派也不会通融。¤Remember, you only have 30 days. Those who fail the test after the expiration date will not be accommodating regardless of their qualifications.
她递给你一块玉白色令牌，触手温润厚实，上面似有若无的灵力波动给人一种中正宁和之感。¤She handed you a jade-white token, with warm and thick tentacles, and the seemingly non-existent spiritual fluctuations on it gave people a sense of peace and harmony.
你决定¤You decide
稍后会有长老带队引领诸位前往天魔眼，{shidi}若无要事可一同出发。¤Later, the elders will lead you to the Eye of the Demon, {shidi} can set off together if you have nothing to do.
很好，相信留下来的人都对自己的实力很有信心。我是慕容颖，星河剑派的首席弟子。¤Very good, I believe those who stayed are confident in their own strength. I am Murong Ying, the chief disciple of the Galaxy Sword Sect.
宗门大殿前一道蓝光冲天而起，慕容颖所站立的高台完全被剑光笼罩。¤A blue light blasted into the sky in front of the Zongmen Hall, and the high platform on which Murongying was standing was completely Shielded in sword light.
你来到宗门广场，只见广场前殿已经布好了一座巨大的阵法。此刻，阵法周围已是人山人海，大师姐慕容颖立于阵法中心似是有事情宣布。¤When you come to Zongmen Square, there is a huge formation in the front hall of the square. At this moment, there is a sea of ​​people around the formation, and the master sister Murongying standing at the center of the formation seems to have something to announce.
我再核实最后一遍，人群中可还有五灵根修士？¤I will check again for the last time, there are still five spirit root cultivators in the crowd?
恭喜诸位通过测试的师妹，接下来本门执事会告知你们入门相关的事宜。¤Congratulations to all of you who passed the test. Next, the deacon will inform you about the entry-related matters.
步入星河剑派的宗门广场，绵柔的水系灵气似有若无地萦绕着你。葱茏丰茂的草木映衬着萝兰色建筑群，典雅又别致，使人眼前一亮。¤Step into the Zongmen Square of the Galaxy Sword Sect, the soft water system aura seems to haunt you. The lush vegetation is set against the Luolan color buildings, elegant and unique, making people's eyes bright.
本届宗门大比即将开始，有意参加比赛的师妹将与我通过这座传送阵到达金虹剑派。如有此意请做好准备来到殿前阵法处，一炷香后我便会启动阵法。¤This Zongmen Grand Competition is about to begin, and the junior sisters who are interested in participating in the competition will reach the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect through this teleportation formation. If you want to, please be prepared to come to the temple formation. After a stick of incense, I will The formation will be activated.
不消多时，一位身着华丽服饰的冷面女子登上大殿前高台，看样子便是她来主持本次入门测试。¤It won't be long before a cold-faced woman dressed in gorgeous costumes stepped onto the high platform in front of the hall, and it seemed that she was here to preside over this introductory test.
若有人谎报灵根参与测试，在剑阵中遭遇什么不测我派概不负责。¤If someone lied about Linggen's participation in the test, I will not be responsible for any accidents encountered in the sword formation.
你跟随接引弟子踏上一旁的灵台，缓缓自山谷升上山巅。随着渺渺仙雾逐渐散去，瑰丽庄严的宗门建筑逐渐映入你的眼帘。¤You follow the disciples on the side of the spiritual platform, and slowly rise from the valley to the top of the mountain. As the mist gradually dissipates, the magnificent and solemn sect architecture gradually comes into your eyes.
广场上一阵骚动，过了片刻，一些人陆续离开星河剑派，看来应当是未达到要求。¤There was a commotion in the square, and after a while, some people left the Galaxy Sword Sect one after another. It seems that they did not meet the requirements.
宗门广场较往日热闹许多，大师姐像是在分发某样物品。她面前身的修士排成长龙，放眼望去就连几位平日醉心修练的师姐师妹也站在其中。¤Zongmen Square is much more lively than in the past, and the master sister seems to be distributing something. The cultivators in front of her are growing up, and even several senior sisters and sisters who are immersed in practice on weekdays are also standing in it.
你第一次来到大宗门的紧张心情在这绰丽婉约的景色中缓和了几分。¤The nervousness of your first visit to Dazongmen is eased in this beautiful and graceful scenery.
你认真地想了想，还是觉得性命更为重要，毕竟长生的基础是活着。¤You think about it seriously, and you still think that life is more important. After all, the foundation of longevity is to live.
你隐隐约约在浩瀚似海的光幕中瞥见慕容颖的身形，只见她抬手掐了个剑诀，下一秒你便失去了意识。¤You vaguely caught a glimpse of Murongying's figure in the vast sea-like light curtain, and saw her raising her hand to pinch a sword technique, and in the next second you lost consciousness.
首先感谢各位不辞辛劳来到此处参与入门测试，接下来请务必听清在下所讲的每一句话，这将直接关系到诸位能否进入本门。¤First of all, thank you for your hard work here to participate in the introductory test, and then please be sure to listen to every sentence that is said below, which will directly affect whether you can enter this door.
二是灵根资质必须为四灵根及以上。¤The second is that the spiritual root qualification must be four spiritual roots and above.
宗门广场较往日热闹许多，大师姐像是在分发某样物品。她面前的修士排成长龙，放眼望去就连几位平日醉心修练的师姐师妹也站在其中。¤Zongmen Square is much more lively than in the past, and the master sister seems to be distributing something. The cultivators in front of her are growing up, and even a few senior sisters and sisters who are immersed in practice on weekdays are standing in it.
一炷香时间已过，接下来我将开启传送阵带领各位师妹前去金虹剑派。望师妹们多加努力，争取在本届宗门大比中拔得头筹。¤The time for a stick of incense has passed. Next, I will start the teleportation formation and lead all the juniors to the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect. I hope that the juniors will work harder to get the top spot in this Zongmen Grand Competition.
三十日期满，没有通过测试的诸位道友与本派无缘，就随着外务执事一起下山去吧。¤At the end of the 30th day, the fellow daoists who have not passed the test have no chance with the school, so let's go down the mountain with the deacon of foreign affairs.
请问师妹，大家聚集于此是为了......？¤Sister, do you gather here for...?
面对慕容颖的威迫，很快又有几个人离开了人群。¤Faced with Murongying's coercion, several people soon left the crowd.
你二人相谈甚欢，只觉时间飞逝，很快就来到大师姐面前。¤The two of you talked very happily, but felt that time flew by, and soon came to the master sister.
师妹，你且随我来。¤Sister, follow me.
诸位道友，今天是我们星河剑派招收入门弟子的第四天。¤Dear friends, today is the fourth day that our Galaxy Sword Sect recruits disciples.
{shixiong}可是刚历练结束？猎魔试炼不日开启，大师姐正在发放{color=#d0380a}天魔令{/color}给即将启程的弟子呢。¤{shixiong} is the end of the experience? The demon hunting trial will start soon, and the master sister is issuing {color=#d0380a}the order of the gods{/color} to the disciples who are about to set off.
唉，你这次猎魔试炼的表现实在拖我派的后腿，此后可千万勤加修炼，切莫再如此丢本座的脸面。¤Oh, the manifestation of your demon hunting trial this time is dragging me down. From now on, you can practice harder and harder. Don't lose your face like this again.
望各位师妹入门后能勤加修炼，争取早日达到{color=#d0380a}筑基期{/color}修为，成为我派的内门弟子，切莫辜负掌门对你们的期待。¤I hope you can practice hard after you get started, and strive to reach the {color=#d0380a}foundation period{/color} as soon as possible, and become the inner disciples of our school, and don't let down the expectations of the leader.
这之后将由门派剑阵来测试你们是否有入门资格，我会在一旁确保你们的安全。¤After this, the martial arts sword formation will test whether you are eligible for entry, and I will be on the side to ensure your safety.
剑灵......星河剑派这剑阵倒是有点意思，也只有这种底蕴深厚的宗门敢把剑灵当做消耗品用于测试弟子了。¤Sword Spirit ...... Star River Sword School This sword formation is a bit interesting, only this kind of deep-rooted sect dares to use sword spirits as consumables for testing disciples.
一阵蓝光闪过，你回到了宗门大殿。¤A flash of blue light, you returned to the sect hall.
竟是天灵根...师妹，接下来的测试就交由你负责了，我先去禀告掌门师尊。¤It's actually a Heavenly Spiritual Root... Sister, I'll leave you in charge of the next test, I'll report to the Master first.
你硬着头皮冲上前去，孰料屏障并没有影响你的行动，你轻而易举地到达了对面。¤You rush forward with a stiff face, but the barrier does not affect your movement and you reach the opposite side with ease.
不错，今年竟能招到双灵根的弟子，你过去吧。¤Not bad, you've managed to recruit a disciple with double spiritual roots this year, so go over there.
你硬着头皮冲上前去，却只感受到了轻微的阻力，你较为轻松地到达了对面。¤You rushed forward with a hard head, but you felt only a slight resistance, and you reached the opposite side with relative ease.
你硬着头皮冲上前去，费了好大一番力气才冲过屏障。¤You rushed forward with a hard head, and it took a lot of effort to get past the barrier.
你硬着头皮冲上前去，被屏障狠狠地弹回来，结结实实地落在了地上。¤You rushed forward hard and were bounced back hard by the barrier, landing solidly on the ground.
一道映呈着层层水波的灵气屏障挡住了你的去路，想必这就是慕容颖口中的测试之一。你决定¤An aura barrier reflecting layers of water waves blocked your way, so this must have been one of the tests Murong Ying was talking about. You decide
一道映呈着层层水波的灵气屏障，只要灵根资质优上便可以通过。¤An aura barrier with layers of water waves, as long as the spirit root qualification is excellent, you can pass.
小友，入门测试乃是严肃大事，你仍需独自走完，循路向前便是出口，我在剑阵外等你。¤Young friend, the initiation test is a serious matter, you still need to finish it alone, follow the path to the exit, I will wait for you outside the sword formation.
一道锋锐的剑灵向你发起了攻击。¤A sharp sword spirit launches itself at you.
嗯，应该是某种冥想室。¤Well, it should be some kind of meditation room.
这间小屋...待我仔细研究研究。¤This hut... Let me study it carefully.
这条路深处似乎有非常强大的剑灵存在...当然是相对于你而言很强大。¤There seems to be a very powerful sword spirit present deep in this path... Of course it is very powerful relative to you.
依我看...这光幕应该是某种禁制，或许与有灵根资质有关。¤In my opinion... This curtain of light should be some kind of prohibition, perhaps related to having spiritual root qualifications.
怎么啦，丫头？¤What's wrong, girl?
你面前是一个岔路口，左边能依稀看到蓝色的光幕，中间似乎有着剑灵在游荡，右边则只有一间小屋。你决定{w}{w=0.5}¤In front of you is a fork in the road, to the left you can vaguely see a blue curtain of light, in the middle there seems to be a sword spirit wandering, and to the right there is only a hut. You decide {w}{w=0.5}
你在一片剑光构成的水色静室内若有所悟，屈膝入定。¤You are in a water-colored quiet room made of sword light as if you have some understanding and bend your knees to settle.
善，此子悟性甚佳。师尊曾嘱咐我在此入定的修士可直接纳入外门，不必强求其通过屏障。¤Good, this son has a very good understanding. The master has instructed me that cultivators who have settled here can be incorporated directly into the outer gate, and there is no need to force them to pass the barrier.
一间简陋的静室，并无特别之处。¤A simple quiet room, there is nothing special.
一道灵动的剑灵出其不意地出现在你面前。¤A spiritual sword spirit appears in front of you unexpectedly.
大哥别急，我们先招待完客人，再定夺这宝贝的归属如何？¤Big brother, don't worry, let's finish serving the guests first, and then decide where this treasure belongs?
若是普通法器也就算了，这可是件上等的法宝，我怎么会甘心让给你？以大哥你的天赋，这辈子是不可能结丹了，不如成全小弟我，去寻那长生之道。¤If it's a common magic weapon, it's fine. This is a superior magic weapon. How could I willingly give it to you? With your eldest brother's talents, it is impossible to build a pill in this life. It is better to perfect me and find the eternal life Tao.
{vpunch=10,0.5}什么人？¤{vpunch=10,0.5} Who is it?
就这样贸然和他们战斗不是上策，我还是得做好准备再来。¤It's not the best policy to fight them rashly like this, I still have to be prepared to come again.
这次一定要好好教训这帮禾山派修士。¤This time, we must teach this group of He Shan Sect cultivators a good lesson.
嘿，那里来了一个。¤Hey, one came over there.
这“沂山双鬼”少说也有三十几年的交情了，如今居然为了一件宝物争的不可开交，这必定不是寻常法器。¤These Yishan Twin Ghosts have had friendship for more than 30 years, and now they are fighting for a treasure. This must not be an ordinary magic weapon.
（为了件不知道作用的法宝，犯不着去惹上一个元婴期修士...）¤(For a magic weapon that doesn't know its effect, it is impossible to provoke a cultivator in the Nascent Soul Stage...)
哼，真恶心。¤Huh, it's disgusting.
桀桀桀桀....又有新鲜的魂魄自己送上门来了。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie.... Another fresh soul came to the door by himself.
咳咳...师傅他，不会...放过...¤Cough... my master, he won't... forgive you...
少废话，看招！¤Enough talk, take this !
哈哈哈，什么宝贝能让沂山双鬼争成这样，不如拿出来让我也看看？¤Hahaha, what kind of treasure can make the Yishan Twin Ghosts fight like this, why don't you show it out and let me have a look?
你...你居然敢暗算我...¤You...you dare to plot against me...
嗯，这便是了，待大哥我回去参悟几天，有了此宝，你我兄弟二人合力，日后必能纵横天下，哈哈哈哈哈哈。¤Well, that's it. When I go back and understand for a few days, big brother, with this treasure, you and my brothers will work together and we will be able to cross the world in the future, hahahahahaha.
这些禾山道的修士真不把我们沂山派放在眼里，居然敢大摇大摆地在我们的地界儿上闹事。¤These Heshan Dao cultivators really don't take our Yishan School into view, and they dare to make a big fuss on our land boundary.
大哥我也有好几种独门的手法，给大哥我试试，总好过你一个人瞎琢磨。¤Big brother, I also have several unique tricks. Give me a try, it's better than you thinking about it by yourself.
桀桀桀....臭{xiaozi}上次在我们这儿吃的苦头还不够？¤Jie Jie Jie .... Stinky {xiaozi} suffer enough here last time?
还是眼前的宝贝重要，只要不被人看到，谁会知道这事是我干的？¤The treasure in front of you is still important. As long as you are not seen, who will know that I did it?
（这沂山双鬼颇难对付，我还是不要让他们发现为好...）¤(The Yishan twin ghosts are quite difficult to deal with, I still don't let them find out as well...)
这件法宝可是我们一起得手的，有了这件法宝，你我二人合力，面对金丹期的修士也能有一拼之力。你将之把持了有什么用？若不参详出用法来，藏在你手上也不过是废物一件。¤This magic weapon was achieved by us together. With this magic weapon, you and I can work together to face the cultivators of the Golden Core Stage. What use is it for you to control it? If you don't refer to the details, please refer to the usage. Come, hiding in your hands is just a piece of waste.
{vpunch=10,0.5}啊！！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5} Ah!!!
我看我还是在这附近的山头转转，看看能不能抓到一两个落单的。¤I think I'm still going around the hills around here to see if I can catch one or two orders.
这沂山派好歹也是个有筑基期修士的大门派，我还是不要惊动太多人比较好。¤This Yishan sect is at least a big sect with Foundation Establishment cultivators, I'd better not alarm too many people.
还是做好准备再来吧。¤You better be prepared to come again.
大哥，你我相交也有三四十年了，小弟我你还信不过么？等小弟再试几种法门，若是都不成，再换大哥你来。若是小弟试成了，自然也会教给大哥。¤Big brother, you and I have been together for thirty or forty years, can you still believe me, little brother? Wait for the little brother to try a few more methods, if it fails, then change to the eldest brother. If the little brother succeeds, he will naturally teach it to the elder brother. .
没想到这沂山双鬼背后还有一个修为如此高深的前辈，我该怎么办？¤Unexpectedly, there is a senior with such a profound cultivation behind the Yishan Twin Ghosts. What should I do?
哼，找死！¤Huh, looking for death!
大哥多虑了，小弟能有什么私心？大哥若真想试试自己的法门，拿去便是了。¤Big brother is too worried, what selfishness can the younger brother have? If the big brother really wants to try his own method, just take it.
哈哈哈哈，师傅他这么多年不见踪影，算算时间，也该到渡劫的时候了，还能有心思管你我这点小事？¤Hahahaha, Master hasn't been seen for so many years. Counting the years, he should be close to his tribulation. You think he's got time to still care about our petty problems?
哼，那边的小友看了那么久好戏，也该出手了吧。¤Hmph, the little friend over there has been watching a good show for so long, so it's time to make a move.
{vpunch=10,0.5}（糟糕，原来早就被发现了）¤{vpunch=10,0.5} (Oops, it was discovered long ago)
你已经试了那么多次，也不见有什么新手段。我每次问你要，你都推脱不肯，不是有私心是什么？¤You have tried so many times, and you don't see any new methods. Every time I ask you for it, you refuse to refuse. Isn't it what selfishness is?
哦？这倒是罕见，我派已经近百年未有如此资质的弟子加入了。不如就让这位小友拜入我门下如何？¤Oh? It's rare, our Sect hasn't had such a qualified disciple join for nearly a hundred years. How about letting this young friend join my school?
{FirstName}{LastName}，你可曾听说过“天魔眼”？¤{FirstName}{LastName}, have you ever heard of the Heavenly Demon Eye?
修练《凝沙诀》的鸢本仙子擅于通过布下的{color=#d0380a}阵法{/color}辅助，操控灵沙与灵尘进行进攻与防守。¤Fairy Tobimoto, who practiced the Sand Condensation Technique, is good at using the {color=#d0380a}formation{/color} to assist her to control Lingsha and Lingchen to attack and defend.
此环，名为落尘，乃是化尘筑基期修士的绝佳武器，今日便送给你当见面礼了。¤This ring, named Fallen Dust, is an excellent weapon for a cultivator in the foundation-building stage of the transformation of dust, and I will give it to you as a gift today.
你走到冶庚上人身前，行拜师之礼。¤YYou approach Venerable Yigeng and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
恒如真人修炼的是我派秘术《混元引气诀》，战斗时能自如操控一方天地间的{color=#d0380a}引力{/color}，干扰对手以占得上风。¤Heng Ru Zhenren practiced the secret technique Hunyuan Qi Induction Technique of my school. During battle, he could freely control the {color=#d0380a}gravitational force{/color} between the heaven and the earth, and interfere with the opponent to gain the upper hand.
哈哈哈，你这{xiaozi}还是有眼光。¤Hahahaha, {xiaozi} you have quite a discerning eye.
此等资质本座也十分心动，不过还是要看他个人的选择，师弟师妹莫争了罢。¤I'm very please with his aptitude, but it still depends on his personal choice. Junior brothers and sisters, don't dispute it.
你在{color=#d0380a}结丹之前{/color}，就跟着为师学，为师自然不会亏待你。¤Before you {color=#d0380a}contained Pill{/color}, you followed the teacher to learn, and the teacher will naturally not treat you badly.
掌门目前正在闭关，你入内门的事宜便由我代为主持。¤The head is currently in retreat, and I will preside over your entry into the door.
当然，参加猎魔试炼也有不小的危险，虽然门派会有相应的奖励补偿，但是否参与还是全凭自愿。距离下一次的猎魔试炼还有一段时间，你可以去找参加过往届试炼的同门了解情况以后，再作决定。¤Of course, participating in the demon hunting trial is not a small danger. Although the martial arts will have corresponding rewards and compensation, whether to participate is entirely voluntary. There is still some time before the next demon hunting trial, you can go find and participate in it. The colleagues in the previous trials will make a decision after understanding the situation.
{shidi}，我派目前有三位授业长老招收弟子，你想先了解哪一位？¤{shidi}, I currently have three elders recruiting disciples. Which one do you want to know first?
是，长老。¤Yes, elder.
你走到鸢本仙子身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Lady Yuanben and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
大长老，本届的宗门大比的结果出来了，这次夺魁的是{FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}。¤Great Elder, the results of this year's sect competition have come out. This time the winner is {FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}.
呵呵呵，希望你能尊师重道，不要忘恩负义。¤Ha ha ha, I hope you can respect the teacher and respect the Tao, and don't be ungrateful.
也罢，也罢。仙儿，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤Well, that's fine. Xian'er, please tell you {shidi} about the situation of the elders.
回冶庚长老，师尊目前还未传出消息，怕是仍在悟道中。¤Elder Yegeng, my Master has not yet sent any message, I am afraid he is still in deep meditation.
呵呵，你倒是刁滑。小友如此资质，若是从师本座定为亲传弟子，倾囊相授。不知小友你可愿意入我门下？¤Hehe, you're pretty slippery. The little friend is so qualified, if he is appointed as a direct disciple from the teacher's seat, he will give it all. I wonder if you are willing to join me?
的确是纯净的天灵根，没有一丝一毫的杂灵根，这点我看的清清楚楚。¤It is indeed a pure Tianling Root, without a trace of mixed spiritual roots. I can see this clearly.
门内得一天灵根资质的弟子应禀告掌门师兄才是，仙儿，他可曾有什么出关的消息？¤The disciple who has the spiritual root qualifications in the door should tell the head brother, Xian'er, what news has he ever gotten out of the customs?
距离下一次的猎魔试炼还有一段时间，你可以去找参加过往届试炼的同门了解情况以后，再作决定。¤There is still a period of time before the next demon hunting trial. You can go to the colleagues who participated in the previous trials to find out about the situation, and then make a decision.
仙儿，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤Xian'er, please tell you {shidi} about the situation of the elders.
见过长老。¤Well met elders.
长老，{FirstName}{shidi}近日已突破至筑基期，特来禀明此事。¤Elder, {FirstName}{shidi} has recently broken through to the foundation building period, and hereby come to clarify this matter.
冶庚上人是我派大长老，掌门师尊闭关时的门派事务皆由冶庚长老代为处理。他修炼的《五藏炼尘功》能运用{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}之力，最大限度地发挥我派神通威能。¤Master Ye Geng is the chief elder of our sect, and the sect affairs when the master is in retreat are handled by elder Ye Geng on his behalf. The Five-Tibetan Cultivation of Dust he practiced uses the power of {color=#d0380a}the five elements of mutual generation{/color} to maximize the power of my sect's supernatural powers.
禀大长老，今年的招收的外门弟子中，收取到了一名资质鉴定为天灵根的弟子，名叫{FirstName}{LastName}！¤The Great Elder, among the outer disciples recruited this year, a disciple with qualifications identified as Tianlinggen, named {FirstName}{LastName}!
弟子谨记长老教诲。¤The disciples remember the elder's teachings.
你走到恒如真人身前，行拜师之礼。¤You approach Mater Eternal Harmony and perform the ceremony of apprenticeship.
清透的晶体逐渐变得耀眼起来，双色的光芒在其中交缠流动。¤The clear crystal gradually became dazzling, and the two-color light intertwined and flowed in it.
恭喜{shidi}，从今日起你就是我们化尘教的外门弟子了。¤Congratulations {shidi}, from today you are the outer disciple of our Aeonic Sands Temple.
澹台仙从储物囊中拿出一只水晶般通体剔透的细笺递给你，示意你拿住它的另一端。¤The Immortal Tantai took out a thin, crystal-like note from the storage pouch and gave it to you, motioning you to hold the other end of it.
{shidi}，请向其中缓慢地注入灵气。¤{shidi}, please slowly infuse aura into it.
在流沙的遮掩下，你跟随化尘教接引弟子踏入无尽的沙河。一段短暂的空间波动后你们出现在地底的化尘教广场中，倾斜而下的黄沙在中央的巨型阵法内汇聚流转，形成巨大的沙砾旋涡。¤Under the cover of quicksand, you follow the Aeonic Sands Temple to guide the disciples into the endless sand river. After a short period of spatial fluctuation, you appear in the underground Aeonic Sands Temple square, the yellow sand slanting down in the center of the giant formation. Converges and flows inside, forming a huge vortex of gravel.
你既已入我化尘教，务必努力修行，争取早日达到{color=#d0380a}筑基期{/color}修为，成为我派的内门弟子。¤Since you have entered our Sect, you must practice hard to achieve the {color=#d0380a}foundation period{/color} as soon as possible and become an inner disciple of my school.
好不容易有位{shidi}通过测试，我赶着带{ta}面见师姐故还未曾测过，望师姐谅解。¤Finally, someone {shidi} passed the test. I rushed to bring {ta} to meet with Sister Sister, so I haven't tested it yet. I hope Sister Sister will forgive me.
无妨，你且回石窟继续测试其他修士，这位{shidi}交给我就可以了。¤It's okay, you go back to the grotto and continue testing other cultivators, this {shidi} can be handed to me.
清透的晶体逐渐变得光芒四射，纯净的灵气光芒吸引来不少修士的注意。¤The clear crystals gradually became radiant, and the pure aura light attracted the attention of many cultivators.
清透的晶体逐渐变得浑浊起来，五色的光芒在其中杂乱地流窜着。¤The clear crystals gradually became turbid, and the five-color light ran chaotically in them.
入门测试就在那边的石室进行，左数第三间还没有修士占用。道友切记，量力而行。¤The entry test is conducted in the stone room over there. The third room from the left has not yet been occupied by a cultivator. Daoists must remember to do what they can.
你随着他的指引走向门口，穿过铺满沙砾的长廊后到达一间昏暗的石室。¤You follow his guidance to the door, walk through the gravel-covered promenade and arrive at a dim stone room.
大师姐，这位{shidi}已经通过入门测试。¤Eldest sister, this {shidi} has passed the entry test.
宗门广场较往日热闹许多，大师姐像是在分发某样物品。她面前身着化尘教道袍的修士排成长龙，放眼望去就连几位平日醉心修练的师兄弟也站在其中。¤The clan's square is much busier than usual, and the elder sister seems to be distributing some kind of item. In front of her, there were long lines of cultivators wearing the Daoist robes of the Dust Transformation Cult, and as far as the eye could see, even a few of my brothers who were usually intoxicated with cultivation were also standing among them.
五灵根么，罢了。资质虽差但本事尚可，做个外门弟子倒也无妨。¤Five Spiritual Roots, that's all. Although the aptitude is poor, but the ability is acceptable, it doesn't hurt to be an outer disciple.
清透的晶体逐渐变得明亮起来，三色的光芒在其中流窜。¤The clear crystals gradually become brighter, and the light of three colors flows through them.
你先去门派{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}领取入门功法，{color=#d0380a}神兵阁{/color}领取符器，然后再回来找我吧。¤You can first go to the sect's {color=#d0380a}Hidden Scripture Pavilion{/color} to collect your introductory techniques and {color=#d0380a}Divine Armament Pavilion{/color} to collect your talisman weapons, then come back to me.
{shidi}，你随我来。¤{shidi}, follow me.
高大朴拙的土色建筑上镶嵌着澄金的琉璃窗牖，给肃穆的景象增添上几分灵动的色彩。你被淳厚的土系灵气所包围，初到宗门的忐忑散去了一些。¤The tall and unpretentious earth-colored building is inlaid with golden glazed windows, adding a touch of agility to the solemn scene. You are surrounded by the sincere earth element aura, and the uneasiness of the first arrival at the sect has disappeared. .
澹台仙像是怕你溜走般紧紧地抓住了你的手腕，随即转身叮嘱身后的外门执事道：¤The Immortal Tantai grabbed your wrist tightly as if afraid you would slip away, then turned around and told the deacon behind him:
你听从大师姐的话将灵气注入水晶笺，很快水晶笺便产生了变化。¤You followed the master sister's words and poured aura into the crystal note, and the crystal note changed quickly.
你对土之道的感悟略微提升了。¤Your perception of the way of earth has improved slightly.
三灵根，不错，若是勤加修炼便能进入内门，{shidi}你要多加努力。¤Three Spiritual Roots, yes, you can enter the inner gate if you practice harder, {shidi} you have to work harder.
若再有人通过测试麻烦师弟你代为接引，我要先带这位{shidi}面见长老。¤If someone passes the test and troubles Junior Brother for you to take in, I will take this {shidi} to meet the elder first.
清透的晶体逐渐变得斑驳起来，四色的光芒在其中杂乱地流窜着。¤The clear crystals gradually become mottled, and the light of four colors rushes in disorderly.
竟是双灵根...看来不久后内门弟子又会增加一位了。¤It's actually Shuanglinggen... It seems that the inner disciple will be added by another soon.
哦？既能通过测试，可见是个有几分本事的。不知灵根资质如何？¤Oh? Having passed the test, it can be seen that he has some skill. I don't know what Linggen's aptitude is?
四灵根么，比凡人倒是胜上一筹，做个外门弟子也可。¤Siling root, it's better than ordinary people, you can also be an outer disciple.
天灵根...！竟是天灵根！¤Tian Ling Gen...! It was Tian Ling Gen!
你先去门派{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}领取入门功法，{color=#d0380a}神兵阁{/color}领取法器，然后再回来找我吧。¤You first go to the martial art {color=#d0380a} Tibetan Scripture Pavilion{/color} to receive the introductory exercises, {color=#d0380a} Shenbing Pavilion{/color} to receive the magical tools, and then come back to me.

陨铁符剑-主动：两回合后，造成6点剑系伤害¤Meteor Iron Rune Sword-Active: After two rounds, cause 6 points of sword damage
收好吧，¤Stow it away,
说来惭愧，之前战斗我硬吃了几招，如今得先{color=#d0380a}疗伤{/color}才行。我要去{color=#d0380a}客栈{/color}静养些时日。¤Its embarrassing to admit, but in the previous battle I took several blows, so {color=#d0380a}recuperating{/color} should take priority. I'm heading straight to the {color=#d0380a}inn{/color} to rest up.
多谢！倪道友不一同前去看看么？¤Thank you! Fellow Daoist Ni doesn't want to browse the market together?
没想到这东石谷中竟如此繁华，我还是第一次在同一个地方见到这么多的修真之人。¤I didn't expect this East Stone Valley to be so prosperous. This is the first time I have seen so many cultivators in the same place.
倪旭欣说罢大大方方地向你施了一礼，随后大步流星地向客栈走去。你望着东石谷内的热闹繁华，一时间不禁眼花缭乱。¤After Ni XuXin finishes speaking he gives you a generous salute, then strides off towards the inn. You look out over the hustle and bustle of East Stone Valley, and for a moment you can't help but be dazzled.
大可放心！这盛会能延续几百年，背后底蕴非同小可，今年更是轮到{color=#d0380a}宁州四族{/color}主持。哼，就算那帮沂山派杂碎，也不敢在此造次。¤You can rest assured! This event will continue on for hundreds of years, the underlying heritage is very significant. This year, it's the {color=#d0380a}Ning Province's Four Clans{/color} turn to host. Hmph, even that bunch of Mt. Yi sect scum wouldn't dare to make a scene here.
你与倪道友一路谈笑而来，两个初出茅庐的青年的脚步越聊越轻快，越聊越兴奋，不知不觉便已抵达东石谷前。\n¤Together with your new friend Ni XuXin the journey was short and full of laughter and before you knew it you had reached your destination.
嘿嘿，小家伙，看花眼了吧，修仙界可有趣得很，这才多大点地方，走吧，先去{color=#d0380a}坊市{/color}看看，这集会一年一度，过了这村可就没这店了。¤Hehe. Dazzled already kid? You've merely scratched the surface of the world of Cultivators, tis but a drop in the ocean, let's go, first lets head to the {color=#d0380a}Marketplace{/color} to browse, this meeting is held only once a year, it'll be a pity to have to wait another year.
不如我们下个月在{color=#d0380a}伴月楼{/color}碰头。一起去那里的竞拍会上开开眼。¤Why don't we meet at the {color=#d0380a}Moon House{/color} next month. Let's go there together to broaden our horizons at the auction.
这么多好东西就这么摆在街上叫卖，难道不怕危险？¤So many rare and expensive things are just being peddled on the street, aren't they afraid of danger?
哈哈哈，这东石谷盛会{color=#d0380a}一年一次{/color}，能聚拢许多修仙者各取所需，互通有无，机会可难得的很。¤Hahaha, this East Stone Valley event is held {color=#d0380a}Once a year{/color}, many immortal cultivators come to get what they need and exchange what they have. The opportunity is quite rare.
这些灵石{xiongdi}你先收下，看着什么喜欢的就买，可别和我客气！¤You take these spirit stones first {xiongdi}, and buy whatever you like. No need to be polite with me!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}你修行尚浅，不妨去{color=#d0380a}坊市{/color}内多看看，或许能碰到合适的兵器功法，将来行走江湖也多份保障。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}Your cultivation level is still quite shallow, you should give the {color=#d0380a}marketplace{/color} a quick glance. Maybe you might even find a weapon or technique suitable for you. In the future when you roam Jianghu it pays to have insurance.
倪兄弟还在{color=#d0380a}客栈{/color}等我呢，还是别到处乱晃了...¤Brother Ni is still waiting for me at the {color=#d0380a}inn{/color}, better not wander around...
听说二月份会在{color=#d0380a}伴月楼{/color}举办拍卖会，有约在身，外出乱逛怕是会误了时间。¤I hear that there will be an auction held this February at {color=#d0380a}Moon House{/color}, if I wander around I'm afraid I'll miss the appointment.
伴月楼的拍卖会要等到二月份才开始，我还是过段时间再来吧...¤The auction held in the moon house will not start until February, I'd better come back after a while...
哼，说者无意，听者有心罢了。¤Hmph, the speaker has no intention, but the listener has the intention.
若真有姑娘所言这么神奇，不知阁内可还有空位？¤If there is such a miraculous thing a girl said, I wonder if there is still room in the cabinet?
正有此意！¤Right on my mind!
盈手露？¤Welling hands?
亏诸位修炼多年，这么浅显的道理居然都不懂？¤Thanks to all of you who have been practicing for many years, you don't even understand such a simple truth?
原来如此，可惜在下无意此酒，多谢姑娘介绍。¤So that's the case, it's a pity that I don't intend to drink this wine, thank you for the introduction.
你打开纸笺，上面写着几个大字“结束后请至公孙府——公孙季”。¤You open the paper, and it says a few large characters After the end, please go to Gongsun Mansion-Gongsun Ji.
在别有用心的挑拨下，盈手露的加价幅度明显增大，很快便成交。¤Under the ulterior motive of provocation, the price increase of Yingshoulu increased significantly, and the transaction was completed soon.
美酒有价，时间无价，诸位几百几百灵石地加不觉得太寒碜了吗？¤Wine is priceless, time is priceless, don't you think it's too shabby?
见你此举，他颇有兴趣地看了过来，并提笔写下什么派人送至你桌上。¤Seeing your move, he looked over with interest and wrote down what to send to your desk.
{FirstName}道友，公孙道友已经恭候您多时了，请随我来。¤{FirstName}Daoist, Daoist Gongsun has been waiting for you for a long time, please follow me.
为了节省时间，我加价一千灵石。¤In order to save time, I will increase the price by a thousand spiritual stones.
你打开纸笺，上面写着几个大字“勿拍，结束后公孙府见”。¤You open the paper, and it says a few large characters Don't shoot, see you at Gongsun Mansion when it's over.
你本以为这里会充斥着市井般的哄闹声，但与猜测不同，丝竹管弦奏响的雅致曲调伴着素馨的熏香弥散开。透过青萝垂成的蔓帘你隐约看到几桌吃茶的客人，比起风月场所此处更像是别致的茶楼。¤You thought it would be filled with the noise of the market, but unlike guessing, the elegant tunes played by the silk and bamboo orchestras are diffused with the incense of frangipani. You can vaguely see a few tables through the curtain of green leaves. For those who eat tea, this place is more like a chic teahouse than Fengyue place.
你找了个稍为隐蔽的地方落座，很快就有人端来茶水和点心，以及一筒刻着数字的木牌用于稍后的拍卖。你无所事事地翻看着牌筒，突然察觉到一股奇特的灵力波动。然而等你想要仔细探究时，那波动却消失了。¤You found a slightly concealed place to sit, and soon someone brought tea and snacks, as well as a barrel of wooden signs engraved with numbers for later auction. You idly looked at the card barrel and suddenly noticed a A strange spiritual power fluctuation. But when you want to explore it carefully, the fluctuation disappears.
你思索再三，愈发觉得此人无理取闹。准备起身离开。¤You think twice, and you feel that this person is irrational. Prepare to get up and leave.
你打开纸笺，上面写着几个大字“勿拍，结束后请至公孙府——公孙季”。¤You open the paper, and it says Don't shoot, please go to Gongsun Mansion-Gongsun Ji when it's over.
见你加价，他颇有兴趣地看了过来。显然公孙季也认出了你，于是提笔写下什么派人送至你桌上。¤Seeing your price increase, he looked over with interest. Obviously Gongsun Ji also recognized you, so he took a pen to write down what to send to your desk.
一壶茶喝得差不多时，阁内乐声渐弱消失，看样子重头戏即将开场。¤When a pot of tea was almost drunk, the music in the pavilion faded away, and it seemed that the main event was about to begin.
此时一个小厮在你离开之时，递上一个纸笺。¤At this time, a small servant handed a piece of paper to you when you left.
细看之下，你越发觉得这人眼熟。你低头回想，终于记起他是与你在英杰会上交手的公孙家少主——公孙季。¤When you take a closer look, you feel that this person is more familiar. You look down, and finally remember that he is the young master of the Gongsun family-Gongsunji who fought with you at the Yingjie Meeting.
女子掩唇一笑，淡淡的心字香味道随着衣袂摆动传来，你不由得心神荡漾。¤The woman covered her lips and smiled, and the faint scent of the word of heart came along with the swing of the clothes, and you couldn't help but feel excited.
他大概出于什么目的在哄抬价格，想着干脆做个顺水人情，你举起了加价一千灵石的木牌。¤He is probably driving up the price for some reason, and thinking of just being a good favor, you raised the wooden sign that increased the price by a thousand spirit stones.
闻言，那位修士略有不悦地眯起了眼睛。¤After hearing this, the cultivator narrowed his eyes slightly displeased.
仙长真是来得好不如来得巧，盈手露乃听雨阁的秘酿，一月只供一坛。此酒以天材地宝泡制，饮者可引动自身与天地灵气的共鸣。凡人一盏延寿数十年，修士一坛修为精进数十载，因珍稀故以拍卖的形式售出。¤Xianzhang is really good to come. It is the secret brew of Tingyu Pavilion. It only serves one jar a month. This wine is brewed with the treasures of heaven and earth, and the drinker can inspire resonance with the aura of heaven and earth. Ordinary people. One has been prolonged for decades, and the cultivator’s cultivation base has been refined for decades. Because it is rare, it is sold in the form of auction.
一片嘈杂声中传出不耐烦的声音，你循声望去，只见一位衣着不凡的修士拍案而起。¤There is an impatient voice amidst the noise, you follow the fame, and you see a cultivator who is very well-dressed and shoots the case.
拍品起价5000灵石，每次加价不得低于100灵石。¤The price of the lot starts at 5000 Lingshi, and each increase shall not be less than 100 Lingshi.
仙长也是为了今夜的盈手露而来吧？¤Xianzhang also came to show his hands tonight, right?
阁下成心与我作对？¤Your Excellency deliberately opposed me?
欢迎各位光临我阁，我是听雨阁掌柜夏云蔚，此次盈手露的拍卖将由我来主持。¤Welcome to my pavilion. I am Xia Yunwei, the treasurer of Tingyu Pavilion. I will preside over the auction of this time.
只见一位穿戴着华丽衣饰的女子莲步轻移，走上阁内表演用的舞台。她轻轻招了招手，台下小厮便将酒坛抱至台中的桌上。¤I saw a woman wearing gorgeous clothes, Lianbu, moved lightly and stepped onto the stage for performances in the pavilion. She beckoned gently, and the young man under the stage hugged the wine jar to the table in Taichung.
只是价格让你觉得即便是九天仙子亲自斟酒也有所不值，或许这就是有钱人的消遣。¤It's just that the price makes you feel that even Jiutian Fairy pours the wine by himself is not worth it. Maybe this is the pastime of the rich.
我看阁下倒不像无意之言，手下见真章如何？¤I don't think your Excellency is like an unintentional statement. How about seeing the real chapter?
话音刚落，台下加价的木牌已经争先恐后地举了起来。你决定¤As soon as the voice fell, the wooden sign for price increase in the audience was scrambling to raise it. You decide.
你不甘示弱地举起木牌，几轮加价过后，一个不耐烦的声音从远处传来，你循声望去，只见一位衣着不凡的修士拍案而起。¤You raised the wooden sign not to be outdone. After a few rounds of price increases, an impatient voice came from a distance, and you followed the reputation and saw a cultivator who was well-dressed attacking the case.
想起之前收到的纸签，你决定前往公孙府一探究竟。¤Remembering the paper lottery you received earlier, you decide to go to Gongsun Mansion to find out.
刚走近此地不久，你便感受到周天的灵气渐渐浓郁了起来，看来这附近必有一处灵脉。¤Shortly after approaching this place, you will feel the spiritual energy around the sky gradually thickened, it seems that there must be a spiritual vein in the vicinity.
尽管这洞府的外壁和很粗糙，更谈不上有什么装饰，但好歹已经可以在此闭关修炼了，没准以后会越来越好的。¤Although the outer walls of this cave and very rough, not to mention decorative, but at least can already be here to retreat cultivation, may be in the future will be better and better.
拿出阵旗和几块灵石，你在坐台的四周又布下了一个小型的聚灵阵。虽说灵眼的聚灵效果不俗，但也算是聊胜于无。¤Take out the formation flag and a few spiritual stones, you laid another small spirit gathering array around the sitting platform. Although the spirit eye's spirit gathering effect is not bad, but it is better than nothing.
你御起法宝，三下五除二便开辟了一个基础的洞府雏形出来，又细致地在灵眼的附近为自己雕刻了一个修炼用的坐台。¤You have opened up a basic cave in three steps, and meticulously carved a cultivation platform for yourself near the spirit eye.
还是再去其它地方看看吧。¤It is better to go to other places to see.
要在此处开辟洞府么？¤To open up a cave here?
你这{xiaozi}运气着实不错，连这种难得一遇的灵眼都被你给撞上了。¤This {xiaozi} is really lucky, even this kind of rare spiritual eye was hit by you.
你刚一走近此地，一股浓郁的灵气就扑面而来...¤As soon as you approached this place, a dense aura came over you...
灵眼？¤Spiritual Eye?
这附近其它地方的灵气如此稀薄，想必是因为都被这个灵眼汇聚到了此地。¤The spirit energy in other places in the vicinity is so thin, so it must be because all of it has been gathered here by this spirit eye.
你别小看这个灵眼，它汇聚灵气的能力可比你布上十个普通的聚灵阵都要有用的多。¤Don't underestimate this spiritual eye, its ability to gather spiritual energy is much more useful than you can lay ten ordinary spiritual formation.
若是在这里开辟洞府，可比选那些普通的灵脉要强得多，未来闭关修炼定能事半功倍。¤If you open a cave here, it is much stronger than choosing those ordinary spiritual veins, and you will be able to do twice as much with half the effort in the future.
此地已是方圆几里内灵气最为浓郁之处，尽管用肉眼无法看见，但你依稀感觉到附近已有几处处于阵法保护之下的洞府。¤This place is the most dense spiritual energy in a few miles around, although you can not see with the naked eye, but you can vaguely feel that there are several caves in the vicinity under the protection of the formation.
看来这里便是这处灵脉较为核心的区域了，若是在此处开辟洞府，也许是个不错的选址。¤It seems that this is the core area of this spiritual vein, if you open a cave here, it may be a good site.
拿出阵旗和几块灵石，你在坐台的四周又布下了一个小型的聚灵阵，你能感受到周天的灵气很快便向这个方向涌了过来。¤You can feel the spiritual energy around the sky quickly surging in this direction.
此地已经接近{$shan}的外围，位置隐蔽不易被发现，原本倒是一处不错的选址。¤This place is close to the periphery of {$shan}, the location is hidden and not easy to be found, originally it was a good site.
可惜附近的灵气过于稀薄，若在此处开辟洞府，即使布下聚灵阵，修炼速度也远远比不上在门派中快，实在得不偿失。¤Unfortunately, the nearby spiritual energy is too thin, if you open a cave here, even if you set up a spiritual formation, the speed of cultivation is far less than in the sect, it really does not pay off.
随着你不断往这个方向深入，周天的灵气竟愈发稀薄起来。或许此地并不是一个开辟洞府的理想场所？¤As you continue to go deeper and deeper in this direction, the spiritual energy around the sky is getting thinner and thinner. Perhaps this place is not an ideal place to open a cave?
还是不要再来这里了...¤It's better not to come here again...
你饶有兴致地观察了一阵，很快便找到了离开大阵的方式。¤You observe with interest for a while, and soon find your way out of the big formation.
看来这应该是某位同门师兄在自己洞府外设下的阵法，只有困人之效，却不伤人。¤It seems that this should be a formation set up by a fellow senior brother outside his cave, which only has the effect of trapping people, but not hurting them.
这阵法布置的颇为高明，与周围环境融为一体，即便是你也未能及时发现。¤This formation is quite cleverly arranged, and the surrounding environment into one, even you can not be detected in time.
雾气渐渐浓郁了起来，对阵道略有研究的你立刻警觉起来，自己果然已经身陷幻雾迷阵之中。¤The fog gradually thickened, and you immediately alerted to the slight study of the formation, you really have been trapped in the illusionary fog maze.
索性那人没有恶意，否则自己恐怕已经陷入了极为危险的境地。¤So that the person did not have malicious intent, otherwise you are afraid that you have been caught in an extremely dangerous situation.
你不由地惊出一身冷汗，原来你已在不知不觉中陷入了别人布下的幻雾阵法之中。¤You can't help but to break out in a cold sweat, so you have unknowingly fallen into the Mirage Mist Array laid by others.
不知在此地走了多久，当你回过神来之时，才发现自己又回到了原地。¤I don't know how long you walked here, when you come back to your senses, only to find yourself back in the same place.
雾气渐渐浓郁了起来，你莫名的感到一阵恍惚...¤The fog gradually thickened, and you inexplicably felt a trance...
你虽有金丹修为，但却对阵道一窍不通，因此毫无察觉。¤Although you have jindan cultivation, but you know nothing about the formation dao, so you do not notice.
草丛之中，点点银光忽明忽暗，你走近一瞧，才发现是一颗颗晶莹的露珠凝结在草叶之上。¤Among the grass, a little silver light suddenly bright and dark, you get closer to see, only to find a crystal dew condensed on the grass leaves.
这是...¤This is...
这百草露只有在灵气浓郁的地方才会凝结而成，可此地灵气如此稀薄，倒是奇怪...¤The Panacea Dew can only form in places where the spiritual energy is dense, but this place is so thin in qi, it is strange...
尽管这洞府的外壁还很粗糙，更谈不上有什么装饰，但好歹已经可以在此闭关修炼了，没准以后会越来越好的。¤Although the outer walls of this cave are still rough, not to mention decorative, it is at least possible to retreat and train here, and it is possible that it will get better and better in the future.
你打算先调查¤You plan to investigate first
还有些地方没调查完，我再检查一下吧。¤There are still some places that have not been investigated, let me check again.
房间里十分整洁，书架上的花带来一种雅致的氛围。¤The room is very tidy, and the flowers on the bookshelves bring an elegant atmosphere.
桌案上十分整洁，你上下翻找一通，最后在桌角发现了一枚残破的玉简。¤The table is very neat and tidy. You go up and down and find a broken jade slip at the corner of the table.
枕头下，被褥里，床帐后你都翻了个遍，却什么也没发现。正当你失望地打算调查下个地方时，脚底踩到了什么硬邦邦的东西——一小块玉简碎片。¤Under the pillow, in the bedding, and after the bed netting, you turned over and found nothing. Just as you were disappointed to investigate the next place, you stepped on something hard on the sole of your foot-a small piece of jade slip.
花瓶里的海棠已经变成了干花。¤The crabapples in the vase have turned into dried flowers.
调查得差不多了，还是赶快离开以免被发现......¤The investigation is almost done, but leave as soon as possible to avoid being discovered...
正合我意，倪兄请。¤My thoughts exactly, Brother Ni, please.
要是你准备好了，就来{color=#d0380a}客栈{/color}碰头，咱们一起出发。¤If you are ready to leave, join me at the {color=#d0380a}inn{/color}, and we'll set off together.
倪兄何故唉声叹气？¤Why are you sighing Brother?
小菜一碟！只要到了{color=#d0380a}武陵城{/color}下，我自有办法。这可是我第五次离家出走了，经验丰富！¤A piece of cake! As long as I get to {color=#d0380a}Wuling City{/color}, I'll come up with a plan. This is the fifth time I've run away from home. I have extensive experience!
伴月楼拍卖会就要开始了，一起去看看如何？¤The auction at the Moon House is about to start, how about we have a quick look?
前往赴约，随着人群向着伴月楼走去，刚进大厅，只见楼内装饰古朴典雅，还未来得及定睛细看，身后便传来一阵爽朗的招呼声。¤As soon as I entered the hall, I saw that the building was elegantly decorated, and before I could take a closer look, a cheerful greeting came from behind me.
哎...终于结束了。¤Hey... it's finally over.
才没多久不见，你的气息就沉稳不少，看来{xiongdi}比我修炼用心多了。¤It hasn't been long since I've seen you, your breath is quite calm and steady, it seems {xiongdi} is much more attentive than I am in my cultivation.
还不是因为……唉，迟早你也会知道的。¤Well it's because... sigh, you would have found out sooner or later.
哈哈，原来兄弟真是倪家少爷，失敬失敬。不过要离开这一带，必然经过武陵城，岂不是自投罗网？¤Haha, it turns out that my brother is really the young master of the Ni family. My bad my bad I must have been very discourteous. However, if you want to leave this area, you must pass through Wuling City, so aren't you walking straight into a trap?
这次主办方就是我们倪家，没想到前来主持的还是个熟人。我这才刚逃出来没半年，一招摇准被抓回武陵城。我可还还盼着跟你去闯荡一番呢。¤This time, the organizer is our Ni family, and I didn't expect that the person who came to host the event was an acquaintance. I've only just escaped for half a year, so I'm sure I'll be caught back in Wuling City if I wander around. I'had hoped to continue our journey together with you to make a name for myself.
书架上并没有什么值得注意的线索，但其中一本书很多字被抠掉了。¤There is no noteworthy clue on the bookshelf, but many words in one of the books have been cut out.
你推开窗，一个信封飘了进来。修士大多使用玉简传书，书信是谁送来的呢？¤You opened the window and an envelope floated in. The cultivators mostly used jade slips, who sent the letters?
大堂里空荡荡的，长老们今日应该没有事情需要商议。¤The lobby is empty. The elders should have nothing to discuss today.
纸篓里除了废纸什么也没有。¤There is nothing but waste paper in the paper basket.
床铺十分整洁，你不禁怀疑这间屋子真的有人居住吗？¤The bed is so neat and tidy, you can't help but wonder if this room is actually inhabited?
柜子里只有一些洗干净的衣物。你不死心地又翻了一遍，最后在月白色长衫中找到了一张叠好的纸片。¤There were only some clean clothes in the cabinet. You went through it again without giving up, and finally found a folded piece of paper in the moon-white gown.
窗明几净的房间，不知为何看起来毫无生气。¤A room with bright and clean windows looks lifeless for some reason.
倪旭荣的书架上净是些看不懂的书，你将它们放回原位。¤Ni Xurong's bookshelf is full of unreadable books. Put them back in place.
走进屋内，只觉整洁。¤When I walked into the house, I felt neat and tidy.
（林府修士都擅长神识，这长老境界又比我高，仅靠神识没有发现也是正常，不如再敲打敲打试试。）¤（Forest House Vagrant Cultivators are good at soul sense, and this elder realm is higher than me, it is normal not to rely only on soul sense to find, why not try to knock again.
（难道是我猜错了？趁着还有时间，赶紧去三长老的居所调查吧，希望能有所发现。）¤（Could it be that I'm wrong? While there's still time, hurry up and investigate the Third Elder's residence, hopefully we'll find something.）
窗明几净，罕有尘杂。¤The windows are bright and clear, and there is little dust and clutter.
虽说是对鉴定没有深入研究过，但即便只是粗浅的感受一番台座上所镌刻聚灵阵的复杂程度和强大效用，也不难猜出此等台座乃非凡之物。造价甚至可能要高于寻常宗门金丹长老的本命法宝。¤Although there is no in-depth study of the identification, but even if only a rough feeling on the pedestal engraved on the complexity and powerful effect of the spiritual array, it is not difficult to guess that these pedestals are extraordinary things. The cost may even be higher than the ordinary clan Jindan elders' native magic treasure.
你简单的翻看了这本书，没发现什么特别的。¤You briefly looked through the book, did not find anything special.
这台座初见时没什么特殊的，你走进了仔细查看才发现竟是由念铜所铸。¤There is nothing special about this pedestal at first sight, and you step in for a closer look before you realize that it is actually cast from numinous copper.
（哼哼，得来全不费工夫。我也该去见大长老了。）¤（Hmph, it took no time at all to get here. It's time for me to go see the Grand Elder.）
一张被涂抹得乌漆墨黑的纸吸引了你的注意，从没被涂掉的画面看来这似乎是一张地图。¤A piece of paper smeared in black and black attracts your attention. From the unpainted picture, it seems to be a map.
（等等！这一笔的备注是冲虚！呵呵，这老鬼也真是舍得，看来真是寿元无多，找不到其他方法突破了，只得大出血。）¤（Wait! The note on this one is Chong Xu! Oh, this old devil is also really willing, it seems really Lifespan is not much, can not find other ways to break through, only to bleed.）
此时阵法正在散发着几不可见的微弱光芒。虽不知道是做什么用的，但对你一个闯入者来说，肯定不是什么好事。¤At this time the Array is emitting a faint light that is not visible. I don't know what it's for, but it's certainly not good for you, an intruder.
你谨慎地检查了衣柜，没有有用的发现。¤You cautiously checked the closet, no useful findings.
近旁摆放着一盆修剪过的玉桂盆栽。¤A trimmed jade laurel potted plant was placed near the side.
一开门，各种物事涌入你的眼帘。字画、盆栽、玉石摆件、香炉、书籍……还有些一眼看不出功用的小玩意见缝插针般的塞满了剩下的角落。¤Once you open the door, all kinds of things pour into your eyes. Paintings and calligraphy, potted plants, jade ornaments, incense burners, books ...... also some at a glance can not see the function of the gadgets see the needle stuffed with the rest of the corner.
看起来像是装饰，但当你靠近时锋锐的剑气扑面而来，似乎这把剑鞘曾装过品质不凡的剑。¤It looks like a decoration, but when you get closer, the sharp sword aura hits your face. It seems that this scabbard once contained an extraordinary sword.
这是一个修炼用的灵石台座，上刻聚灵阵，应该是苗矮上人平日修炼静修之处。¤This is a Spiritual stone pedestal for cultivation, with a spirit gathering Array engraved on it, which should be the place where Lord Miao Dwarf cultivates and meditates on a regular basis.
但你用神识仔细地检查了台座，却没有任何发现，连一丝不和谐之处都没能发觉。¤But you carefully examined the pedestal with soul sense, but did not find anything, not even a trace of discord could not detect.
你进入苗矮上人的居所。¤You entered the dwelling of Miao Dwarf.
你随意的翻看着桌上散乱的杂物，却没有有用的发现。¤You casually looked through the miscellaneous items scattered on the table, but found nothing useful.
即使处于闭关中，倪府的下人仍仔细地打扫了倪振东的房间。¤Even in retreat, Ni's servants cleaned Ni Zhendong's room carefully.
墙上的各色字画，皆无署名，也不知从何而来。其中一副似有剑意透纸而出吸引了你的目光，但上前查看时又未发现丝毫特殊之处。¤The wall paintings and calligraphy of various colors, are not signed, and I do not know where they came from. One of them seems to have Sword through the paper and attracted your attention, but did not find the slightest special place when you went up to see.
桌上仅有一个砚台，一个笔架，若干支毛笔，和一本名唤《苗矮杂记》的书籍而已。¤The table only has an ink stone, a pen stand, a number of brushes, and a book called Miao Dwarf Miscellaneous Records.
桌上竟是用些略含灵气的杂物摆了一个微型阵法，由于之前被其他物事盖住，竟是瞒过了你的检查。¤The table is actually a miniature Array with some slightly aura-containing miscellaneous things, which was actually concealed from your inspection because it was covered by other things before.
（这...竟是三长老的私账！他暗中吞没了如此多的财物，上交天星城的整体营收竟还在连年上涨...）¤(This... It is actually the private account of the Third Elder! He secretly swallowed so much wealth, the overall revenue turned over to the Heavenly Star City is actually still rising year after year...)
你用神识扫过台座和盆栽，没有可疑的地方。¤You use your soul sense to sweep through the pedestal and potted plants, there is nothing suspicious.

你找谁？¤Who are you looking for?
她的语气不善，看起来不太欢迎你的来访。¤Her tone was not good, and she did not seem to welcome your visit.
大婶可听过东边海上的岱舆山？¤Ma'am, have you ever heard of Mount Taiji on the east coast?
我还是去问问别人吧...¤I'd better go ask someone else...
想来是出于对外人的警惕，他说完便关上了门。¤Thinking it was out of caution for outsiders, he finished and closed the door.
不知这位兄弟可听过东边海上的岱舆山？¤I wonder if this brother has ever heard of Daiji Mountain on the sea to the east?
不曾听说，但住在对面的阿三经常出海，你不如去他那问问吧。¤I have not heard of it, but San, who lives across the street, often goes to sea, so why don't you go to his place and ask?
请问何事？¤What is it, please?
门打开了一条小缝，他有些谨慎地打量着你。¤The door opens a small crack and he surveys you somewhat cautiously.
我还是去对面看看吧...¤I'd better go across the street and see...

你若不是修士，最好不要掺和此事。¤If you are not a cultivator, you had better not get involved in this matter.
阿三话已至此，你决定不再隐瞒自己的修士身份，将自己寻找天蝉灵叶的事情告诉了他。¤As Ah San finishes his words, you decided not to conceal your identity as a cultivator any longer and tell him of your search for the Skyscada Leaf.
阿三兄弟可是遇上了什么难事？¤Has Brother Ah San encountered any difficult problems?
你是修士？¤You are a cultivator?
他的家中似乎出了什么变故，方才这小子有所隐瞒，你若想知道那岱舆山的消息不如做个顺水人情。¤His family seems to have had some kind of change, the kid is hiding something, if you want to know about that Daiji Mountain why don't you do a favor?
显然阿三也看到了血迹，他双拳紧握，睚眦欲裂，一副怒火中烧的模样。¤Apparently San also saw the blood stains, his fists clenched and his jealousy cracked, a look of anger.
毕钟天...我饶不了你！¤Bi Zhongtian... I can't spare you!
看到屋内的景象，他面色苍白地冲了进去。你紧随其后，除了东倒西歪的家具外，墙角一滩鲜红的血迹吸引了你的注意。¤Seeing the scene inside the house, he rushed in with a pale face. You followed closely behind, and in addition to the furniture that had fallen to the east, a puddle of bright red blood in the corner attracted your attention.

阮娘！！！¤Ruan Niang!!!
你是阿三...？我听镇上的居民说你曾经去过东海，此次是来打听些关于海上仙山的事情。¤You are San...? I heard from the town residents that you have been to the East Sea, this time to inquire about some things about the sea fairy mountain.
虽然我时常出海捕鱼，但未曾见过你口中的什么仙山，{xiongdi}请回吧。¤Although I often go out to the sea to fish, but have not seen what immortal mountain you say, {xiongdi} please go back.
身后突然传来的声音吓了你一跳，你转过身去，发现不知何时镇上的居民来到了这里。¤A sudden voice from behind you startles you, you turn around and find that somehow the town's residents have arrived.
我是来拜访这间屋子的主人的，但他好像不在屋内，兄弟可知他去哪了？¤I have come to visit the owner of this house, but he does not seem to be in the house. Do you know where he has gone, brother?
可是我并不认识你，你特意找上门来所为何事？¤But I don't know you, so what did you come to the door for?
你悄悄地凑近门缝，向屋内看去。¤You quietly approached the door and looked inside the house.
只见屋内一片狼藉，桌椅皆倒在地上，瓷碗瓷碟碎了一地，你不禁大吃一惊。¤You were shocked to see that the house was in a mess, with tables and chairs on the floor and china bowls and plates broken all over the place.
你站在这鬼鬼祟祟地干什么？¤What are you doing standing here sneaking around?
难道是阿三不在家...？¤Could it be that San is not at home...?
你不死心地用力敲了敲门，孰料木门并没有拴上。¤You knocked hard on the door, but the wooden door was not chained.
老旧的木门发出吱嘎的声响，被你推开了一条缝隙。¤The old wooden door creaked and you pushed it open a crack.
十有八九是鲛人族氏，我猜这阮五娘亦是鲛人化形。¤The most important thing is that it is a shark clan, I guess this Ruan Wuniang is also a shark in the form of.
我怜惜阮娘的手，不愿让她受织布劳苦。奈何前些日子海上不平静，家里吃食短缺，阮娘为补贴家用便打算纺一匹霁光锦出来。¤I pity Ruan Niang's hands, do not want her to suffer from weaving. However, some days ago the sea is not calm, the family food shortage, Ruan Niang to subsidize the family will plan to spin a horse light brocade out.
取鲛人鳞片磨粉混入染缸，再将丝线浸入染料，以此线织成的布料在光下可似鲛人鳞片般熠熠生辉，这便是鲛纱。¤Take the shark scales grinding powder mixed into the dye bath, and then the silk thread dipped into the dye, the thread woven fabric in the light can be like shark scales like glittering, this is the shark yarn.
“鲛人鳞片？那这阮氏莫非......？”¤Shark scales? Then this Ruan is not ......?
霁光锦...我似乎在什么地方听说过这东西。¤Clear light brocade... I seem to have heard of this somewhere.
千年前这布料所制的道袍在修士中风靡一时，后因华而不实又被厌弃。要是我的记忆没出现偏差，霁光锦原名鲛纱，一帮修士附庸风雅偏要更名为霁光锦。¤Thousands of years ago Daoist robes made of this fabric were popular among cultivators for a while, then they were disliked again because they were flashy and unrealistic. If my memory wasn't off, the original name of the fabric was Sailor's Veil, and a group of cultivators wanted to change it to Sailor's Veil.
“鲛纱？”¤Sailor?
听了棠阿三的解释，你们决定早些前往毕钟天所在之地，救回阮五娘。¤After listening to Tong Ah San's explanation, you decided to go to Bi Zhong Tian's place earlier to save Ruan Wuniang.
阮娘故乡便是岱舆山，若想知道更详细的消息只有救出阮娘后再向她打听了。¤Ruan Niang's hometown is Daiji Mountain, if you want to know more detailed information, you can only ask her after rescuing Ruan Niang.
我只知道此山住民有擅阵法者，我们看到的迷雾皆为阵法的障眼术。¤I only know that there are people who are good at formations in this mountain, and the mist we see is a blindfold of the formations.
正是，你可知道怎么到岱舆山去？¤Exactly, do you know how to go to Daiji Mountain?
你说的可是东海上的岱舆山？¤Are you talking about Daiji Mountain on the East Sea?
这贼窝就在镇子东侧的毕府，想来阮娘便是被掳到了那里。这歹人竟连着纺车同未织完的霁光锦一并带走了，实在可恨！¤The thief's nest is in the east of the town, Bi House, I think Ruan Niang was taken there. The thief took the spinning wheel and the unfinished brocade, which is really hateful!
贼窝？¤A den of thieves?
毕钟天炼气有好一阵了，不过他那贼窝喽啰众多，皆是他收回去的弟子。仗着有几分修为整天和毕钟天一样不学无术，到处向镇上的居民索要财物。¤Bi Zhongtian has been refining qi for a while, but he has a large number of minions in that den of thieves, all of whom are his retrieved disciples. With a few points of cultivation all day and Bi Zhongtian as uneducated, everywhere to the residents of the town to ask for property.
你可知他大概什么修为，是否好对付？¤Do you know what his approximate cultivation level is and whether it is easy to deal with?
这毕钟天仗着修士身份横行霸道，欺凌弱小，永安镇被他搞得乌烟瘴气。我本想带着阮娘去武陵城暂避风头，没想到还没离开就出了事...¤This Bi Zhongtian relies on his cultivator status to run amok, bullying the weak, and the town of Yong'an is in chaos. I wanted to take Ruan Niang to Wuling City for a while, but I didn't expect that something would happen before I left...
熟料她刚织了不到一尺便被上门讨钱的毕钟天看见，他死缠烂打要阮娘替他织布卖钱，我二人仗着有些修为与他缠斗起来，他见奈何不得我俩便匆忙离去。想必他贼心不死，一直谋划带人上门将我娘子掳走！¤The two of us fought with him on the basis of our cultivation, and he left in a hurry when he saw that he could not help us. I think he will not die, he has been planning to bring people to the door to take my mother away!
只是阮氏隐居山林，鲜少现世，因此霁光锦有价无市，千金难求。¤But Ruan's hidden in the mountains, seldom appear in the world, so the light brocade has a price, hard to find a thousand dollars.
阮娘...并非永安镇上的人，阮氏一族擅长织布，以阮氏秘法织出的锦帛在太阳下金光闪烁，在月亮下波光粼粼，就连灯火映照也会泛出柔和的微光，故名霁光锦。¤Ruan... The Ruan clan is good at weaving, and the brocade woven by the Ruan secret method shimmers in the sun and sparkles in the moon, and even the light reflects a soft glow, so it is called Jin Guang Jin.
棠阿三有些迟疑地闭上了嘴，像是在思考要不要继续说下去。¤Tang A-san closed his mouth somewhat hesitantly, as if he was thinking about whether to continue.
阮娘名唤阮眉，因家中排行老五，镇上的人多唤她五娘。¤Ruan Niang's name is Ruan Mei, because the fifth in line in the family, the people in town call her the fifth mother.
我以捕鱼为生，和阮娘也是在海上认识的。¤I fish for a living, and Ruan Niang also met at sea.
我本名棠山，因发音相似总被镇上人叫成棠三，久而久之他们便直接唤我阿三了。¤My name is Tangshan, because of the similarity of pronunciation is always called by the people in town as Tangsan, and over time they will directly call me San.
真可怜，年纪轻轻咋就整的脑袋不灵光了呢...¤It's sad how young you are and how your brain is not working well...
谁啊，干啥玩意儿啊？¤Who is it, what is it?
这位弟兄可听过东边海上的岱舆山？¤This brother has heard of Daiji Mountain on the east side of the sea?
我家住这儿可老些年了，从来就没见过东边海上有山，大{xiongdi}还是早些回家吧。¤I have lived here for many years, never seen a mountain on the sea in the east, big {xiongdi} or go home early.
不知为何，他有些怜悯地看了你一眼，然后关上了门。你凭着修真者超凡的听力听到他在屋内喃喃自语。¤For some reason, he looked at you with some pity, and then closed the door. You hear him muttering inside the house with the transcendent hearing of a cultivator.
平平无奇的商铺，今日似乎没有开张。¤The mediocre store doesn't seem to be open today.
手脚麻利点！像个娘们儿似的磨磨唧...娘的，骂顺嘴了，忘了你他妈的本来就是娘们儿。¤Be quicker! Like a pussy... Motherfucker, I forgot that you're a fucking pussy.
混账东西！¤Bastard!
阿三显然见不得五娘受一丁点委屈，面有怒色地看向了你。你向他点头示意，他冲上前一脚踹开了木门。¤San, who obviously couldn't bear to see Wuniang suffer a bit, looked at you with anger. You nod to him, he rushed forward and kicked open the wooden door.
门内情形被一五大三粗的男修遮得严严实实，想必他就是阿三口中的毕钟天了。¤The situation inside the door was tightly covered by a big, thick male cultivator, who must be the Bi Zhongtian that San was talking about.
来的什么人！要干什么事！¤Who's here! What are you doing?
你们还没踏进屋子，就听见里面传来震耳欲聋的呵斥声。¤Before you could step into the house, you heard a deafening rebuke from inside.
说罢，毕钟天就向你们的方向冲了过来。¤After saying that, Bi Zhongtian rushed in your direction.
别以为找了个帮手老子就怕你，有本事手下见真章！¤Don't think that I'm afraid of you just because you've got a helper, see if you can do it!
“果真是有什么样的师父就有什么样的徒弟...”¤It's true that what kind of master has what kind of disciple...
你掳了阮娘，还问我们来干什么，真是欺人太甚！¤You took Ruan Niang and asked us what we were doing here, what a bully!
你用神识试探，发现此人虽有炼气修为，但体内灵气杂驳，隐有丹毒入体之相。看来他的修为是丹药堆砌而成，但增长修为的丹药价格昂贵，普通百姓根本负担不起。¤You use your soul sense to test and find that although this person has Qi refinement cultivation, but his body has mixed spiritual energy, and there is a hidden phase of Dan poison into his body. It seems that his cultivation is piled up by pills, but the price of pills to grow cultivation is expensive, ordinary people simply can not afford.
“看来这毕钟天能在此地作威作福，定是背后有人撑腰。”¤It seems that this Bi Zhongtian is able to act in this place, must be backed by someone behind him.
就是！放肆！你知道这是谁的地盘儿吗！¤That's it! How dare you! You know whose territory this is!
“这也太不学无术了...”¤This is too uneducated...
放...放...放...¤What... Let... Let...
放肆！¤Unbridled!
他们似乎把你当成了普通百姓，叫嚣着要让你长点记性。你看着他们嚣张至极的模样，决定出手给他们一点教训。¤They seem to treat you like an ordinary citizen and scream to teach you a lesson. You look at their arrogance and decide to teach them a lesson.
你一踏入此地，便有几个衣着富贵，土财主状的百姓围了上来。你能察觉到他们身上微薄的灵气，这些应该就是阿三口中毕钟天的弟子了。¤As soon as you step into the place, several richly dressed, wealthy, landlord-like people surround you. You can detect the meager aura in their bodies, these should be the disciples of Bi Zhongtian as San said.
小的有眼不识泰山！大侠饶命！仙师饶命！¤I have eyes that do not know Mount Tai! Spare my life, great hero! Immortal Lord spare my life!
你不愿多做纠缠，他感恩戴德地跑出了毕府。¤You do not want to dwell on it, he thankfully ran out of Bi House.
此地堆放着粮食腊肉，以及各种珠宝首饰，想来是毕钟天从镇民那搜刮来的财物。¤This place is stacked with grain and bacon, as well as a variety of jewelry, I think Bi Zhongtian scavenged from the townspeople that belongings.
凡人的东西你用不上，棠阿三对此也不感兴趣。¤You can't use the mortal stuff, and Tong Ah San is not interested in it.
你简单翻找了一下，将其中堪堪有用的丹药收进了储物袋。¤You simply rummage around and put the useful pills into the storage bag.
他一边大喊一边一溜烟儿地跑了。¤He shouted while running away in a huff.
师父！师父！有人砸场子！¤Master! Master! Someone is challenging us!
前面第一个摊位上那本{color=#d0380a}聚气{/color}倒是挺适合你的。学会积攒灵气灵活调度，再遇上沂山派至少不会落得一身伤了。¤The {color=#d0380a}Qi Gathering{/color} in the first booth is suitable enough for you. Learn to accumulate Qi and be flexible, so at very least you won’t get hurt when you meet members of the Mt. Yi Sect.
喂，魏老头，你不总吹自己见多识广，快帮我挑几件厉害的宝贝呗？¤Hey, old man Wei, you're always bragging about how knowledgeable you are, so why don't you help me pick out some great treasures?
这种低阶修士的集会你还想指望淘到啥宝贝。再说了，就算真有什么好东西，你能买得起么？¤What kind of treasure do you expect to find in this kind of low-level cultivator gathering. Besides, even if there are treasures here, could you afford it?
顺着人群，你信步来到坊市，广场周围早已摆起了不少的货摊，修士们三两成群，围在各个摊位前讨价还价，熙熙攘攘，好不热闹。¤Following the crowd you walk to the marketplace, where many stalls have already been set up around the square, cultivators are huddled in groups of two to three, and gathered in front of the stalls to haggle over their wares.
还没到集会开始的日子，坊市里空荡荡的。¤The day before the start of the rally, the square is empty.
（这阵法对我的压制作用是有些强，而且五行灵气的浓度已经是低到难以吸收利用的程度了，得想办法与炎萧{$ChenHao}配合一番快速解决战斗。）¤(This formation on my suppression is somewhat strong, and the concentration of the five elements of spiritual energy is already low to the extent that it is difficult to absorb and use, have to find a way to cooperate with Yan Xiao {$ChenHao} some quick solution to the battle.)
过去看看吧。¤Go over and take a look.
像是坚定了什么想法似的，那三个元婴期魔修见到你不但没有逃跑，反而是疯了一般再无保留地全力用各色玄紫色神通轰杀炎萧。¤Like a firm idea like what, the three YuanYing stage evil cultivators see you not only did not escape, but is crazy general again without reservation full force with various colors Xuan purple divine ability to blast Yan Xiao.
（其中应该是各种灵气稀薄，反倒是魔气弥漫。若是贸然闯入其中却又不能快速解决其中魔修，只怕事情会非常棘手。）¤(Which should be a variety of spiritual energy is thin, but instead of the demonic energy pervasive. If you barge into it but can't quickly solve the evil cultivator, I'm afraid things will be very tricky.)
其中被围攻的修士果然是离火门的炎萧。¤One of the besieged cultivators is really Yan Xiao of the Heavenly Fire Gate.
这里怎会有魔气？¤Why is there a demonic aura here?
（这阵法还算有点意思，以魔气为基压制其中的五行灵气，非魔道修士在其中战斗只会如陷泥沼，挣扎越强，陷入越深，久而久之还得面对灵气枯竭的绝境。反倒是设阵者可以利用源源不断的魔气愈战愈强。）¤(This formation is still a bit interesting, to the base of the magic gas to suppress the five elements of spiritual energy, non-evil cultivators in which the battle will only be like a quagmire, the stronger the struggle, the deeper the plunge, and in the long run have to face the desperate situation of spiritual gas depletion. (On the contrary, the person who sets up the formation can use the constant stream of magic qi to get stronger and stronger.)
炎萧见状也是大笑一声，像是要出一口被围攻的恶气一般，主动放弃闪躲转而选择全力强攻。¤Yan Xiao saw the situation is also a big smile, as if to get out a mouthful of bad gas being besieged general, take the initiative to give up dodging turned to choose the full force of a strong attack.
在看那阵法中心处，一道浴火的身影与三抹快与阵法内的玄紫色魔气融为一体的看不真切的诡影正斗得正酣。¤In looking at the center of that formation, a figure bathing in fire and three smears of unseen tricky shadows that are fast fusing with the xuan purple magic qi within the formation are fighting it out.
你对阵法稍作评论后，看准方位便是几道灵气飞掠而去。¤After you make a slight comment on the formation, look at the right direction is a few aura swept away.
（这魔气墙好像是什么独特阵法的一部分，目前仅能看出是以困为主，只是不但能困住修士，甚至对灵气也有较强的限制作用。）¤(This wall of demonic qi seems to be part of some unique formation, which can only be seen to be mainly trapping, but not only can it trap cultivators, but even has a strong restrictive effect on aura.)
（果然不出我所料，这阵法内五行灵气的浓度已经是低到难以吸收利用的程度了，得想办法与炎萧{$ChenHao}配合一番快速解决战斗。）¤(It is true that I did not expect, this formation within the concentration of five elements of spiritual energy is already low to the extent that it is difficult to absorb the use of the degree, have to find a way to work with Yan Xiao {$ChenHao} some quick solution to the battle.)
离魔气的源头应该是不远了，而这几分特别的火灵气还是难以察觉，看来正主是被什么阵法困住了难以脱身。¤It should not be far from the source of the demonic qi, and these special fire spirit qi is still hard to detect, it seems that the right person is trapped by some formation that is difficult to get out.
你并未在意这些全无生气的躯壳，只是将目光投向相斗的两方修士。¤You did not care about these completely lifeless husks, but only cast your eyes on the two cultivators fighting each other.
来的不知是哪方魔修，但此行的确是下了些本钱。¤I don't know which side of the evil cultivator is coming, but this trip is indeed under some capital.
那酝酿着攻击向你踏空而来的两个魔修还未与你交上手，便听身后的同门已是招架不住大声呼救。其中一人只好赶忙回救，仅留一个女性魔修与你对峙。¤The two evil cultivators who brewed the attack and came to you in the air had not yet exchanged hands with you, they heard the fellow disciples behind them were unable to resist and cried out for help. One of them had to rush back to save, leaving only a female evil cultivator to confront you.
这魔气浓度真是令人咂舌，比起天魔眼外围的核心区也是不遑多让。¤The concentration of this demonic energy is really smacking, compared to the core area on the periphery of the Heavenly Demon Eye.
见你破开阵法，三个魔修都是迟疑了片刻，而后都像是疯了一般再无保留地全力用各种神通轰杀炎萧。¤Seeing you break open the formation, the three evil cultivators are hesitant for a moment, and then all like crazy again without reservation to blast Yan Xiao with all kinds of divine abilities.
但后者也是战斗经验丰富，知道自己只要再撑上片刻便能迎来你的援助，不再尝试反击，大笑一声后开始一味地躲闪可能会令其重伤或是致命的攻击。¤But the latter is also experienced in combat, know that they only need to hold on for a few moments will be able to usher in your assistance, no longer try to counterattack, after a big smile and began to dodge may cause serious injuries or fatal attacks.
嗯，炎萧{$ChenHao}前些日子有事前往天魔眼，而后应是往{color=#d0380a}雷鸣海域{/color}方向去了，目前应该在{color=#d0380a}东南方{/color}¤Well, Yan Xiao {$ChenHao} had something to go to the Heavenly Demon Eye some days ago, and after that should be heading in the {color=#d0380a} Thunder Sea {/color} direction, and should currently be in the {color=#d0380a} southeast {/color}
魔气...还夹杂着些许火灵气，探测不到战斗发生的地点，却能感受到战斗带来的灵气变化。至少是元婴巅峰的战斗，看来炎萧{$ChenHu}确实有可能在这片海域，只是可能遇上了一点麻烦。¤Devilish Qi... Also mixed with a little fire aura, can not detect where the battle took place, but can feel the change in aura brought about by the battle. At least the battle at the peak of the YuanYing, it seems that Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} may indeed be in this sea, just may have encountered a little trouble.
不管来多少次，这片海域都还是一模一样。¤No matter how many times you come, this sea is still exactly the same.
当然，也有修士点缀其中，或乘灵舟，或御器飞行，也不乏体修亦或是实力强大者仅凭肉身和半丈护体灵气横渡海域。¤Of course, there are also cultivators dotted among them, or take the spirit boat, or the imperial weapon flight, there is no lack of body cultivation or strong people only with physical body and half zhang body protection aura across the sea.
只见他以一敌三却是越战越勇。那道浴火的身影仗着身法精妙，总是能躲过魔修大多数攻击，只是腰口有一道深可见骨的伤痕，但看着也没太拖累着他。¤Just see him with one against three but the more courageous the battle. The fire-bathed figure with a subtle body technique, always able to dodge most of the attacks of the evil cultivator, only the waist mouth has a bone-deep wound, but looked not too dragged him.
你的到来让几个魔修心神一动，那最外围的一个直接便转而像你发动起了攻击。¤Your arrival made several evil cultivators' hearts and minds move, and the outermost one directly turned to attack like you.
随着对敌人数的减少，炎萧顿时感觉压力全无，大笑一声后，竟是转守为攻，狂暴的火属性神通一时间让剩下的两个魔修有些措手不及，都吃了些小亏后才勉强稳住局面。¤With the reduction in the number of opponents, Yan Xiao suddenly felt the pressure is all gone, after a loud laugh, actually turned defense to attack, the rampant fire attribute aptitude for a time so that the remaining two evil cultivators are somewhat caught off guard, all ate some small losses before barely stabilizing the situation.
随着兽骸与风浪飞速退去，周遭的魔气也是愈发浓烈。除此之外，还有几分炽灼的气息隐藏于中。¤With the beast skeletons and wind waves flying away, the surrounding demonic gas is also becoming more and more intense. In addition, there are a few blazing breath hidden in the.
阵法中心处，本与一道浴火身影缠斗在一处的三抹玄紫色诡影听到你的自言自语后，先是一滞，而后皆是满脸惊惧之色。¤The center of the formation, originally with a fire figure tangled in a place of the three purple shadow heard you talking to yourself, first stalled, and then are full of fear.
料想离魔气的源头应该是不会太远了，正主若真是炎萧{$ChenHu}和某路魔道，怕是少不了一战了。¤It is expected that the source of the devilish gas should not be too far away, and if the rightful owner is really Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} and a certain way devilish path, I am afraid that there will be less of a battle.
只见他以一敌三却是越战越勇。那道浴火的身影仗着身法精妙，总是能躲过魔修大多数攻击，只是腰口有一道深可见骨的伤痕，但看着也没太拖累着他。倒是炎萧偶尔寻得一丝空隙便是全力反扑，强大的爆发力倒让那些魔修有些畏惧，一反压制性的打法，变得每每攻击时还留着三分谨慎。其中最弱的一位甚至在吃了几次小亏后转到战斗外围改用神通进行远程骚扰。¤Just see him to one against three is more and more courageous. The fire-bathed figure with a subtle body technique, always able to dodge most of the attacks of the evil cultivator, but the waist has a deep bone-shattering wound, but it did not slow him down too much. Instead, Yan Xiao occasionally found a gap is a full counterattack, powerful explosive force but let those evil cultivators some fear, a reverse of the repressive method of fighting, become every attack also left three points of caution. One of the weakest even after eating a few small losses to the periphery of the battle to use the Avatar for long-range harassment.
（况且，虽说被困的修士也是专精火系，但我也不能肯定他便是炎萧{$ChenHu}，也许先坐观其变更好？）¤(Moreover, although the trapped cultivator is also specializing in fire, but I am not sure he is Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}, perhaps first sit back and watch its change for the better?)
那被围攻的身影即便以一敌三也是越战越勇，只见他仗着身法精妙总能躲过大多数攻击，令三个魔修深觉棘手，只是腰口有一道深可见骨的伤痕，但看着也没太拖累着他。¤The besieged figure even with one against three is more and more courageous, only to see him rely on the subtlety of the body always able to dodge most of the attacks, so that the three evil cultivators feel deeply tricky, only the waist mouth has a bone-deep wounds, but look not too dragged him.
（况且，虽说被困的修士也是专精火系，但我也不能肯定他便是炎萧{$ChenHao}，也许先坐观其变更好？）¤(Moreover, although the trapped cultivator is also specialized in fire, but I am not sure he is Yan Xiao {$ChenHao}, perhaps first sit and watch its change?)
再前行一段时间，“景色”终于有些不同。¤A little further on, the 'view' is finally a little different.
初一闯入阵法便像是冲入泥沼一般，竟连你这元婴修士也有些感觉行动受制。不过在灵气护罩的效用下，倒也很快就习惯了。¤The first time I broke into the formation is like rushing into a quagmire, even you, a YuanYing cultivator also feel some action restrictions. But under the effect of the aura shield, but also quickly get used to it.
除却满溢着魔气的海水外，一面横截水天的玄紫色魔气墙突兀地出现在你眼前。¤In addition to the seawater overflowing with magic qi, a wall of xuan-violet magic qi that cut across the water and sky suddenly appeared in front of you.
这阵法果然不出我所料，对寻常修士确实有些压制的作用，但对化神修士来说，只会有些不适感而已。¤The formation is just as I expected, it does have a suppressive effect on ordinary cultivators, but to a Deity Transformation cultivator, there will only be some discomfort.
（若是不出我所料，要破这阵法易如反掌。）¤(If I do not expect, to break this formation is as easy as a hand.)
仔细思考后，本着不管被困修士是否是炎萧，坏了魔修的好事总归有意义的念头，再加上对自己实力有足够的自信，你决定闯入阵法。¤After careful consideration, in the spirit of whether or not the trapped cultivator is Yan Xiao, evil cultivator is always meaningful thoughts, coupled with enough confidence in their own strength, you decided to break into the formation.
哼，区区元婴期魔修，安敢在此造次！¤Hmph, a mere YuanYing stage evil cultivator, an dare to make a scene here!
又前行一段时间后，随之愈盛的魔气甚至令空间都有一种令人厌恶的黏着感，再加上迅速昏暗下来的视野，仿若连光线都因之停滞。但炽灼的气息却没有同时增强，还是在魔气中若隐若现，难以察觉。¤After walking for some time, the demonic aura that grew stronger even made the space have a disgusting sticky feeling, coupled with the rapidly dimmed vision, as if even the light was stalled by it. But the burning aura did not increase at the same time, still in the magical aura is hidden, difficult to detect.
{$NpcName}{$DaoYou}，炎萧{$ChenHu}不在宗门么？¤{$NpcName}{$DaoYou}, Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} is not in the clan?
几声惨叫也是因之而起，随后魔气墙也是逐渐淡化化为普通的魔气重归天地，而后几具全无生气的躯壳落入海中，溅起数朵水花后再无声息。¤A few screams are also due to it, and then the wall of magic gas is also gradually faded into ordinary magic gas back to heaven and earth, and then a few completely lifeless shells fall into the sea, splashing several splashes of water after no sound.
初一闯入阵法便像是冲入泥沼一般，粘稠到无形却有质的玄紫色魔气令你这金丹修士竟有些难以行动。还好驱动灵气护罩后算是能正常行动。¤The first time I broke into the formation it was like rushing into a quagmire, sticky to invisible but qualitative xuan purple magic Qi makes it a little difficult for you to move as a jindan cultivator. Fortunately, after driving the aura shield is able to move normally.
透过这魔气墙，一个浑身浴火的身影依稀可见，却不知是在被何人围攻，令他不得不在小范围内不断闪躲腾挪。¤Through this wall of demonic energy, a figure bathed in fire is vaguely visible, but I do not know who is besieging him, so he has to keep dodging and moving in a small area.
嗯，之前在海外遇见白帝，让我前往天魔眼调查一番。但登门造访玄道宗后，他们老祖不在门内，长老又不能越权放我进天魔眼。只是最后提到炎萧{$ChenHao}此前到访过天魔眼，让我先向他询问一番其中核心区是否有异象发生。¤Well, before meeting the White Emperor overseas, let me go to the Heavenly Demon Eye to investigate something. But after visiting the Mystic Dao Sect, their old ancestor was not in the door, and the elders could not overstep their authority to let me into the Heavenly Demon Eye. The last thing I mentioned was that Yan Xiao {$ChenHao} had previously visited the Heavenly Demon Eye and asked me to ask him first if there were any visions happening in the core area of it.
随着受害风浪飞速退去，周遭的魔气也是愈发浓烈。除此之外，炽灼的气息也是一并升腾。¤With the victimization of the wind and waves receding rapidly, the surrounding demonic energy is also becoming more and more intense. In addition, the burning breath is also rising together.
更不用说这人还偶尔能寻得一丝空隙，全力反扑一番，强大的爆发力反倒是令那些魔修畏惧不已，一反压制性的打法，变得每每攻击时还留着三分谨慎，其中最弱的一个甚至在吃了几次小亏后转到战斗外围改用神通进行远程骚扰。¤Not to mention that this person can occasionally find a gap, the full force of a counterattack, a powerful burst of power is to make those evil cultivators fearful, a reversal of the oppressive fight, become every attack also left three points of caution, one of the weakest even after a few small losses turned to the periphery of the battle to use divine powers for long-range harassment.
总之，先去魔气的源头探查一番再说吧。¤Anyway, let's go to the source of the demonic energy and explore it first.
面对如此广袤的一片海域，但肉眼之所及，神识之所至，却只有惊涛迭起的深蓝大海。既不见海兽，亦难寻修士，倒是有两者的残躯飘扬在怒涛之上，静默地承受着夹杂魔气的灼热不祥灵气中。¤Faced with such a vast piece of sea, but the naked eye, but the soul sense of the reach, but only the deep blue sea with waves. Neither see sea beasts, but also difficult to find cultivators, but there are two remnants of the body floating on top of the angry waves, silently withstanding the burning ominous aura mixed with magic.
你步入阵法后只觉举手投足之间有些微的束缚感，但也没太过在意。¤You stepped into the formation and only felt a slight sense of restraint between your hands and feet, but didn't care too much.
据之前的消息，炎萧{$ChenHu}貌似就在这片海域，这异象与他有关？而且这些尸骸...难道说...他从天魔眼出来后不知何故引来了魔修或是魔物？¤According to previous news, Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} seems to be in this sea, this vision is related to him? And these corpses... Does it mean... He came out of the Heavenly Demon Eye somehow attracted evil cultivators or demonic creatures?
仔细思考后，本着不管被困修士是否是炎萧，坏了魔修的好事总归有意义，甚至可能捞到些好处的念头，再加上对自己实力有足够的自信，你决定闯入阵法。¤After careful consideration, in the spirit of whether the trapped cultivator is Yan Xiao, evil cultivator is always meaningful, and may even fetch some benefits of the idea, coupled with enough confidence in their own strength, you decided to break into the formation.
倒是炎萧偶尔寻得一丝空隙便是全力反扑，强大的爆发力倒让那些魔修有些畏惧，一反压制性的打法，变得每每攻击时还留着三分谨慎。其中最弱的一位甚至在吃了几次小亏后转到战斗外围改用神通进行远程骚扰。¤Yan Xiao occasionally found a gap is a full-force counterattack, powerful explosive force but let those evil cultivators some fear, a reverse of the oppressive fight, become every attack also left three points of caution. One of the weakest even after a few small losses turned to the periphery of the battle to use the Avatar for long-range harassment.
面对如此广袤的一片海域，但肉眼之所及，神识之所至，却只有惊涛迭起的深蓝大海。既不见海兽，亦难寻修士，倒是有两者的残躯飘扬在怒涛之上，静默地承受着夹杂魔气的不祥灵气之侵蚀。¤Faced with such a vast area of the sea, but the naked eye, the soul sense of the reach, but only the deep blue sea with waves. Neither see the sea beasts, nor hard to find cultivators, but there are two remnants of the body floating on the angry waves, silently withstanding the erosion of the ominous aura mixed with demonic energy.
魔气！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Devilish Qi! {vpunch=10,0.5}
你的到来让几个魔修心神一动，马上便快速分出两人像是要快速解决你，而后再借助阵法慢慢耗死炎萧。¤Your arrival made several evil cultivators' hearts and minds move, and immediately they quickly divided two people like they wanted to quickly solve you, and then slowly consume Yan Xiao with the help of the formation.
但，此次稍有不同。不，若是气感敏锐些，该说是大有不同才对。¤But, this time is slightly different.
找他有事？¤What do you want from him?
你皱了皱眉头，但想到布阵者乃是魔修，也只是叹了口气开始观察相斗的两方修士。¤You frowned, but thinking that the person who set up the formation was a evil cultivator, you just sighed and started to observe the two cultivators fighting each other.
纵是高阶修仙者也难究其底的深蓝之海，充斥天地的不祥灵气，随波潜伏的狂躁海兽，三者组成了海域的主体。¤The deep blue sea, which is difficult for high-level immortals to investigate the bottom, is filled with the ominous aura of heaven and earth, and the manic sea beasts that lurk with the waves, all three make up the main body of the sea.
见你破开阵法，魔修也是迅速分出两人。似乎是觉得你最多是阵法修为不俗，战斗能力不过一般，想要迅速解决你再慢慢耗死炎萧。¤See you break open the formation, the evil cultivator is also quickly divided into two people. Seems to think that you are at most formation cultivation is not bad, combat ability but general, want to quickly solve you and then slowly consume Yan Xiao dead.
炎萧{$ChenHao}小心，我来援助你了！¤Yan Xiao {$ChenHao} careful, I'm coming to your aid!
多谢提醒。¤Thanks for the reminder.
不过几个呼吸间，未等魔修对炎萧造成实质伤害，你已是出手！¤But a few breaths, not waiting for the evil cultivator to cause substantial damage to Yan Xiao, you are already out of hand!
但炎萧{$ChenHao}所在之处凶险异常，{color=#d0380a}最好准备充分再前往{/color}。¤But the place where Yan Xiao {$ChenHao} is located is extremely dangerous, {color=#d0380a} it is best to be well prepared before you go {/color}.
（只是这雷鸣海中的稀薄魔气不足以支撑该阵法，魔气又不像五行灵气达到均衡后可以自行相生，达到生生不息的效果。想要维持该阵法，应当是在阵基上下足了功夫而已。）¤(Just the thin magic Qi in the Thunder Sea is not enough to support the formation, and the magic Qi is not like the five elements of spiritual Qi to reach equilibrium can be self-generated, to achieve the effect of endless life. (Want to maintain the formation, should be in the formation base up and down enough effort only.)
速速离去...莫要...侵扰本座修行...¤Quickly leave... Don't... Disturb my practice...
汝...应也属一方强者...本座...无意与汝争斗...¤You... You should be one of the strongest... I... I have no intention of fighting with you...
人类...？¤Human...?
区区...{$jingjie}...也敢侵扰本座修行？¤A mere... {$jingjie}... How dare you disturb my cultivation?
似乎有什么东西正盯着你...¤It seems that something is staring at you...
此处似乎就是上古龙宫，要进去吗？¤This seems to be the Ancient Dragon Palace, do you want to go in?
还是先去救人比较重要。¤It's more important to save people first.
这里就是敖灵所说的遗迹了吧。¤This is what Ao Ling said about the ruins.
你并没有在意码头那些交头接耳的修士，大步流星地向城内走去。¤You didn't care about those cross-eyed cultivators at the pier, striding towards the city.
你认为自己的实力已无需忌惮千流岛，于你而言，打败他们不过是举手之劳。¤You think your strength no longer needs to be afraid of the Thousand Streams Island, as far as you are concerned, defeating them is just a matter of hand.
我好像没有修习过隐匿身形的功法...¤I don't seem to have practiced the technique of concealing my body...
你收敛起息，悄无声息地溜进了千流岛。¤You gathered your breath and slipped silently into the Thousand Streams Island.
{w}{w=0.5}你想起先前逃离圣地时惹出的事端，恐怕明目张胆地进岛会引来岛上势力的注意，你决定...¤You remembered the trouble you caused when you escaped from the Holy Land, and you were afraid that entering the island openly would attract the attention of the island's forces.
千流岛目前恐怕已经一片混乱，我也没什么再到这里的必要了。¤I'm afraid the Thousand Streams Island is already in chaos, and there's no need for me to be here anymore.
但这租金……要是闭关个几年，那真是心疼啊……¤But the rent... If you stay in seclusion for even just a few years, it really hurts...
看不出你这{xiaozi}还挺守信的，那就自己闭关时多留几个心眼，别错过了时日。¤I see,{xiaozi} you want to honor your promise, just be mindful of how long you cultivate when you go into seclusion, and don't miss the appointed date.
聚灵阵是一种用灵石布下的基础阵法，可以慢慢地将周天的灵气汇聚集中起来，放在老夫当年，可都是修真门派才有这样的手笔。¤The Spirit Gathering Formation is a basic formation laid down with spirit stones, it slowly gathers and concentrates the spiritual energy of heaven, back in my days, only a cultivation sect had the skills necessary to set these up.
舍不得身外之物，还想逆天改命觅长生？如此条件在这东石谷已经很难得了，快去租个客房试试，看看修炼效果如何。¤You would begrudge these trivial worldly possessions? And you still think you have what it takes to defy destiny to obtain immortality? Conditions such as these are hard to come by in East Stone Valley. Go, rent a guest room and see the benefits of cultivation for yourself.
单击右下角{color=#d0380a}客房{/color}进行租住，或单击左侧{color=#d0380a}角色列表{/color}中客栈掌柜进行交互。¤Click on {color=#d0380a}Room{/color} in the bottom right corner to rent, or click on the innkeeper in the {color=#d0380a}character list{/color} on the left to interact.
可我这一闭关，万一错过了{color=#d0380a}下个月{/color}和倪兄弟的约定，岂不误事？¤But in my seclusion, I might miss out on Brother Ni's agreement {color=#d0380a}next month{/color}, wouldn't that be a mistake?
对于修真者来说，在一个灵气充裕的地方{color=#d0380a}闭关{/color}修炼，是可以事半功倍的。¤For a cultivator, {color=#d0380a}Seclusion{/color} training in a place with abundant spiritual energy can get one twice the result for half the effort.
聚灵阵？那是什么？¤Spirit gathering formation? What is that?
有意思，这客栈里还布下了一个小型的聚灵阵。¤Well well, there seems to be a small Spirit gathering formation in this inn.
慢步走进客栈，没有想象中的喧闹，大厅之中只有几位修士在悠闲地喝着灵茶，稍一运气，只觉一股浓郁的灵气扑面而来，你精神一振，顿时神清气爽。¤You slowly walk into the inn, the place is not as busy as you had imagined, there are only a few cultivators in the lobby leisurely sipping their spiritual tea. With a little luck, you feel a strong spiritual qi wash over you, lifting your spirit, and you are immediately refreshed.
不过老夫记得你那小兄弟说过，自己是{color=#d0380a}武陵城{/color}中之人。去那里说不定还能找到他。¤But the old man remembers that your little brother said that he is a member of {color=#d0380a}Wuling City{/color}. Maybe you can find him there.
修真无日月，若是有{color=#d0380a}重要的事情{/color}要办，还是得在闭关时多留些心眼。¤Cultivation has no sun and moon. If there are {color=#d0380a}important things{/color} to do, you still have to pay more attention to the retreat.
糟糕，这次闭关的时间太久，这下可错过了和倪兄弟约定的时间了！¤Oops, the retreat is too long this time, I missed the time agreed with Brother Ni!
倪兄弟还在等我呢，现在可不是闭关修炼的时候...¤Brother Ni is still waiting for me. This is not the time to close down and cultivate...
不知管家可知百里兄去向？¤I wonder if the butler knows where Brother Baili is going?
管事言辞间神色闪躲，大抵是有什么事瞒着你。¤The steward looks evasive in his words, probably because something is hiding from you.
可前往化龙海域少说也要一年半载，百里奇此时还能去哪呢？¤It takes less than a year and a half to go to Dragonborn Sea. Where else can Bailiqi go at this time?
你决定去百里奇的房间探查一番，看看能否找到什么线索。¤You decide to go to Baric's room and explore it to see if you can find any clues.
仙长莫不是拿我说笑吧？我在百里府干了许多年，还未听说过有甚么秘境。¤Isn't the immortal long making fun of me? I have worked in Baili Mansion for many years, and I haven't heard of any secrets.
他回答完你的问题，便匆匆地去忙手上的事务了。¤After he answered your question, he hurried to his business.
少主应该是出府历练了，家主或许会比较清楚吧。¤The young master should have gone out of the house for experience. The Master may be more clear about it.
你刚离开大厅，便看见百里府的管家形色匆匆的走过，你连忙叫住了他...¤As soon as you left the main hall, you saw the steward of Baili Mansion walking by in a hurry, and you quickly stopped him...
仙长何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤What's the matter with the immortal? {w}{w=0.5}
看来百里奇断然不是像百里邑所说，前往族中秘境历练。¤It seems that Bailiqi is definitely not going to the secret realm of the clan to experience as Bailiyi said.
你决定先向百里府众人打听一下百里奇的去向。¤You decided to inquire about the whereabouts of Baili Qi from the people of Baili House first.
你敏锐地察觉到此事定有蹊跷，说不定与龙珠有关。¤You are keenly aware that there must be something fishy about this matter, perhaps related to the Dragon Pearl.
你正疑惑之际，身旁恰巧路过一位百里家小厮。¤As you are wondering, you happen to pass by a Baili family boy.
不好意思，你可知你们少主如今人在何处？¤Excuse me, do you know where your young master is now?
那小厮面有难色，支吾了半天才憋出来一句话，告诉你百里奇历练去后便飞快地消失在了院中。¤The boy had a difficult look on his face, stammered for half a day before stifling a sentence, told you that Baili Qi went on a training trip and then quickly disappeared in the courtyard.
奇怪，百里兄并不像是失信之人，可他不在家中又去了哪里呢？¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're doing.
你轻轻地叩了叩门，房间里无人应答。¤You gently knocked on the door, no one answered in the room.
房间的门紧闭着，你选择...¤The door of the room was closed tightly, and you chose...
你的神识并不够强大，贸然探查可能会引起府内之人的注意，还是想想其他办法吧...¤Your soul sense is not strong enough, rashly probing may attract the attention of the people in the house, or think of other ways ...
你并未修习敛息的功法，贸然探查可能会引起府内之人的注意，还是想想其他办法吧...¤You have not practiced the technique of astringent breath, rashly probe may attract the attention of the people in the house, think of other ways...
一阵天旋地转过后，你来到了一个与方才截然不同的地方。¤After a spiral, you came to a place that was very different from the previous one.
那阵法刻在一只珐琅多宝瓶底，你思虑片刻最后果决地触发了它。¤The formation is carved into the bottom of an enamel vase, and you think for a moment before decisively triggering it.
你决定趁周围没人偷偷地溜进屋子，找到刚才令你注意的阵法。¤You decided to sneak into the house when no one was around and find the formation that had just drawn your attention.
屋子里像是有什么阵法......¤The house looks like there is some kind of formation ......
你用神识仔细地扫过屋子的每个角落，一处奇异的灵力波动吸引了你的注意。¤You use your soul sense to carefully sweep through every corner of the house, a strange spiritual energy fluctuations attracted your attention.
你且去看看那桌子上摆的多宝瓶，我感觉这东西有些古怪。¤You and go to see the table on the multi-bottle, I feel that this thing some strange.
你凑上前去，只觉得这掐丝珐琅多宝瓶华美异常，拿在手中也颇有分量。¤You go up to it and feel that the silk enamel vase is gorgeous and has a lot of weight in your hand.
将瓶外检查一遍后你举起瓶子，侧头向瓶内望去，只见一方小巧繁复的阵法在瓶底熠熠生辉。¤After examining the outside of the bottle, you lift it up and look sideways into the bottle, only to see a small and complex formation glittering at the bottom.
你思虑片刻最后果决地触发了它，一阵天旋地转过后，你来到了一个与方才截然不同的地方。¤You think about it for a moment and finally trigger it decisively, and after a moment of spinning, you come to a very different place than before.
屋子十分整洁，看起来刚刚被打扫过。¤The house is very tidy and looks like it has just been cleaned.
房间的门紧闭着...¤The door of the room is closed tightly...
还是先向百里家主打听一下吧...¤It's better to inquire with the Baili family head first...
浓雾渐起...¤The fog is rising...
你与倪旭欣自南崖城出发抵达图南海后，纵是知道图南漩涡的大致方位，也还是在这片海域里白白寻觅了数年。乃至你已经多次怀疑这碎星商会情报的真实性。¤After leaving South Cliff City with Ni XuXin, you arrived at South Tu Sea. Even though you roughly knew the location of the South Tu Whirlpool, you still searched in this sea area for several years. You have even doubted the authenticity of the intelligence from the Shattered Star Merchant Guild several times.
前有天机阁，现在又是碎星商会，情报还真是不靠谱。¤Before there was the Heavenly Chance Pavilion, and now the Broken Star Merchant Guild, intelligence is really unreliable.
哦，其实也没那么奇怪，刚从广陵城出海时，倪旭欣还觉得无尽之海的一切都很新奇，与陆地上完全不同的海上妖兽，危险但陆地难见的灵气乱流，满是修士的海上交易岛屿等。¤Oh, in fact, it is not so strange, just from Guangling City out of the sea, Ni XuXin still feel that everything in the endless sea is very new, and completely different from the land on the sea Spirit Beasts, dangerous but land is difficult to see the aura turbulence, full of cultivators of the sea trading islands, etc..
出奇地，倪旭欣没有附和你。¤Surprisingly, Ni XuXin did not attach you.
所以，倪旭欣为了给自己找点乐子，已然开始在灵舟上钓鱼。只是以灵舟的速度，普通的鱼甚至来不及反应更不用说咬钩了。¤So, Ni XuXin in order to find some fun for themselves, has started fishing in the spirit boat. But with the speed of the spirit boat, ordinary fish can't even react in time let alone bite the hook.
但一段时间后，尤其是在图南海花了大量时间寻找图南漩涡后，倪旭欣再也不能忍受枯燥的无尽之海了。在宁州时，以他元婴期的修为御剑甚至能在数天内从武陵城飞到隔壁衡州，在这海上却动不动就是数月甚至数年只能见到狂暴无匹的灵气和亘古不变的水天相接。¤However, after spending a considerable amount of time searching for the South Tu Whirlpool in the South Tu Sea, Ni XuXin could no longer endure the dullness of the endless sea. In Ning Province, with his Nascent soul stage cultivation, he could travel from Wuling City to the neighboring Heng Province in just a few days by sword, but on the sea, he could only see the unchanging sight of water and sky, sometimes for months or even years.
就在你腹诽倪旭欣独特的钓鱼方式时，留意到灵舟周近的灵气变得浓郁了起来，像是在靠近一股极为强大的灵气乱流。但，似乎又有些不同。¤Just when you are sarcastic about Ni XuXin's unique way of fishing, you notice that the aura around the boat has become thicker, like it is near an extremely powerful aura turbulence. But, it seems to be a little different.
不过只要不是以肉身在灵气乱流中停留太久，横渡普通的乱流对你和倪旭欣来说易如反掌。也就没有太放在心上。而且你感到灵气的浓郁程度虽然大幅提升了却依然保持平静，更是没有威胁力。¤But as long as you don't stay in the aura turbulence with your physical body for too long, crossing the ordinary turbulence is as easy as a handful for you and Ni XuXin. And did not put too much on the heart. And you feel that the aura's richness has increased significantly but still remains Balanced, it is not a threatening force.
（等等，灵气浓度上升如此之快却不像乱流中如此难以控制。难道，前方有一个庞大的灵气漩涡？甚至可能就是所谓的图南漩涡。）¤（Wait, the concentration of aura rises so fast but not so difficult to control like in turbulence. Could it be that there is a huge aura whirlpool ahead? It might even be the so-called South Tu Whirlpool.）
根据灵气浓度认定了方向后，你驱使着灵舟加速驶去。¤After identifying the direction according to the concentration of aura, you drive the spirit boat to speed up.
随着灵舟不断前进，“哗哗”地水声也越来越大。不多时，其声势之浩大已然如天星雨下直击海面。¤As the spirit boat kept advancing, the 'clattering' sound of water was getting louder and louder. In a short time, the sound of its momentum has been like the sky star rain directly hit the sea.
眺目以望，但见漩涡横卧水面，隔断水天；神识相探，又似冥渊仰天巨噬，仙魔难逃。\n漩之大，覆压可止千里？\n涡之深，其势堪吞阴阳！¤Overlook to look, but see the whirlpool lying across the water, separating the water and sky; soul sense to explore, and like the abyss of the sky devouring, immortal devils can not escape. \n whirlpool of the big, overlapping pressure can stop a thousand miles? \n vortex of the depth, its potential can swallow yin and yang!
啊，这就是图南漩涡么，真是大啊。¤Ah, this is the South Tu Whirlpool, really big ah.
这图南漩涡都不是元婴巅峰期修士全力一击能造成的效果，看来碎星商会让几个元婴修士带一帮金丹来此探索实在是过于鲁莽。¤This South Tu Whirlpool is not even the effect that a full-strength strike from a peak YuanYing cultivator can cause, it seems that the Broken Star Merchant Guild is too reckless to let a few YuanYing cultivators come here with a bunch of Jindans to explore.
嘿嘿，但能见识如此异象，真是不亏。反正我们是要进去的，不如就乘舟逐流，切身体会一下这漩涡的威能，如何？¤Hey, hey, but to see such a vision is really not a loss. Anyway, we are going to go in, why not take the boat and go with the flow, and experience the power of this vortex, how?
倪兄还是不要太放松比较好，毕竟这漩涡之下可是有等同于魔剑级别的存在，我们还是应当步步为营。¤Ni brother or not too relaxed better, after all, under this vortex but there is the equivalent of the existence of the magic sword level, we should still step by step.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}说得对。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} is right.
你们达成一致后，便是以神通护体，借着吸力快速向漩涡的起源前进。¤After you have reached an agreement, it is to protect your body with the divine power and quickly advance towards the origin of the vortex by the suction.
倒是偶尔有倒霉的鱼被急速飞过的鱼钩直接撞裂开来。当然，也有极少数鱼会因为各种原因而幸运的保得身躯相对完整，然后被鱼钩刺穿，在倪旭欣提竿甩钩之间被带入鱼篓，为他无聊的海上之旅添上一丝单薄的乐趣。¤Rather, there are occasionally unlucky fish were flying rapidly past the fish hooks directly into the crack. Of course, there are very few fish will be lucky for various reasons to keep the body relatively intact, and then pierced by the hook, in Ni XuXin to lift the rod between the hook was brought into the fish basket, for his boring trip to the sea to add a touch of thin fun.
重回故地，你不免想起当时与倪旭欣在这里命悬一线的经历，多少仍有些心悸。¤When you return to your old haunts, you can't help but think of the time when you and Ni XuXin's lives were hanging by a thread here, and you are still somewhat haunted.
图南海大漩涡之下隐藏着的，是蕴含天道之力的神秘古树，而那也是化神期修士都不敢与之为敌的恐怖存在。¤Hidden beneath the great whirlpool of the South China Sea is the mysterious ancient tree that contains the power of the Heavenly Dao, and that is also a terrifying existence that no cultivator at the Deity Transformation stage would dare to make an enemy of.
不知是否是你们此前的行为惊醒了沉睡多年的古树，此时图南海漩涡的恐怖更甚往日。¤I don't know if your previous actions have awakened the ancient trees that have been sleeping for many years, but at this time the horror of the vortex in the South Sea of Tu is even greater than in the past.
你的脑海中浮现出成千上万条根须在海底挥舞的场景，不由的感到头皮发麻...¤Your mind wanders to the scene of thousands of roots waving at the bottom of the sea and you can't help but feel your scalp tingling...
还是过段时间再来看看吧。¤It's better to check back in a while.
图南海的海面相比于当年似乎平静了不少，不知是否是那颗神秘的古树又重新陷入了沉睡之中。¤The sea in the South China Sea seems much calmer than it was back then, and I wonder if it is the mysterious ancient tree that has fallen back into slumber.
你想下去看看？¤You want to go down and have a look?
多少有些好奇...这海底古树能够孕育天道果这般奇物，师兄更是称它为道的化身。¤More or less curious... This ancient tree at the bottom of the sea is capable of producing such a strange thing as the Heavenly Dao Fruit, and senior brother even called it the incarnation of the Dao.
上次仅仅是一根根须，便让我和倪兄难以招架。但凭我如今修为，就算不是它的对手，想必也足以自保了吧？¤Last time, just a root whisker made it difficult for Brother Ni and me to fight. But with my current cultivation level, even if I am not a match for it, I think I will be able to defend myself, right?
依我看，三冥海之事，阁下还是少掺和为好。¤In my opinion, it is better for you to stay out of the affairs of the Three Deep Seas.
这阴阳瞳果然有用...¤This Yin Yang eye is really useful...
此事事关重大，在下断不可能收手，还请阁下指点。¤This is a matter of great importance, and it is impossible for me to stop, so I would like to ask for your guidance.
你本就受白帝所托来此寻找复活之术的线索，当下便直接飞至那魂体前，打算问些消息。¤You had been entrusted by the White Emperor to come here to find clues to the art of resurrection, so you flew straight to that soul body at that moment, intending to ask for some information.
你能听出他乃是真心劝诫，但奈何，此秘术你无论如何也要寻到。¤You can hear that he is sincere in his admonition, but no matter what, you must find this secret art no matter what.
定睛观察一番——附近的阴气都朝着不远处一座小山汇集，你便也一路寻了过去。¤Look around - all the yin energy in the vicinity is converging on a small Mountain not far away, so you go there too.
只是？¤Only?
老头儿，这里怎么阴森森的？¤Old man, why is it so eerie in here?
听到秘术的字眼，他撇了你所背的铁剑一眼，表情略微有些变化。¤At the word secret art, he glances at the iron sword you are carrying and his expression changes slightly.
你向他作了一揖，他睁开眼睛看向你，正对上你一黑一白的双目，似乎有一些惊讶。¤You make a bow to him, and he opens his eyes to look at you, meeting your black and white eyes with what seems to be some surprise.
你倒是会想，只可惜我基本无法离开这铁剑，否则就是魂飞魄散的下场。¤You can think of that, but it's just a pity that I basically can't leave this iron sword, otherwise I would end up with my soul flying away.
越是期望，便越是绝望…¤The more you expect, the more you despair...
几千年前，也有一人来此寻此秘术，只不过他背的是竹筒，你背的是剑。¤Thousands of years ago, a man also came here in search of this secret art, only he was carrying a bamboo tube and you are carrying a sword.
你的语气异常坚定。他考虑了片刻，最终还是叹了口气。¤Your tone is unusually firm. He considers this for a moment, and finally sighs.
那他…最后结局如何？¤So how did he...end up?
这莫名其妙的回答，让你有些摸不着头脑。¤That inexplicable answer leaves you a little baffled.
刚离开海岛，你便催动灵气灌入双目。¤Just after you left the island, you pushed your spiritual power into your eyes.
言尽于此，道友好自为之。¤This is all I have to say, so take care of yourself.
…何事？¤...what is it?
几千年来，三冥海上所发生的事没有一件善终，几千年前如此，几千年后也一样。¤Nothing that has happened on the Three Deep Seas has ended well for thousands of years, thousands of years ago and thousands of years later.
唉…道友若想寻得秘术，可去阴冥海北方的阴魂岛打探一番，只是…¤If you want to find the secret art, you can go to the Yin Soul Island in the northern part of Deep Yin Sea and explore it, but...
他没有明说，只是摇了摇头。¤He didn't say so explicitly, just shook his head.
一阵阴风吹过，你只觉得有什么东西在盯着你，不由自主地打了个寒颤。¤An eerie breeze blows through and you just shiver as you feel something staring at you.
那是一名通体青灰，呈半透明状的魂体，似乎正在打坐修炼。看这吸收天地阴气的架势，想必实力也是不俗。¤It was a translucent soul with a greenish-grey body, which seemed to be meditating and cultivating. Looking at the way it was absorbing the Yin Qi of heaven and earth, it must have been quite strong.
一时间，此前你只能隐隐感受到的阴气，具象成了白色的雾气，你可以清晰地看见它们的流动。¤For a moment, the yin you could only vaguely feel before materialises into a white mist, and you can clearly see its flow.
像？像什么？¤Like? Like what?
既然你能看见，那岂不是能直接与他们交流？¤Since you can see, wouldn't you be able to communicate with them directly?
道友，打扰了。在下有要事相问。¤Fellow Daoist, excuse me. I have something important to ask you.
…也罢，先去别的地方转转吧。¤...and so be it, let's go around somewhere else first.
像…太像了。¤Like...too much like.
这里…有许多依附于阴气生存的魂体。你若也是魂体，便能感应的到他们。¤Here...there are many souls that live off the Yin energy. If you are also a spirit body, you can sense them.
在下对阴冥海不尚了解，故来请教一二。不知道友可曾听说过，一种能让魂体死而复生的秘术？¤I do not know much about the Deep Yin Sea, so I have come to ask for some advice. I wonder if you have ever heard of a secret technique that can bring a soul back from the dead?
要进入阴魂岛吗？¤You want to enter the Island of the Spirits?
暂未开放¤Not yet open
你仍想在此处找到那神秘声音的来源，可惜一无所获。¤You are still trying to find the source of the mysterious voice here, but unfortunately, you can't seem to locate it.
要进入海底洞府么？¤Do you want to enter the underwater cave?
一段时间后，你仍然无法参透这阵法，只得悻悻离开。¤After some time, you are still unable to penetrate the formation and have to leave unhappily.
要上岛么？¤Want to go to the island?
是龙族，百里兄小心！¤It's the dragon, brother Baili, be careful!
突然间海上掀起一股巨浪，一只硕大的龙头从水中探出，一双巨眼紧紧地盯着你们。¤Suddenly there was a huge wave on the sea, and a huge dragon head protruded from the water, with huge eyes staring at you tightly.
哼，百里小贼还敢来化龙海？受死！¤Huh, the little thief of Baili dare to come to transform Longhai? Suffer to death!
也不知要在哪里才能发现龙族的踪...¤I don't know where to find the dragon clan...
百里兄，这里就到了龙族掌控的海域了吧。¤Brother Baili, this is the sea area controlled by the Dragon Clan.
等等，莫下重手！¤Wait, don't make a heavy hand!
人类...这股气息...莫非前些时日长老说的就是你二人？¤Human...this breath...could it be that the elder said that you are the two of you a few days ago?
不错，一般来说化龙海的龙族不会主动攻击来往的人类商队。但你和我在一起，情况定然不同。我们还是要小心行事。¤Yes, generally speaking, the dragons of Dragonborn Sea will not take the initiative to attack the human caravan. But when you are with me, the situation is definitely different. We still have to be careful.
要进入龙宫吗？¤Do you want to enter the Dragon Palace?
一道屏障将你阻挡在外。¤A barrier keeps you out.
没兴趣。¤I'm not interested.
此地人多眼杂，不如前辈随我移步附近的酒楼雅座再叙可好？我家长老已经等候您多时了。¤This place is crowded, so why don't you come with me to a nearby restaurant and have a chat? My elders have been waiting for you for a long time.
这位可是{FirstName}前辈么？我家长老想邀你来府一叙，不知前辈可愿赏脸？¤This is {FirstName} senior? I'd like to invite you to the house for a chat, I wonder if you'd be willing to show your face?
好，好，好。看来你们知道的还真不少，那我便认识认识你家长老，带路吧。¤I'm not sure if you'd like to come. It seems that you know a lot, so I'll get to know your elders and lead the way.
（看来我若要在南崖城获取更多关于图南漩涡的消息，难免用一些强硬手段，不如回港口等倪兄的消息好了。）¤（It seems that if I want to get more information about the South Tu Whirlpool in South Cliff City, I will inevitably use some strong-arm tactics, so I might as well go back to the port and wait for news from Brother Ni.）
前辈，我家长老并无恶意，只是仰慕您的修为高深，想与您结识一番，交个朋友罢了。¤Elder, my elder has no malice, he just admires your high level of cultivation and wants to get acquainted with you and make a friend.
前...前辈留步！¤Elder... Elder stay!
即便前辈修为通天，连图南海的漩涡都敢闯上一闯，难道前辈对如何突破化神也没有兴趣么？¤Even if senior's cultivation is so profound that he dares to break into the vortex of the South Tu Sea, doesn't senior have any interest in how to break through to Deity Transformation?
我在南崖城并没有认识过什么家族长老，你家长老是何人，为何派你在这客栈外监视我？¤I don't know any family elders in South Cliff City, who is your family elder and why did he send you to spy on me outside this inn?
我家长老晋入元婴多年，又精于炼丹，对于化神之突破大有研究。前辈若能与长老相谈，一定能大有收获的！¤My family's elders have been in the first generation for many years and are skilled in alchemy, so they have a lot of research on the breakthrough to Deity Transformation. If you can talk to the elder, you will be able to gain a lot!
刚离开客栈，你便隐约察觉一道微弱的神识扫过。这道神识并没有什么攻击性，但显然，是有什么人盯上了你。¤Just left the inn, you will be vaguely aware of a weak soul sense swept through. This soul sense is not offensive, but it is clear that someone is eyeing you.
来人是一名笑脸盈盈的少女，你神识扫过，发现此人不过金丹期修为，你决定...¤The visitor is a smiling young girl, you soul sense swept through, found that this person is only the jindan stage cultivation, you decided ...
眼下诸事繁多，你自然没有什么兴趣去认识一个陌生的长老。你一脸冷漠的拒绝了她，扭头便要离开。¤With so many things going on at the moment, you naturally have little interest in getting to know a strange elder. You reject her with a cold face and turn your head to leave.
最近没有开往无尽之海的仙舟。¤There are no immortal boats that sail to the Endless Sea recently.
哈哈哈，果然又有双灵根资质！¤Hahaha, sure enough, another double spiritual root qualification!
怎么样，要不要第一个上台挑战一下？¤How about it, do you want to be the first to challenge it?
那擂台之上的可是真正修习过竹山宗功法的外门弟子，又岂是寻常的散修能够战胜的。那些灵根资质稍差，却又能让我派破格收入门内的，自然要有自己的独到之处才行。¤The ones on the ring are outside disciples who have truly practiced Bamboo Mountain Sect's techniques, so how can they be defeated by ordinary independent cultivators? The fact that those who are less qualified in terms of spiritual roots, but can be admitted to our sect, naturally must have their own unique specialty.
剩下的人只要能通过我们擂台的比试，一样可以成为我们竹山宗的外门弟子。今天的比试就由本门的首席弟子，李师兄来为大家主持。¤Alright, as for the rest of you, as long as you can win a battle in the ring you will be able to join the sect as an outer disciple! Today, our chief disciple Brother Li will host the competition.
没过多久，擂台上的比试便都结束了，那些来参加比试的其他人，竟没有一个人能在擂台上获得胜利。¤It didn't take long for the competition to finish, none of those who came were able to successfully pass.
天...天灵根！¤Heavenly... Spiritual Root!!!
唉，你这次猎魔试炼的表现实在一言难尽，有损我派颜面...此后可千万要勤加修炼。¤Hey, the reality of your demon hunting trial this time is hard to explain in a word, it hurts my face... You must practice harder from now on.
两位{shidi}，久等了吧。¤Two {shidi}, wait a long time.
竟然是百年难得一遇的天灵根，大师兄，这...¤It turned out to be the once-in-a-century Heavenly Spiritual Root! Senior brother Li, this...
不说这些了，{shidi}刚入门，还有诸多事情要办。你们先带上我这块信物，去{color=#d0380a}神兵阁{/color}领取门派配属的符器和道袍，然后{color=#d0380a}再回来找我{/color}。¤Leave aside, {shidi} is just getting started, and there are still many things to do. You take my token first, and go to {color=#d0380a}Shenbing Pavilion{/color} to receive the runes and robes attached to the sect. , And then {color=#d0380a} come back and find me{/color}.
台上这群人里，也就那个叫李青麟的，资质修为还算不错。嘿，剩下的人都是稀松平常的很。¤Among the group of people on the stage, the one named Li Qinglin has a fairly good level of cultivation. Hey, the rest of the people are quite ordinary.
你走上前去，也把手放到晶石之上，和之前那次一样，晶石发出一阵明亮的光芒。¤You go forward and put your hand on the spar. Just like the previous time, the spar emits a bright light.
你一个纵身便跃上擂台¤You jumped into the ring when you jumped in.
我来！¤I come!
竟然能见到李青麟，这可是我宁州年青一代的翘楚，年纪轻轻就突破了炼气期成功筑基。¤Even to see Li Qinglin, this is the leader of my young generation in Ning Province, who broke through the Qi refining period and successfully built the foundation at a young age.
请！¤please!
你身前的那名修士听言便走上前去，把手放到晶石之上，晶石散发出一阵明亮的光芒。¤The cultivator in front of you walked forward and put their hand on the crystal. The crystal started emitting a bright light.
愿下次相见，与诸位同门相称。¤I hope to see you next time and be worthy of everyone in the same family.
各位，此次擂台守擂的正是我竹山宗的外门弟子，大家可以自行上台挑战，如果获胜的话，就能成被招入门派。¤Everyone, it is the outer disciple of my Bamboo Mountain Sect who is guarding the ring this time. You can take the challenge on your own. If you win, you will be recruited.
广场上一阵骚动，过了片刻，你和另外一人在众人妒忌的眼神中走出了人群。¤There was a commotion in the square, after awhile you and another walked out of the crowds under the jealous eyes of everyone present.
也不知他是怎么杀了那么多魔物的...居然比大师兄还多，要是我也能这么厉害就好了。¤I don't know how he killed so many monsters... actually more than the big brother, if only I could be so powerful.
是啊，若能结个善缘就更好了。¤Yeah, it would be better if we could form a good relationship.
不错，不错...你先去一旁候着，下一个！¤Not bad, not bad. Go wait on the side. Next!
你对木之道的感悟略微提升了。¤Your perception of the Tao of Wood is slightly improved.
你没有急着上场，而是先在场下观望了几场。¤You didn't rush to play, but watched a few games off the court.
还有谁想上台挑战么？¤Who else wants to challenge on stage?
哈哈哈，{shidi}有所不知，其实已经有好些年没有人能够通过外门的擂台比试加入门派了。¤Hahaha, {shidi} doesn't know, in fact, no one has been able to join the martial arts through the outer ring arena for many years.
果然是天灵根，我派已有数百年没有招收到如此资质的弟子了...¤Sure enough, it is a Heavenly Spirit Root. I have not recruited such a talented disciple in hundreds of years...
凡是天灵根和双灵根资质道友，请先站到我身边来。¤Anyone with Heavenly or Double Spiritual Roots, please come forward and stand next to me first.
两位{shidi}，你们便不必参加之后的擂台比试了，现在这里等候片刻，等比试结束，我再来找你们。¤Two {shidi}, you don’t have to take part in the next challenge. I’ll wait for a while here. When the competition is over, I will come to you again.
在下先来讨教一二！¤Let’s ask for advice first or two!
师弟，剩下的入门比试便交给你来主持了，我先带这位小{shidi}去面见掌门师尊。¤Brother, I will leave the rest of the recruitment to you. I will first take this young {shidi} to meet the sect head.
（老头儿，这守擂的人厉不厉害？）¤(Old man, is this guardian good?)
广场上一阵骚动，过了片刻，有两人在众人妒忌的眼神中走出了人群。¤There was a commotion in the square, after awhile two people walked out of the crowd under jealous eyes.
你走上前去，手刚一接触晶石，晶石便散发出刺眼的白光，比之前那人更亮上数倍。见此情景，台上台下顿时鸦雀无声。¤You step forward and as soon as your hand touches the crystal, it begins to emit a dazzling light several times brighter than the person before. Everyone on the stage quickly fell silent...
那名竹山宗的守擂弟子，一身木系功法使得颇为熟练，前几名挑战者都被他的法术{color=#d0380a}缠绕{/color}住，动弹不得，很快便败下阵来。¤That disciple of Bamboo Mountain Sect, who is quite proficient in wood-based techniques, was entangled with his spell {color=#d0380a}{/color} for the first few challengers, unable to move, and soon failed. Come down.
嗯，不错...你们两个待会儿跟着那边的师兄去宗门大殿，待长老们亲自确认过你们的灵根资质，你们就可以直接成为我派的内门弟子了。¤Well, yes...you two will follow the senior over there to the main hall of the sect in a moment, and once the elders have personally confirmed your spiritual root aptitude, you can directly become my inner disciple.
诸位道友，今天是我们竹山宗招收入门弟子的第五天，诸位既然来到了这里，请务必听清在下所讲的每一句话，这将直接关系到诸位能否进入本门。¤Fellow daoists, this is the fifth day we are recruiting disciples for our Bamboo Mountain Sect. Now that you've arrived, please listen to every word you're about to hear. This will directly influence if you're able to enter the sect or not.
你先来，把手放在晶石上，不要动。¤You come first, put your hand the crystal and don't move.
噗嗤，那个猎魔试炼杀了{$TempValue}只魔的{shidi}回来了。¤Puff, the demon hunting trial, {shidi} who killed the {$TempValue} demon, is back.
(倪兄貌似在此处打听，为了提高效率我还是去其他地方吧。）¤（Brother Ni seems to be inquiring here, for the sake of efficiency I'd better go elsewhere.）
还不如跟我一样四处游历，以寻宝为乐...¤May as well travel around with me for the pleasure of treasure hunting...
我在打听时也是多次听闻漩涡非常危险。¤I also heard many times when inquiring about the vortex is very dangerous.
不多时，倪旭欣也是来到约定的地点。¤Not much later, Ni XuXin also came to the agreed location.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}说笑了，我不过是跑了一趟腿而已，哈哈哈。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} Joking aside, I was just running an errand, hahaha.
不过，{FirstName}{xiongdi}储物袋中可有带灵石？我平时也没有身边带大量灵石的习惯，身上有的也不够交换情报。¤But, {FirstName}{xiongdi}did you bring spirit stones in your storage bag? I usually do not have the habit of carrying around a lot of spirit stones, and what I have on my body is not enough to exchange information.
你独自嗟叹间，倪旭欣已然携图南漩涡情报归来。¤You alone contemplating between, Ni XuXin has already returned with South Tu Whirlpool intelligence.
啊？啊，我刚去了趟天极殿。据他们所说，数百年前曾有许多修士自发前往图南漩涡，或探访遗迹，或寻求机缘，但无一例外失去音讯，料想应该是尽皆陨落其中。¤What? Ah, I just went to the Heavenly Extreme Hall. According to them, hundreds of years ago there were many cultivators spontaneously went to the South Tu Whirlpool, or visit the relics, or seek opportunities, but without exception lost, it is expected that they all fell.
之后三大岛也分别召集麾下修士前往漩涡探索。其中声势最为浩大的碎星商会甚至出动了多位元婴期修士，但结果依旧是无人归来，更不用说有所收获了。¤After that, the three major islands also called their cultivators to explore the vortex. One of the most powerful Shattered Star Merchant Guild even sent a number of YuanYing stage cultivators, but the result is still no one returned, not to mention the harvest.
这次真没了？¤This time there really is no?
你回到港口。但没有见到倪旭欣，估摸着只是打听漩涡的消息应该也花不了太多时间，便决定闭目养神等上他一会。¤You return to the port. But did not see Ni XuXin, guessing that just inquiring about the vortex should not take too much time, so you decided to close your eyes and wait for him for a while.
你想着自己身上的诛仙剑小声补了一句，但是倪旭欣并没有太在意¤You think about the Immortal Sword on your own body whispered a complement, but Ni XuXin did not care too much
{FirstName}{xiongdi}若无其他消息相告，那，我们便出发去图南海？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}If there is no other news to tell, then, we will set out for the Tu Nanhai?
倪旭欣似乎是还在你一连串的消息打击中未反应过来，显然是没想到在你的努力下，刚到南崖城便搜集到了如此之多的信息。¤Ni XuXin seems to be still in your series of news blow not reacted, obviously did not expect in your efforts, just arrived in South Cliff City to collect so much information.
那，这次的50万灵石，估计也...¤Then, the 500,000 spirit stones this time, it is estimated that...
哈哈哈，有{FirstName}{xiongdi}在看来我只用做好进漩涡的准备就是了，其他的都可以放心交给{xiongdi}。不如我们这就出发去...¤Hahahaha, with {FirstName}{xiongdi} in it seems that I only need to be prepared to enter the whirlpool is, the rest can be safely handed over to {xiongdi}. Why don't we just leave for...
好，没有其他消息了。¤Okay, no further news.
我刚在碎星商会打听到图南漩涡的位置便是在图南海{color=#d0380a}东南部{/color}。¤I just inquired at the Shattered Star Merchant Guild and found out that the location of the South Tu Whirlpool is in the southeast of the Tunan Sea {color=#d0380a}{/color}.
商会开价50万灵石，但我此次出来只带了5万灵石，一路上又花了些，如今不足两万灵石了，嘿嘿嘿。¤The Merchant Guild offered 500,000 spirit stones, but I came out with only 50,000 spirit stones, and spent some along the way, now less than 20,000 spirit stones, hehehehe.
我倒是得知碎星商会对于那个漩涡知道很多，只是...¤I did learn that the Shattered Star Merchant Guild knows a lot about that vortex, just...
恍惚间，你想起百年前刚遇见这阔少并从沂山派救下他时，好像还曾许诺将自己身上的法宝都送你，但...¤In a trance, you remember a hundred years ago when you just met this young man and saved him from the Mt. Yi Sect, you seem to rememember him having promised to give you all the magic treasures on his body, but...
好，好啊，本来只是想带{FirstName}{xiongdi}去找师祖，没想到反倒什么都要靠{xiongdi}了，哈哈，哈哈。¤Good, good, originally just want to take {FirstName}{xiongdi} to the master, did not expect to rely on {xiongdi} everything instead, ha, ha, ha.
不愧是{FirstName}{xiongdi}，实力强大不说，探访情报还如手到擒来。出海前拉上你真是没错哈哈哈。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} is not only strong, but brings extremely useful information. This will really help when setting out to sea hahaha, thank you {FirstName}{xiongdi}.
那我们这就出发去图南海吧。¤Then we'll leave for the South China Sea.
倪兄可有收获？¤Ni brother can have harvest?
不过也正是如此凶险，才让我更加相信这魔剑确实在漩涡中。¤But it is also so fierce, it makes me more convinced that this magic sword is indeed in the vortex.
你寻思着自己不方便出现在碎星商会，若想再说些什么，也只能以神识传音。只是以倪旭欣的速度，此时怕是已在商会内部，神识传音多半会被阵法挡住，也只能等倪旭欣回来再说了。¤You find yourself inconvenient to appear in the Broken Star Merchant Guild, if you want to say something more, you can only use soul sense to transmit voice. Just to Ni XuXin's speed, at this time is afraid of the Merchant Guild inside, soul sense voice transmission will most likely be blocked by the formation, but also can only wait for Ni XuXin back to say.
这一路紧赶慢赶，总算是到南崖城了啊，海上真是太无聊了。¤This all the way to the South Cliff City, finally arrived at the ah, the sea is really too boring.
倪兄别急，我...¤Brother Ni don't be in a hurry, I...
哈哈哈，还是倪兄厉害。¤Hahahaha, it's still Brother Ni who is great.
看来我们还得去其他地方打听一番这漩涡的位置了，不然偌大一个图南海，还不知要找到何时。¤It seems we still have to go elsewhere to inquire about the location of this vortex, otherwise a large figure of the South China Sea, do not know when to find.
至于其他信息，天极殿也只是推说现今图南漩涡被列为禁地，相关信息也是佚失。¤As for other information, the Temple of Heaven's End is only to say that now the South Tu Whirlpool is classified as a forbidden place, the relevant information is also anonymous.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}真是消息灵通，我这便去商会打听一番。¤{I will go to the Merchant Guild to inquire about it.
我现在也没有50万灵石，待我想想办法。¤I don't have 500,000 spirit stones right now either, so I'll think of something.
你回到码头，倪旭欣正在近旁等待，但见他一副沉思的样子，也不知在想什么。¤You return to the pier, Ni XuXin is waiting close by, but see him a pensive look, also do not know what is thinking.
啊不对，这次不是来闲聊的，{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我们还是分头去打听一下漩涡或其他相关危险地点的情报吧。¤Ah no, this time is not to gossip,{FirstName}{xiongdi}, we'd better split up to inquire about the intelligence of the vortex or other related dangerous locations.
或至少是同阶异宝...¤Or at least the same order of exotic treasures...
是吧，哈哈哈。所以我一直搞不懂百里家那个好斗猿人为啥喜欢往海上跑。¤Right, hahaha. So I've never been able to figure out why that belligerent ape of the Baili family likes to run to the sea.
正当你准备说自己不方便前往碎星商会打听时，倪旭欣打断了你。¤Just as you are about to say that you are not comfortable traveling to the Shattered Star Merchant Guild to inquire, Ni XuXin interrupts you.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}的意思是？¤What does {FirstName}{xiongdi} mean?
你将碎星商会幸存者及之后的事一一向倪旭欣说明。然后你们就幸存者浑浑噩噩的状态做出简单的讨论，不出意料的，倪旭欣更加坚信漩涡中有一把魔剑，而这幸存者就是煞气入体才会如此。只是不知为何不似宁州古迹中人一般，会四处伤人。¤You explain the Shattered Star Merchant Guild survivors and what happened afterwards to Ni XuXin. Then you make a brief discussion about the survivor's muddled state, and unsurprisingly, Ni XuXin is more convinced that there is a magic sword in the vortex, and that the survivor is the one who got into the body with the fury to do so. Just somehow not like the Ning Province monuments in general, will be around to hurt people.
想什么呢，准备出发了。¤What are you thinking about, ready to go.
倪兄可有打听到漩涡的位置？¤Ni brother has inquired about the location of the vortex?
你花了一点时间将知晓碎星商会幸存者及之后与之战斗时了解到的海底幻境一事向倪旭欣说明清楚。不出意料的，倪旭欣更加坚信漩涡中有一把魔剑，而这幸存者就是煞气入体才会如此。只是不知为何不似宁州古迹中人一般，会四处伤人。¤You spent a little time to know the survivors of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild and the battle with it afterwards when you learned about the underwater illusion to Ni XuXin explained clearly. Not surprisingly, Ni XuXin more convinced that there is a magic sword in the whirlpool, and this survivor is the brake into the body to do so. Just somehow not like the Ning Province monuments in general, will go around to hurt people.
说到准备，碎星商会还告诉我了一些其他消息。¤Speaking of preparation, the Broken Star Merchant Guild also told me some other news.
哈哈哈，我可没说只打听到图南漩涡有多危险。¤Hahaha, I didn't say that I only inquired about how dangerous the South Tu Whirlpool was.
五十万灵石...不愧是，倪少啊，哈，哈，哈。¤Five hundred thousand spirit stones... Not bad, Ni Shao ah, ha, ha, ha.
（只是要灵石么，倒还好。若是真到了打上门去要消息的地步，浪费时间不说，若是他们供奉齐出被缠上了还挺麻烦。）¤（Not a problem if it's only for spirit stones. But If it really comes to the point of banging the door to ask for information, not only is it a waste of time, it could get you in real trouble if all the Guest Elders come out.）
按倪兄的描述，这漩涡也算不上太难见，也许{color=#d0380a}客栈{/color}中会有人知道相关的消息，考虑此处着手吧。¤According to Brother Ni's description, this vortex is not too difficult to see, perhaps {color=#d0380a} inn {/color} in someone will know the relevant news, consider here to start it.
不愧是{FirstName}{xiongdi}，那我们接下来只要再打听清楚漩涡出现的规律就好了，希望不要等太久。¤The {FirstName}{xiongdi}, then we just need to inquire about the pattern of the vortex appearing next, and hopefully not wait too long.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，图南漩涡便是在图南海{color=#d0380a}东南部{/color}，商会的人说从过往的规律算来，近期应该会现世，我们这便出发吧。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, the South Tu Whirlpool is in the southeast of the Tunan Sea {color=#d0380a}{/color}, the people of the Merchant Guild said that from past patterns, it should appear in the near future, let's set out here.
啊不对，现在不是说这些的时候。好不容易到了南崖城，{FirstName}{xiongdi}我们还是分头去打听一下漩涡或者相关危险地点的情报吧。¤Ah no, now is not the time to say this. It's hard to get to South Cliff City, {FirstName}{xiongdi} we'd better split up and inquire about the intelligence of the vortex or related dangerous locations.
正当你打算叮嘱倪旭欣一番时，他已是踏上飞剑往城内方向疾驰而去，只留下你在原地发愣。¤When you intend to exhort Ni XuXin some, he is already stepped on the flying sword to the direction of the city sped away, leaving only you in the same place froze.
倪兄莫急。这出现规律嘛，碎星商会的人也说了，图南漩涡近期便是会现世。¤Brother Ni is not anxious. The law of appearances, the people of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild also said, South Tu Whirlpool is the recent emergence of the world.
我可不是那帮整天只会闭关论道的老顽固。他们睁眼只会论道，闭眼就是苦修，结果一晃几百年过去了，也没见得飞升。¤I'm not that bunch of old stubborn people who only close their eyes to discuss the dao. They will only open their eyes to discuss the dao, close their eyes is hard cultivation, the result of a few hundred years have passed, but did not see the ascension.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，碎星商会果然掌握了图南漩涡的情报，而且只要给够灵石就可以卖给我们！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, the Broken Star Merchant Guild really has information about the South Tu Whirlpool, and as long as you give enough spirit stones you can sell it to us!
我刚去了一趟天极殿，本以为在那可以轻易打听到相关消息，没想听到的全是漩涡怎么怎么危险...至于，位置，或者其他相关的内容，什么都没问到...¤I just went to the Heavenly Palace, I thought I could easily inquire about the news there, but I didn't want to hear all about how dangerous the vortex is... As for the location, or other related content, nothing was asked...
好说，好说。不知倪兄跟商会商量好的价格是多少？¤Good point, good point. I do not know how much price Ni brother negotiated with the Merchant Guild?
上灵舟吧，据碎星商会所言，图南漩涡近期便要重新现世了，耽误了时间可要赶不上了。¤Let's get on the spirit boat, according to the Merchant Guild, South Tu Whirlpool will reappear in the near future.
这曾经的翘家阔少并没有多想你话语间的深意，拿了灵石就急忙御剑往碎星商会去了。只留你一人在原地心疼自己的灵石。¤The former warped family young man did not think much about the deeper meaning of your words, took the spirit stones and hurriedly went to the Broken Star Merchant Guild by sword. Only you are left alone in the same place heartbroken their soul stone.
（看你去了这么久，我还以为有什么收获呢。）¤（Seeing that you have been there for so long, I thought there was something to be gained.
除此之外，我天机阁有幸获得了一些涵虚仙府的消息，届时也会一并奉上。¤In addition, my Heavens Secrets Pavilion is fortunate to have received some news about Hanxu Immortal Mansion, and will also provide it at that time.
诸位不用怀疑在下的用意。只是考虑到涵虚此人乖僻好战，当初也是连败多位公孙家修士。甚至到云汐城布阵挑衅，以至公孙家老祖当年不得不出手将之镇压。在下由此认为其洞府恐怕也是凶险异常。¤You don't have to doubt the intention of the next. Just considering that Hanxu is a perverse and combative person, he lost many Gongsun cultivators in a row at the beginning. He even went to Yunxi City to provoke and even the ancestors of the Gongsun family had to take action to suppress him. From this, I think that his cave mansion is also dangerous and unusual.
你看到其他人再次交头接耳，心中不免也对涵虚仙人的洞府多了几分遐想。但天机阁执事接下来的话语，让整个会场瞬间归于安静。¤When you see other people whispering to each other again, you can't help but think a little bit more about Hanxu Immortal's Dongfu. But the next words of deacon from Heavens Secrets Pavilion made the whole venue quiet in an instant.
诸位还请安静。虽然部分道友已经知道涵虚仙人的威名，但还请容许我给其他道友介绍一下此次拍卖物品的正主。¤Everyone, please be quiet. Although some Daoists already know the reputation of Hanxu Immortal, please allow me to introduce to other Daoists the owner of this auction item.
是不是涵虚仙府的玉佩还不好说，我可不敢在这种地方把玉佩拿出来验证一番。¤Whether it is the jade pendant of Hanxu Immortal Mansion is not easy to say, I dare not take out the jade pendant for verification in such a place.
场内变得嘈杂了起来，只是各位修士都在身边设下了禁制，听不太清他们在讨论些什么。¤The venue has become noisy, but the cultivators have set a prohibition around them, and it is not clear what they are discussing.
所以诸位若是能在其洞府内寻觅到涵虚仙人的秘宝，甚至获得其传承，其中好处自不用在下多说。¤So if you can find the secret treasure of Hanxu Immortal in his cave, or even obtain its inheritance, there is no need to say more about the benefits.
名号挺响亮，但老夫可不记得千年前的剑修有这号人物。¤The name is quite resounding, but the old man can't remember that the sword repairer had this character a thousand years ago.
没错，正是他！¤Yes, it is him!
关于涵虚仙府，在下有一言，请诸位一听。¤About Hanxu Xianfu, there is a word below, please listen to it.
正当大家准备退场时。一个意料之外的声音传入在场各位的耳中。¤Just as everyone was preparing to exit. An unexpected voice came into the ears of everyone present.
老头子你连自己的功法都忘了，不记得有这号人物也很正常。¤Old man, you even forgot your own practice. It's normal not to remember this person.
此次拍卖的物品是一枚灵石玉佩，其材质不过是稍好的灵石而已，主要价值嘛，还是其上所布的精妙阵法。¤The item to be auctioned is a spirit stone jade pendant. Its material is only a better spirit stone. The main value is the exquisite formation on it.
随着你成功拍下涵虚玉佩，这件引起各大势力豪掷灵石的物事，虽然不知道还会在宁州引起什么波澜，但至少现在也算是归处已定。¤As you successfully photographed the Hanxu jade pendant, this matter that caused the major forces to throw spirit stones, although I don't know what disturbances will be caused in Ning Province, but at least it is now considered to be settled.
若是各大势力联手进入，共同破解仙府阵法，而后合理分配其中收获，避免内斗的损失，才是切实壮大我正派之实力。¤If all the major forces join hands to break the Xianfu formation, and then rationally distribute the gains to avoid the loss of internal fighting, it will truly strengthen my decent strength.
公孙季说完顿了顿，像是在等别人打断他。但场中修士多是保持沉默，甚至有的修士抱着掺和其中机缘的想法，迫不及待的点点头。¤Gongsunji paused after speaking, as if waiting for someone to interrupt him. But most of the cultivators in the field remained silent, and some cultivators even nodded impatiently with the idea of ​​mixing with them.
看来你这{xiaozi}与涵虚仙人的缘分不浅，竟能接连获得涵虚仙府玉佩的消息。¤It seems that you, {xiaozi}, have a good destiny with Immortal Hanxu, to be able to obtain news of the jade pendant of Immortal Hanxu's residence one after another.
见笑了，公孙家虽在多年前因涵虚丢尽脸面，但如今魔道妖人蠢蠢欲动，还是以宁州正道发展为先，置私情于后。况且，被涵虚找上门的也不止公孙一家，只是在下认为不宜提起罢了。¤Just laughed, although the Gongsun family was embarrassed by Hanxu many years ago, but now the demon is ready to move, they still take the development of Ning Province Zhengdao as the first and put their selfishness behind. Moreover, the Gongsun family is not the only one who has been approached by Hanxu. It’s just that I think it’s inappropriate to mention it.
公孙季闻言脸色转阴，但很快就隐藏好自己的情绪。也没有反驳，只是假笑着拱了拱手，表示认同。¤Gongsun Ji's face turned dark when he heard that, but he soon hid his emotions. He didn't refute, but he smirked and arched his hands in agreement.
原本嘈杂的人流，在公孙季的言语下猛地安静起来。显然都对他要说的话兴趣不浅。¤The original noisy flow of people suddenly quieted under Gongsunji's words. Obviously, they were all very interested in what he was going to say.
相信大家都是为了仙府钥匙而来的，但还请诸位稍安勿躁，待在下介绍一番。¤I believe everyone is here for the key to the fairy mansion, but please be safe and restless, and I will introduce you later.
{vpunch=10,0.5}（台下某人）可是那个号称剑阵双绝，同阶无敌的涵虚仙人？¤{vpunch=10,0.5} (someone off the stage) But the immortal Hanxu who is known as the double sword array and invincible of the same order?
言归正传，在下最近探访得涵虚仙府便是在云汐城左近，若有诸位有意结队前往探访，在下便在云汐城恭候了。¤Close to the subject, Xia Xia recently visited Dehan Xuxian Mansion near Yunxi City. If you are interested in forming a team to visit, Xia will be waiting in Yunxi City.
近年来阵法大能并不多见，所以天机阁大胆推测，该拍品的主人是千年前的元婴散修涵虚仙人。¤In recent years, there're very few people who are maters of Array, so Heavens Secrets Pavilion speculates that the owner of the item is Nascent Soul independent Cultivator Sage HanXu from a thousand years ago.
我宣布，此次拍卖正式开始！低价3万灵石，每次加价不得低于1000灵石！¤I announce that this auction has officially started! The low price is 30,000 spiritual stones, and each increase in price shall not be less than 1,000 spiritual stones!
魏无极被气得直吹胡子，然后消失在铁剑中，不再理会你。¤Wei Wou-Ki was so angry that he blew his beard, then disappeared into the iron sword, not paying attention to you anymore.
在下游历时曾获得一些关于涵虚仙人的消息，值此拍卖之际，愿与在场正派道友分享一二。¤I have received some news about Hanxu immortals in the downstream. On the occasion of this auction, I would like to share something with the decent Daoists present.
只是没想到公孙兄竟会主动提起，我可听说那一战是公孙家多位长老轮番上阵，结果还被打得灰头土脸。更好笑的是几位长老联手都没突破涵虚仙人的阵法，只得请出老祖破阵，也不知是真是假。¤I just didn't expect that Brother Gongsun would take the initiative to mention it. I heard that in that battle, many elders from the Gongsun family took turns, and they were beaten up. What is even more funny is that none of the elders joined forces to break through the Hanxu immortal formation. Fa, I had to ask the ancestors to break the formation, but I don’t know if it is true or not.
一时间拍卖场加价声此起彼伏，你无意参与其中，选择在场外静候...¤Suddenly, the auction house raises one after another. You have no intention to participate in it, and you choose to wait outside the house...
（这公孙季说的堂而皇之，虽不知打的什么算盘。倒也方便了我探访涵虚仙府之事。）¤(This Gongsun Ji said so grandiosely, although I don't know what calculations he made. It also made it easier for me to visit Hanxu Immortal Mansion.)
（该死，这公孙季说的堂而皇之，也不知打得什么算盘。看来我单独探访涵虚仙府的想法多半是没戏了。）¤(Damn it, this Gongsun Ji said so grandiosely, and I don’t know what to do. It seems that my idea of ​​visiting Hanxuxian Mansion alone is probably out of play.)
随着拍卖师锤落音定，这件引起各大势力豪掷灵石的玉佩，虽然不知道还会在宁州引起什么波澜，但至少现在也算是归处已定。¤As the auctioneer's hammer is settled, this jade pendant that has caused major forces to throw spirit stones, although I don't know what disturbances will cause in Ning Province, at least it is now considered to be settled.
一时间拍卖场加价声此起彼伏，你也不甘寂寞的加入其中。¤For a time, the auction house raises one after another, and you are not willing to join them lonely.
涵虚仙人乃千年前突现的绝世剑修，其出身、师承不详，但仅凭一人，一剑，一阵，纵横宁州数百年。据说当时甚至以元婴修为与化神大能大战数十回合，最后即便是因境界差距而后力不济，也不过重伤逃走，并未陨落在大能手下。¤The Hanxu Immortal is a peerless sword cultivator who emerged thousands of years ago. His birth and pedigree are unknown, but he has been in Ning Province for hundreds of years with only one person, one sword, and one battle. It is said that at that time he even used the Nascent Soul cultivation base to fight against Deity Transformation cultivator. After dozens of rounds, even though he was weak due to the difference in realm, he escaped with serious injuries and did not fall under the power of the powerful.
经天机阁长老鉴定，该拍品上所布的阵法不但能感应识别其他的玉佩，还有自我防御功能，纵使尽元婴期巅峰修士之力也难以凭蛮力破除。¤According to the elders of Heavens Secrets Pavilion, the array on this lot can not only sense and identify other jade pendants, but also has a self-defense function. Even with the strength of the peak cultivators in the Nascent Soul period, it is difficult to break with brute force.
我刚入门的时候，曾听师祖提到过涵虚仙人破尽公孙家阵法，然后摆阵求战一事。¤When I first started, I heard Grandmaster mention that Lord Hanxu broke the Gongsun family formation and then set up his own as a challenge.
待与会者都坐定后，拍卖师走上台来。其身后的杂役推着一个蒙着红布的小车，你估摸着红布下就是这次拍卖会的主角了。¤After all the participants were seated, the auctioneer came onto the stage. The handyman behind him pushed a small cart covered with red cloth. You guessed that under the red cloth is the protagonist of this auction.
确实...也不知在这海上是否能发现什么端倪。¤Indeed... I don't know if any clues can be found in this sea.
不过我既已穿过碎星海域来到岛上，却未发生什么意外，想来家族族训必然有所纰漏。¤However, I have passed through the Broken Star Sea and came to the island without any accidents. If I want to come to the family training, there must be some mistakes.
既然如此，我们便先在这碎星岛上搜罗一番，看看能否发现什么线索。¤In this case, we will search this Broken Star Island first to see if we can find any clues.
这码头人声鼎沸，往来之人十之八九皆为商贩，想来此地便是碎星岛了。¤The docks are full of people and nine out of ten of the people are traders.
先前偷偷从圣坛离开恐怕已经引起他们的注意，我还是不要明目张胆地出现在这里了...¤I'm afraid I've already attracted their attention by sneaking away from the Holy Altar, so I'd better not appear here openly...
好不容易才潜入进岛，这里人多眼杂，很可能被认出来，我...¤It's hard to sneak into the island, there are so many people here, it's likely to be recognized, I...
哈哈，瞌睡送枕头，老子正好缺点灵石花！¤Haha, sleepy give pillows, I just have a shortcoming Lingshihua!
你就是岛主下令追捕的{FirstName}{LastName}修士？¤Are you the {FirstName}{LastName} cultivator ordered by the island owner to hunt down?
你一踏进店里，就察觉到许多异样的关注目光。¤As soon as you stepped into the store, you noticed a lot of strange attention.
周围的修士见你进店，纷纷低下头去，你偶尔听见角落传来的窃窃私语。¤When the surrounding cultivators saw you entering the shop, they all bowed their heads. You occasionally heard whispers from the corner.
管事有令，格杀勿论！¤There are orders in charge, no matter what you kill!
我的这艘旋龟舟是家父花重金雇人打造的，船身用元婴期海兽旋龟之壳所炼制，坚硬无比。我们便乘这艘灵舟出发吧。¤My father-in-law paid a lot of money to build this rotating tortoise boat. The hull is made from the shells of sea beasts in the Nascent period. It is extremely hard. Let's set off on this boat.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}今日气色不错，可准备好共同出海了？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} looks good today, are you ready to go to sea together?
你刚到码头，便远远地看见一个身影伫立在岸边，眺望着远处波涛汹涌的无尽之海，不知在想些什么。¤As soon as you arrived at the pier, you saw a figure standing on the shore from a distance, looking at the turbulent endless sea in the distance, not knowing what you were thinking.
这无尽之海上的灵气乱流飘忽不定，没有一艘好船可不行。¤The aura of this endless sea is turbulent and erratic. It can't do without a good ship.
在你与百里奇迅猛的攻势下，老者明显不敌。¤Under your and Bailiqi's swift and furious attack, the old man was clearly outmatched.
宅子里头...像是有什么奇怪的阵法，大抵和血脉有关。¤In the house... there seems to be some strange formation, probably related to blood.
你见状飞身上前，同百里奇一起向神秘老者使出了神通。¤When you saw this, you worked with Bailiqi on the mysterious old man.
那此番我们前去化龙海域探听虚实，定要小心提防。¤Then we will go to the Dragonborn Sea area to listen to the reality, and we must be careful.
百里兄无需自责，我看没准是那龙族胡搅蛮缠，害得百里族人一路迁徙！¤Brother Baili doesn't need to blame himself, I think it's the Dragon tribe who is stubbornly harassing and causing the Baili tribe to migrate all the way!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}言重了，碎星岛也非安全之地，未免夜长梦多。把这两瓶驱妖液带上，我们即日便启程前往化龙海域吧！¤Thank you {FirstName}{xiongdi}. Let us hope it does not come to that. Come, Broken Star Island is not a safe place, let us move now. Take these two bottles of Fey Repulsion Draught, and let us set off for the Dragonborn Sea!
听闻化龙海域内龙族居多，而这些龙族也并非都是水灵根，甚至还有天赋上乘的变异灵根。¤It is said that there are many dragons in the Dragonborn Sea, and these dragons are not all water spiritual roots, and they even have highly talented mutant spiritual roots.
他说完这句话，竟化作一条五爪金龙飞向天际，转瞬间便失去了影踪。¤After he said this, he turned into a five-clawed golden dragon and flew towards the sky, and disappeared in an instant.
不，这件事本就与{FirstName}{xiongdi}无关，化龙海域凶险异常，我怎好意思再让{xiongdi}涉险！¤No, this incident has nothing to do with {FirstName}{xiongdi}. The Dragonborn Sea is extremely dangerous. How am I embarrassed to put {xiongdi} in danger again!
这栋宅子似乎已经很久没人居住了，但从它庞大的规模来看从前居住在这里的人家一定非富即贵。¤This house seems to have been unoccupied for a long time, but judging from its sheer size, the people who lived here in the past must be either rich or expensive.
这灵力波动...看样子是有人触发了阵法。¤This spiritual power fluctuation... It looks like someone triggered the formation.
你有些好奇地跃上大门朝内看去，竟发现了一个熟悉的身影。¤You jumped up the door with some curiosity and looked inward, and found a familiar figure.
怎么说，老头？¤How do you say, old man?
难道我百里家竟与龙族有什么瓜葛？¤Does my Baili family have anything to do with the dragon clan?
龙族首领覆海大圣便是雷灵根，实力十分强大，可以元婴巅峰修为匹敌化神期修士。¤Lei Linggen, the leader of the dragon clan, the Great Sage of the Sea, is very powerful, and at the cultivation of peak Nascent Soul could match the cultivators of Deity Transformation.
我一直指摘海兽其心可诛，无端进攻广陵城，没想到罪魁祸首居然正是我们......¤I have been accusing the sea beasts of damaging his heart and attacking Guangling City for no reason. I didn't expect that the culprit was us...
我竟从未听过族中长辈说起此事！我自儿时便居于广陵城，还以为百里一族是土生土长的宁州人士...¤I have never heard the elders of the clan talk about it! I have lived in Guangling City since I was a child, and thought that the Baili clan was a native of Ning Province...
这宅子看起来有些古怪。¤This house looks a little weird.
百十招过后，百里奇逐渐落于下风。那神秘老者见此乘胜追击，几招便将百里奇败于掌下。¤After the hundred and ten moves, Bailiqi gradually fell in the wind. Seeing this, the mysterious old man was chasing after the victory and defeated Bailiqi with a few moves.
似乎特定血脉的人进入这个宅子阵法便会触发，或许是用来护宅吧。¤It seems that the formation of people of a certain bloodline will be triggered when they enter this house. Maybe it is used to protect the house.
转过热闹喧嚣的坊市，一条寂静的小巷吸引了你的注意。你穿过小巷，发现了一幢稍显破旧的宅子。¤Turning around the bustling city, a quiet alley attracted your attention. You walked through the alley and found a slightly dilapidated house.
没想到百里家的人居然还有胆子跑到祖宅这里，真当我们龙族是可欺之辈！¤Unexpectedly, people from the Baili family would have the courage to run to the ancestral house. We really think that our dragons are a deceitful generation!
你并不打算参与此事，与百里奇应酬几句后便离开了百里祖宅。¤You didn't intend to participate in this matter, and after a few conversations with Bailiqi, you left Baili's ancestral home.
你没有贸然出手，而是选择等待。百里奇与神秘老者二人战到一处，两人所用招式竟有八分相似。¤You didn't take the shot rashly, but chose to wait. Bailiqi and the mysterious old man fought at the same place, and the moves used by the two were almost similar.
两人愈战愈烈，你在一旁只觉招式虽然相似，但老者所用神通明显要比百里奇的精妙许多。¤The fighting between the two is getting fiercer. You just feel that although the moves are similar, the old man's magical powers are obviously much more subtle than Bailiqi's.
然而老者来势汹汹，似乎与百里家有着什么不为人知的龃龉。¤However, the old man is coming fiercely, and seems to have some unknown disagreement with the Baili family.
你飞身上前，同百里奇一起向神秘老者使出了神通。¤You fly forward, and together with Bailiqi, you begin to attack the mysterious old man with your magical power.
据海图所示，似乎碎星海域附近有片海域名为化龙，其中海兽多为龙族。¤According to the nautical chart, it seems that there is a sea domain name near the broken star sea area called Dragonborn, and most of the sea beasts are dragons.
电光火石间百里奇匆忙运起功法，堪堪接住了那一掌。你决定...¤Baliqi hurriedly transported the exercises between the electric light and flint, and it was able to catch that palm. You decide...
既然如此我还是不要贸然进入此地了...¤In that case, I still don't want to enter this place rashly...
哼，别以为这就算了。¤Huh, don't think that's it.
龙族...方才你我与他交手时，我分明感觉自己的功法与他本是同源。¤Dragon Clan...just now when you and I fought against him, I clearly felt that my practice was the same as him.
百里兄！¤Brother Baili!
似是听见了你的低呼，百里奇朝你的方向看来。你刚要说些什么，一阵强劲的掌风擦过你身侧向宅内的百里奇袭去。¤It seems that I heard your whisper, Bailiqi looked in your direction. Just as you were about to say something, a strong palm wind brushed your side and attacked Bailiqi inside the house.
一股巨大的灵力波动从宅子中心扩散开，恐怕整个碎星岛都能感受到如此剧烈的动荡。¤A huge wave of spiritual power spread from the center of the house, I am afraid that the entire Broken Star Island can feel such a violent turmoil.
正当你打算离开这里时，宅邸内部突然生出异变。¤Just as you were about to leave here, something unexpected happened inside the mansion.
阵法如何与血脉有关？¤How is the formation related to the bloodline?
你把先前打听到的消息转述给百里奇。¤You relay the news you heard earlier to Baric.
百里小贼纳命来！¤The little thief is coming!
对了，不知百里兄打听到多少关于化龙海域的消息？¤By the way, I don't know how much Brother Baili has heard about Dragonborn Sea?
百里兄，关于百里家与龙族之事我打听到的消息是这样的...¤Brother Baili, what I heard about the Baili Family and the Dragon Clan is this...
{FirstName}{xiongdi}所言有理，我便去打听打听那化龙海域，宅子的事就拜托{xiongdi}了。¤What {FirstName}{xiongdi} said is reasonable, so I went to inquire about the Dragonborn sea area, and I would like to ask {xiongdi} about the house.
但若贸然前去似乎有些冒险，这栋宅子说来古怪之处也颇多，不如我们分头打听一下再做打算。¤But it seems a bit risky to go rashly. This house has a lot of weirdness, so it's better for us to inquire about it separately and make plans.
前人洞府，神兽遗物，甚至传说中的上古龙宫...能找到一个便是无上的机缘了！¤The cave dwellings of predecessors, the relics of divine beasts, and even the legendary Ancient Dragon Palace... It is a great chance to find one!
现如今，蓬莎岛上的修士主要分为三类。一类以组队猎杀海兽，收集材料为主要目标，一类则是到处收购材料，从而赚取差价的私人商队。¤Today, the cultivators on Pongsha Island are mainly divided into three categories. One is a private caravan that hunts sea beasts in teams and collects materials as the main goal, and the other is a private caravan that buys materials everywhere to earn the difference.
这位道友看着眼生，应该是第一次来采筠阁吧？¤This fellow Taoist looked at his eyes, it should be the first time to come to Caiyun Pavilion, right?
至于最后一类，便是我们这些采筠阁内的修士。我们出海探索，发掘，研究各种能找到的古代文献与遗物，以期得到有用的情报，去发掘海域中隐藏着的秘宝。¤As for the last category, we are the cultivators in the Caiyun Pavilion. We go out to explore, excavate, and study all kinds of ancient documents and relics that can be found, in order to obtain useful information and to discover the hidden treasures in the sea.
这可不好说，这些珍贵的东西要不然就埋在哪座无人岛屿的泥土之中，也可能被什么海兽给吃进了肚子。总之，有缘自会发现。¤It's hard to say. Otherwise, these precious things will be buried in the soil of an uninhabited island, or they may be eaten by some sea beasts. In short, fate will find out.
你可以用它们交易到其它你感兴趣的情报，甚至只是单纯的换取灵石，也是不错的选择。¤You can use them to trade other information you are interested in, or even simply exchange them for spirit stones, which is also a good choice.
蓬莎岛实际是海上的修士们为了收集、交换海兽情报，寻找上古秘宝而结成的一个松散的散修同盟组织。¤Pongsha Island is actually an unofficial cultivator alliance formed by independent cultivators in order to collect and exchange information on sea beasts and search for ancient treasures.
哈哈哈，那是自然。而且即便是情报价值较低的遗物，在采筠阁内也不愁找不到买家。因为这里还有不少像我这样，只是单纯对古代文明和传说感兴趣的爱好者。¤Hahaha, that's natural. And even for relics with low intelligence value, there is no need to worry about finding buyers in Caiyun Pavilion. Because there are many fans like me who are simply interested in ancient civilizations and legends.
最初时，岛上只是时不时举办情报与物资的小型交易会。但随着名声传开，越来越多的散修汇聚到这里，举办拍卖会，交换情报，或是组队出海猎杀海兽，蓬莎岛也慢慢发展为无尽之海上的一股重要势力。¤In the beginning, the island was a small trade fair for information and supplies from time to time. But as the reputation spread, more and more independent cultivators gathered here, held auctions, exchanged information, or formed a team to go out to sea to hunt sea beasts. Pongsha Island has also gradually developed into an important force in the endless sea. .
单独的一份情报可能没什么作用，但若是情报拼凑成完整的线索，你就有可能真的发掘到那些传说中的遗迹。¤A single piece of information may not be useful, but if the information is pieced together into a complete clue, you may actually unearth those legendary ruins.
不错，这采筠阁与我想象的倒是大不一样，道友能否为在下介绍一二？¤Yes, this Caiyun Pavilion is very different from what I imagined. Can you give me a little introduction?
原来如此。那若是我找到了什么有价值的古代文献或遗物，也可以来这里交易么？¤I see. Then if I find any valuable ancient documents or relics, can I also come and trade here?
（真是稀奇，这采筠阁里尽摆的是一些看不懂的石刻碑文和没见过的奇怪物件，也不知究竟是做什么的...）¤(It's really strange. There are some incomprehensible stone inscriptions and strange objects that have never been seen in this Caiyun Pavilion. I don't know what they are doing...)
海域情报有什么用？¤What is the use of maritime intelligence?
去哪里能够找到这些古代遗物？¤Where can I find these ancient relics?
哈哈，采筠阁与蓬沙岛一脉相承，甚至可以说，采筠阁便是如今蓬沙岛的前身。道友可清楚蓬莎岛的由来？¤Haha, Caiyun Pavilion and Pongsha Island are in the same line, and it can even be said that Caiyun Pavilion is the predecessor of Pongsha Island today. Do you know the origin of Pongsha Island?
少了个翘家阔少，又回到了一人一剑的旅程，些许有些寂寞。\n¤Less a warped family broad, back to the journey of one person and a sword, a little bit lonely. \n
既然都来了武陵城，不如便先去那{color=#d0380a}升仙台{/color}看看吧。¤Since we are here in Wuling City, we might as well go to {color=#d0380a}Immortal Ascension Platform{/color} and have a look.
一说这我可就来劲了，当即冲上前去...你猜怎么着？¤As soon as I said this, I got enthusiasm, and rushed forward... guess what?
之前被关在府里修炼，可把我给憋坏了。¤Before, when I was locked up in the manor for cultivation I felt suffocated.
你挑眼望去，武陵城内杀声渐歇，城内的魔修已被扑杀殆尽。¤If you look carefully, the killing sound in Wuling City gradually ceases, and the evil cultivators in the city have been culled.
明明素不相识，却助少主脱困，真是英雄出少年。少主也不是初犯了，得让他好好闭门思过。¤Obviously, we didn't know each other, but you helped the young master get out of trouble. You really are a promising young hero. This is not the young master's first time breaking the rules, so he has to be grounded behind closed doors.
少主还是别浪费法宝了，以你的修为绝不可能当着我的面遁走。¤Young Master, it'll be better if you don't waste your magic weapons. With your cultivation base, its simply not possible to run away from me.
咳咳...这帮疯子。¤Ahem... these lunatics.
有剑阵相助，倪振东已是稳占上风。¤With the help of the sword array, Ni Zhendong has the upper hand.
{xiaozi}小心！！~这家伙要自爆元婴了！！！¤{xiaozi} Be careful!!~ This guy is going to blew the Nascent Soul!!!
“轰隆”{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Boom {vpunch=10,0.5}
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，难得又在武陵城相遇，怎么这就要走啦？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, it's rare to meet again in Wuling City, why are you leaving now?
你婉言拒绝了倪旭欣，他看上去很是失落...¤You politely rejected Ni XuXin, he looks very lost...
一道剑光划过，地面被斩出一道巨大的裂痕，而对面的魔修已经灰飞烟灭。¤A sword light swept across, a huge crack was cut out on the ground, and the evil cultivator on the opposite side was wiped out.
{FirstName}...{FirstName}{xiongdi}，等等我！¤{FirstName}...{FirstName}{xiongdi}, wait for me!
哈哈哈，凌轩小儿，把剑交出来！！！！¤Hahaha, Ling Xuan child, hand over the sword!!!
天空中出现青龙、白虎、朱雀、玄武，四象的虚影。¤There are phantoms of blue dragon, white tiger, vermilion bird, basalt and the four elephants in the sky.
道友请留步。我家宗主邀您来府上一聚。这份请帖还请收下。¤Friends of Taoism, please stay. My master invites you to come to the mansion for a gathering. Please accept this invitation.
呵呵呵，我知道的也就比这再多一点……放心，我对你没有恶意。¤Ohhhh, I know just a little bit more than that ...... Don't worry, I mean you no harm.
噗！¤puff!
倪振东，这是你逼我的！！¤Ni Zhendong, you forced me!!
你刚离开升仙台，便听到身后有人大声叫你。¤As soon as you left the Ascension Terrace, you heard someone calling your name from behind.
嘿嘿，上次是我大意了，这一次我可是有备而来。我拖住他，你们动手。¤Hey, I was careless last time, but this time I came prepared. I hold him, you do.
快快快，我带你去{color=#d0380a}升仙台{/color}了解了解，顺便跟你一起报个名玩玩，打个几场再溜也来得及……¤Quickly, I'll take you to the {color=#d0380a}Ascension Terrace{/color} to learn more about it, by the way with you to sign up for a game, a few games and then slip away also in time ......
但这些终究只是我们的猜测而已，如果能当面见到他，一切问题自当迎刃而解。¤But these are only our guesses after all. If we can meet him in person, all problems will be solved by themselves.
哼，废物一个。凌轩小儿，这次就放过你！！哈哈哈！¤Huh, a waste. Ling Xuan child, let you go this time!! Hahaha!
明明素不相识，却助少主脱困，真是英雄出少年。¤Obviously he didn't know each other, but he helped the young master get out of trouble. It's really a heroic youth.
这一次你们宫主不在，你说你能接我几剑？¤This time your palace master is not here, how many swords do you think you can pick me up?
你又以为我为什么会在这里等你？¤Why do you think I am waiting for you here?
想走？¤Want to go?
你快速退到一边。¤You quickly step aside.
的确，当年你与血剑宫弟子交手时我便有此疑惑。¤Indeed, I had this doubt when you fought against the disciples of the Blood Sword Palace.
地图都在你手里拿着了还能怎么着......¤What else can you do if you hold the map in your hands...
呵呵，我知道的也就比这再多一点……放心，我对你没有恶意。¤Hehe, I know a little bit more than this... Don't worry, I have no malice against you.
（倪少灰头土脸地离开了）¤(Ni XuXin leaves despondent and depressed)
倪兄的意思是...？¤Brother Ni means...?
我不来，你难道愿意自己回家吗？¤If i didn't come searching, would you have returned home of your own accord?
那我就在武陵城客栈，等您了。¤Then I will be at Wulingcheng Inn, waiting for you.
血剑宫剑法亦是通过损耗自身精血的方式施展，而且攻守招式都与白帝楼颇为相像。¤Blood Sword Palace's swordsmanship is also performed by depleting one's own essence and blood, and the offensive and defensive moves are quite similar to those of Baidilou.
请问有事吗？¤Is there anything wrong?
{xiaozi}，小心这是有化神修士来了。¤{xiaozi}, be careful, that is a Deity Transformation cultivator coming.
现在还想走？¤Want to leave now?
一道身影从白帝楼冲出和空中的血影纠缠起来。¤A figure rushed out of the Baidi Tower and became entangled with the blood shadow in the air.
家主嘱咐我带你回府，好好闭门思过。¤The Patriarch instructed me to take you back home and have you reflect on your mistakes behind closed doors.
突然，一道声音响彻全城。¤Suddenly, a voice resounded throughout the city.
一道道血红色的剑光从空中落下直逼武陵城，但途中被一一化解。¤A blood-red sword light fell from the sky and approached Wuling City, but was resolved one by one on the way.
你曾领悟过我御剑门神通，也学过白帝楼的剑招法门，可有察觉到其中差别？¤You have ever comprehended the magical powers of my Imperial Sword Sect and learned the sword techniques of Baidilou. Can you perceive the difference?
{xiongdi}你虽然刚出山不久，可千万不能不知道{color=#d0380a}英杰会{/color}啊！要是能夺魁争到{color=#d0380a}筑基丹{/color}，可是免去了筑基时的不少麻烦。¤{xiongdi}You may have just come out of the mountain, but you must not be unaware of the {color=#d0380a} Yingjiehui{/color} ah! If you can win the championship and compete for the {color=#d0380a} Foundation Establishment Pill{/color}, you can save yourself a lot of trouble when building your foundation.
记得当年宁州曾有一小派唤作禾山道，功法神通皆可通过损耗自身精血施展。¤Remember that there was a small faction in Ning Province that year called Heshan Dao, and the magical powers of the exercises can be used by depleting their own essence and blood.
你知道我的名字？¤You know my name?
（小心张望）{FirstName}{xiongdi}借一步说话...¤(Watch carefully) {FirstName}{xiongdi} take a step to speak...
此次协助守城，参与击杀魔修的修士，可以来我白帝楼领取奖励。¤This time assisting in defending the city and participating in the killing of the evil cultivators, you can come to my Baidi Building to receive rewards.
这种来历不明的地图你也相信？¤Do you believe in maps of unknown origin?
相传白帝楼是一千多年前由白帝亲手创建，从时间上看，倒也与凌轩师兄的修为相吻合。¤According to legend, the Baidi Tower was created by Baidi himself more than a thousand years ago. From the perspective of time, it also coincides with the cultivation level of Senior Brother Ling Xuan.
小友小心这这祭血使不是你能应付的。¤Little friend, be careful that this blood sacrifice envoy is not something you can handle.
突然，武陵城内剑光四起，直指白帝楼。¤Suddenly, the sword lights in Wuling City, pointing straight to the Baidi Tower.
两道遁光追逐而去，见势不妙，之前参与进攻的人四散而逃。¤The two escape lights chased away, seeing that the situation was not good, and the people who had participated in the attack before scattered and fled.
前些日子我在坊市里淘到一张神秘地图，据说这上面记录的可是某位大能的洞府遗迹。我本来正准备着要去探索一番，没想到就在城里遇见了你，真是巧极！¤I found a mysterious map in Fangshi a few days ago. It is said that it records the remains of a certain mighty cave mansion. I was planning to explore it, but I did not expect to meet you in the city. What a coincidence!
让我想想...御剑门的剑法飘逸灵动，一旦出手便是连绵不绝的攻势，以速度冠绝天下。¤Let me think about it... Imperial Sword Sect's swordsmanship is elegant and agile, once it is shot, it will be a continuous offensive, with the fastest speed in the world.
那有缘人必定是小爷我啊！走走走，有福同享，有福同享，找到了宝贝咱两平分！¤The destined person must be me! Walk around and share the blessings and share the blessings. If we find the treasure, we will divide the two equally!
一道血红色的剑光，自天而降半途被另一道飞出自白帝楼的剑光截下。¤A blood-red sword light, halfway down from the sky, was intercepted by another sword light flying out of the Baidi Tower.
好吧，是我唐突了。¤Well, I was abrupt.
要说最热闹的，就是今年举办的英杰会了，那可比东石谷还要火热。¤The most lively event was the Yingjie meeting held this year, which was even hotter than the East Stone Valley.
{FirrstName}道友，少主给你添麻烦了。¤Friend {FirrstName}, Young Master must have caused you no small amount of trouble.
（低声）你看这是什么？¤(Whispering) What do you think this is?
白帝楼剑法招式凌厉，威能不俗。但运气方式和御剑门截然不同，有时需损耗自身精血方能发挥招式最大威力。¤Baidilou's swordsmanship is powerful and powerful. However, the way of luck is very different from that of Imperial Sword Sect. Sometimes you need to consume your own essence and blood to achieve the maximum power of the moves.
{xiongdi}有所不知，本来我也将信将疑。当时那商贩周围想购买此图的人可谓是张袂成阴，不过他说这地图无需竞\r价，只售给有缘人。¤{xiongdi} didn't know something, and I was skeptical. At that time, the people around the vendor who wanted to buy this map were Zhang Yuchengyin, but he said that the map does not need to bid for the price, and it is only sold to people who are predestined.
四象封魔阵，起！¤Four Elephant Sealing Demon Array, get up!
哈哈哈，你以为我们没有准备吗？¤Hahaha, do you think we are not prepared?
我还是不要横生波折为好啊。¤I'd better not have twists and turns.
你曾领悟过我御剑门神通，也见识过白帝楼的剑招法门，可有察觉到其中差别？¤You have ever comprehended the magical powers of my Imperial Sword Sect, and have seen the sword techniques of Baidilou, have you noticed the difference?
（倪兄弟是否还在思过呢？正好去帮他说点好话……）¤(Brother Ni is still thinking about it? Just to help him say something nice...)
倪振东？？¤Ni Zhendong??
他小心翼翼地掏出一张看起来破破烂烂的旧皮纸，拿给你看。¤He carefully took out a piece of old leather paper that looked tattered and showed it to you.
倪兄？¤Brother Ni?
好在前段时间我突破到了炼气后期，好说歹说，才说服了杨叔放我出来历练一番。¤Fortunately, some time ago I managed to break through to the late stage of Qi Refinement and was able to convince Uncle Yang to let me out...
血河？就来了你一个人？¤Blood River? Are you here alone?
血剑宫的道友，在下等候多时了。¤Friends of the Blood Sword Palace, waiting here for a long time.
多谢前辈。¤Thank you, senior.
这是谁？仅凭威压就让我不得动弹！！¤Who is this? Just coercion makes me immobile!!
滚开，别挡我去路。¤Go away, don't block my way.
小女子对白帝楼鼎鼎大名的三才剑向往已久，但难以加入白帝楼...¤The little girl has long yearned for the famous Sancai Sword of Baidilou, but it is difficult to join Baidilou...
前些日子我在坊市里淘到一张神秘地图，据说这上面记录的可是某位大能的洞府遗迹。我这次来找你，正是想邀请你同我一起去地图上记载的遗迹寻宝。¤I found a mysterious map in Fangshi a few days ago. It is said that it is the relics of a certain mighty cave. I came to you this time because I wanted to invite you to go with me to record it on the map. Treasure hunt in the ruins.
杨管家！！！你怎么找到这来了！！！¤Steward Yang!!! How did you find me!!!
你总觉得事出反常，哪有什么遗迹地图会拿到坊市上这样大张旗鼓地出售。这倪家少爷看上去傻乎乎的没啥社会阅历，一准是被人给骗了。¤You always feel that something is abnormal. How can there be any ruins maps that would be sold in the Fang Market with such a big fanfare. This young master Ni family looks stupid and has no social experience, he must have been deceived.
...那可真是恭喜倪兄了。¤...That's really congratulations to Brother Ni.
等忙完英杰会，家主会在府上设宴答谢，还请务必赏光！¤After finishing the Yingjie meeting, the Patriarch will host a banquet at the mansion to thank you, and please be sure to give the honor!
第一次来武陵城吧？这可是我们倪家亲手所建。虽然规模比不得天星城，但也是远近闻名的散修云集之地。¤This is your first time in Wuling City right? Our Ni family's built this place with our own hands. Although its not as large when compared to likes of Heavenly Star City, it's still known far and wide as a place where independent cultivators gather.
我家宗主邀您来府上一聚,这份请帖还请收下。¤My master invites you to come to the mansion for a gathering, please accept this invitation.
你刚踏入武陵城，便听到有人大地呼喊你的名字。¤As soon as you stepped into Wuling City, you heard someone calling your name.
哼，找死。¤Hmph, looking for death.
你架不住倪旭欣的盛情邀约，虽然有些怀疑，但还是答应同他一起前往。¤You can't hold back Ni XuXin's kind invitation. Although you are a little skeptical, you still agree to go with him.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，真是好久不见。上次一别后我就被我爹被关在府里修炼，可把我给憋坏了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, it’s been a long time since I saw you. My father was locked up in the mansion for cultivating after the last time I left, but it hurt me.
这样想来，白帝楼的招式倒是有些像...¤Thinking about it this way, Baidilou's moves are a bit like...
少主既已归城，何不回府看看？¤Since the young master has returned to the city, why not go back to the mansion to have a look?
不知，道友你可否传我《人剑》《剑典-人道篇》，我愿出1000灵石酬谢你。¤I don't know, fellow daoists, can you tell me Human Sword and Sword Classic-Human Dao Chapter, I would like to give you 1,000 spiritual stones to reward you.
{xiaozi}，这家伙修为至少是金丹，不过被那疯子的自爆波及身受重伤，你倒不是不能一战。¤{xiaozi}, this guy's cultivation base is at least a golden core, but he was seriously injured by the madman's blew, it's not that you can't fight.
听说天魔道秘术皆要献祭自身精血方可施展，与白帝楼招式倒有异曲同工之妙。¤I heard that the secret arts of the Heavenly Demon Dao require sacrifice of their own essence and blood before they can be used. It has the same effect as the Baidilou moves.
虽然咱俩修为不够，估计拿不了什么名次，但是这英杰会{color=#d0380a}五年一次{/color}，可是难得一见。¤Although we are not good enough to win any rankings, this Yingjiehui {color=#d0380a} comes around once every five years{/color} and is a rare event.
等忙完英杰会，家主会在府上设宴答谢，还请小友务必赏光！¤When we are done with the Yingjie meeting, the head of the family will host a banquet at the house to thank you, so please do enjoy yourself!
莫非白帝还和魔门有什么渊源？¤Does Bai Di still have any connection with the Demon Sect?
你这{xiaozi}倒当真奇怪，这么重大的盛会不急着参加，倒想着出去晃晃，罢了，随你吧，别误了时间便好。¤You're a strange {xiaozi}, you're not in a hurry to attend such a big event, but you want to go out and hang around.
{xiaozi}，着急出城干什么，好不容易到了这武陵城，这升仙台怎么不去观上一观？¤{xiaozi}, why are you in a hurry to leave the city? You've easily arrived at this Wuling City, why don't you go to this ascension platform to have a look?
{xiaozi}，这种盛会，对现在的你而言，参加了总是有利无害的，哪怕观赛也能有所收获。¤{xiaozi}, this kind of event, for you now, is always beneficial to attend, even if you can get something out of watching the game.
这个嘛，修仙界的有头有脸的势力都会花心思举办诸如此类的盛会，以鼓励后进刻苦修行、相互切磋学习，让有能之人可以脱颖而出。¤Well, the most prestigious powers in the immortal cultivation world will take the trouble to organise such events to encourage the newcomers to cultivate hard and learn from each other, so that those who are capable can stand out.
好，孺子可教，咱们走吧。¤Good, the children can be taught, let's go.
倪府上下正在筹办英杰会，暂时不便接待外客。¤The Ni House is preparing for the Yingjie meeting, and it is temporarily inconvenient to receive outside guests.
看来秘市交易还没有开始，还是{color=#d0380a}明年{/color}再来吧。¤It seems the secret market trading hasn't started yet, or {color=#d0380a} come back next year{/color}.
这里空荡荡的，一个人也没有。¤This place is empty, not a single person.
你感受到了一股禁制之力阻挡你不能前进。\n¤You feel a forbidden force blocking you from advancing. \n
说来话长...¤It's a long story...
再次睁眼时，你们已经回到了百里奇的房间。¤When you open your eyes again, you have already returned to Baric's room.
百里兄，可是这盏石莲灯？¤Brother Baili, but this stone lotus lamp?
这是一处略显粗糙的石室，四周的石壁未经过细致的打磨，露出些许尖锐的棱角。铜制壁灯中昏暗的灵气火焰摇曳着，投出一片青色的光影。¤This is a slightly rough stone room. The surrounding stone walls have not been carefully polished, revealing some sharp edges and corners. The dim aura flames in the copper wall lamp swayed, casting a blue light and shadow.
...{FirstName}{xiongdi}？你怎会找到这里？¤...{FirstName}{xiongdi}? How did you find here?
这是何处......？¤Where is this...?
你将在百里府中遇到的事转述给百里奇，他一边听一边连连叹气。¤You told Bailiqi what you encountered in Baili Mansion, and he sighed again and again as he listened.
话说回来，百里兄又为何被这瓶中阵法所困？¤Speaking of which, why is Brother Baili trapped by this bottle of formation?
你与百里奇的灵力缓缓注入灯中，那石莲逐渐绽放出耀眼的光彩。一时间青光大盛，你二人不禁闭上双眼。¤The spiritual power of you and Bailiqi slowly poured into the lamp, and the stone lotus gradually bloomed with dazzling brilliance. For a time, the blue light was flourishing, and you two couldn't help but close your eyes.
阵眼便是石室正中的那盏石莲灯，先前我尝试过以力破阵，但没能成功。如今{FirstName}{xiongdi}来了，合你我二人之力应当能破开此阵。¤The eye of the formation is the stone lotus lamp in the middle of the stone room. I tried to break the formation with force but failed. Now {FirstName}{xiongdi} is here, and the strength of you and me should be able to break this. Array.
这阵法据说是父亲从公孙家那得来的，公孙季最擅长阵法之道，经常制些像这样精巧的阵法。¤This formation is said to have been obtained by his father from Gongsun's family. Gongsun Ji is best at formations and often makes such delicate formations.
龙珠被我藏了起来，父亲得知此事为防止我将龙珠送还给龙族，一气之下便将我关进了这里。¤The dragon ball was hidden by me. When my father learned of this, he was angrily locked in here to prevent me from returning the dragon ball to the dragon clan.
正是。{FirstName}{xiongdi}向其中注入灵力，其余交由我来便可。¤Exactly. {FirstName}{xiongdi} pour spiritual power into it, and leave the rest to me.
{shidi}，来药田所为何事？\n¤{shidi}, what is the reason for coming to the medicine field? \n
前辈，来药田所为何事？\n¤Elder, what is the reason for coming to the Medicine Field? \n
晚辈告退。\n¤The junior retire.\n
走走，而已，你不用管我。¤Just go, just leave me alone.
没事，走走而已。\n（刚刚隐约一股神识扫过，果然宗门重地深藏不漏啊。）¤It's okay, just walk away.\n (I just swept through a vague sense of consciousness just now, and the sect is deeply hidden.)
原来，师兄当值药田。\n（果然，宗门重地不可能，只有筑基期弟子驻守。）¤It turns out that brother is on duty in the medicinal field.\n (Sure enough, the sect is impossible, only the disciples of the foundation building period are stationed.)
师兄，前来药田所为何事？\n¤Brother, why did you come to the medicine field?\n
{shidi}，这宗门内部的药田内种植的都是非常珍贵稀有的草药，普通弟子是不能擅自采集的。¤{shidi}, the medicine fields within this sect are planted with very precious and rare herbs, and ordinary disciples are not allowed to collect them without permission.
你将{$shili}秘籍几乎洗劫一空后，在一众敢怒不敢言的修士注视下，满足的离开了。至于之后{$shili}作何反应，那也不是你想关心的了。¤After you almost ransacked the {$shili} cheats, under the gaze of a crowd of cultivators who dared not say anything, you left contentedly. As for how {$shili} reacts afterwards, that is not what you want to care about.
道友不必远送，有机会还会再来的，哈哈哈。¤You don't have to send away friends, you will come again if you have a chance, hahaha.
也没什么好东西，今日就算卖{$shili}个面子吧。¤There is nothing good, even if you sell {$shili} a face today.
哼，这便是我{$shili}的全部神通功法了，自行取阅。¤Hmph, this is all my {$shili} magical powers, read it by myself.
（每选取一本秘籍会导致对应程度的声望下降）¤(Each selection of a cheat book will cause the corresponding degree of prestige to decrease)
“难道这是老头儿之前提到的阵法...？”¤Is this the formation that the old man mentioned before...?
圣地之门已开，接下来就由连管事带领小友前往圣地领悟秘法了。¤The door to the Holy Land has been opened, and then Guan Guan will lead the little friends to the Holy Land to understand the secret method.
难道说圣坛其实并没有建造在很深的地底？¤Could it be that the altar was not actually built deep underground?
你随着管事走下面前的台阶，长长的石梯仿佛要深入地底似的，怎么走也走不到尽头。¤You follow the steward down the front steps, the long stone ladder seems to go deep into the ground, and you can't go to the end no matter how you walk.
管事在一旁微笑着注视你，看来这扇门也是考验中的一环，想必推不开这扇门的修士便与功法无缘了。¤Guan Shi is watching you with a smile. It seems that this door is also part of the test. Presumably the cultivators who can't open this door have no chance with the practice.
此话怎讲？¤how do I say this?
实际上这楼梯并不是很长，你们只是在原地打转而已。¤Actually, the stairs are not very long. You are just turning around in place.
既然如此，便先请{$daoyou}随管事圣坛前稍加等候，本座稍事准备即可带小友前往圣坛。¤In that case, please wait for a while in front of the sacred altar with the steward, and I will take you to the sacred altar after a little preparation.
也罢，本座从不强迫别人，{$daoyou}若有自己的顾虑不愿加入势力也无妨，你永远是我们千流岛的客人。¤So be it, I never force people, {$daoyou} it's okay if you have your own concerns about not wanting to join the force, you will always be a guest of our Thousand Streams Island.
你们走入主岛正中肃穆庄严的楼阁，穿过层层回廊后来到了岛主平日修炼之地。¤You walk into the solemn and solemn pavilion in the middle of the main island, pass through the corridors and then arrive at the island owner's usual practice place.
哈哈哈，{$daoyou}果然有气魄，千流岛正是缺少你这般人才！¤Hahahaha, {$daoyou} really has the guts, Thousand Stream Island is lacking talents like you!
千流岛岛主闻言露出一丝微妙的笑容，这笑容一闪而过，让你以为只是自己生出了错觉。¤The island owner of Qianliu Island showed a subtle smile when he heard the words. This smile flashed by, making you think that you were just having an illusion.
随着注入灵气的增多，门上的阵法纹路散发出的光芒也愈发明亮，在你的灵力快要枯竭的紧要关头，木门灵光大盛，将你吸了进去。¤As the amount of spiritual energy injected increases, the lines on the door are shining brighter and brighter. At the critical moment when your spiritual power is about to be exhausted, the wooden door is full of aura and sucks you in.
{FirstName}道友，请随我来吧。¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, please come with me.
{FirstName}道友，此门之后便是圣坛所在。¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, behind this door is where the altar is.
木门吸取了你的灵气后逐渐生出繁复的纹样，你仔细地端详着散发微弱光芒的纹路，试图分辨出它的功用。¤The wooden door absorbs your aura and gradually produces complex patterns. You carefully examine the patterns that emit a faint light, trying to distinguish its function.
见过岛主，在下来自宁州，名为{FirstName}{LastName}。¤I have seen the island owner, from Ning Province, named {FirstName}{LastName}.
你将顾忌压下心头，上前一步介绍起自己。¤You put your scruples under your heart, step forward and introduce yourself.
千流岛的功法都置于圣坛内，届时{$daoyou}挑选完毕，可直接在这圣坛中修炼。¤The techniques of the Thousand Streams Island are all placed within the Sacred Altar, and when {$daoyou} have finished selecting them, they can be directly cultivated in this Sacred Altar.
若{FirstName}{$daoyou}愿成为千流岛供奉，圣坛内的秘法可任你选择，届时这无尽之海中与你同等修为的修士都不能再对你构成威胁！¤If {FirstName}{$daoyou} is willing to become a guest elder of the Thousand Streams Island, you can choose any of the secret techniques within the Sacred Altar, and then no cultivator of the same level as you in this Endless Sea can pose a threat to you anymore!
我观{$daoyou}灵气充盈，道法天成，想来必为人中龙凤。¤I see that {$daoyou} is full of spiritual energy and has a heavenly dao, so I think he must be a dragon and a phoenix among men.
恭喜岛主，我圣教又将新添一位实力出众的供奉。¤Congratulations to the island lord, our sacred church will have another outstanding guest elder.
你向门内望去，整齐的石梯向下延伸至视野尽头，看来千流岛的圣坛应该就在这地下了。¤You look inside the door, and the neat stone ladder extends down to the end of your field of vision. It seems that the altar of Qianliu Island should be underground here.
言罢，那连家管事将你带回楼阁一层的一扇大门前，等候着岛主的到来。¤After that, the housekeeper will take you back to a door on the first floor of the pavilion, waiting for the arrival of the island owner.
你上前把手放在门上，用力推了一下，按修为来讲你的肉体力量不容小觑，没想到那木门竟纹丝未动！¤You stepped up and put your hand on the door and pushed hard. According to your cultivation level, your physical strength should not be underestimated. I didn't expect that the wooden door has not moved at all!
千流岛功法与这圣坛有密不可分的联系，{$daoyou}在修炼过程中自能体会其中奥妙。¤The Thousand Streams Island Technique is inextricably linked to this sacred altar, and {$daoyou} will be able to appreciate the subtleties of it in the process of cultivation.
这楼梯看似没有尽头，却不过是楼阁中所布的一个阵法罢了。¤This staircase seems to have no end, but it's just a formation in the pavilion.
你跟随连家管事通过一处阵法来到千流岛内部的主岛。此地为千流岛圣坛所在之处，岛主平时也居住在此。¤You follow the housekeeper to the main island inside Qianliu Island through a formation. This is where the altar of Qianliu Island is located, and the island owner usually lives here.
不错，这圣坛岂止不在地底，如果我想得没错，它甚至根本不在这楼阁的下面。我猜你们再走一会儿，他就会让你通过阵法到达圣坛的所在地了。¤Yes, this altar isn't just underground. If I think it's right, it's not even under the pavilion. I guess if you walk a little longer, he will let you reach the place of the altar through the formation.
你将灵力凝在掌中，再次尝试推开木门。说来也怪，你掌上的灵力与木门相接时便如石沉大海般消融不见。¤You concentrate your spiritual power in your palm and try to open the wooden door again. It's strange to say that when the spiritual power in your palm meets the wooden door, it melts away like a rock.
连家管事将你带到一扇厚重的木门前，示意你推开门走进去。¤The housekeeper led you to a heavy wooden door and motioned you to open the door and walk in.
这千流岛倒是有几分心机。¤This Qianliu Island is a bit distracting.
“有点意思......”¤interesting......
你从储物袋里取出这两样东西，按魏无极所说兑成晶莹的液体。¤You take these two things out of your storage bag and mix them into a crystal clear liquid as Wei Wuji said.
哼，要是现在不叫醒你，恐怕你这辈子也醒不了了！¤Hmph, if I don't wake you up now, I'm afraid you won't be able to wake up in this life!
可能因这功法过于霸道，才令其他方面有了缺陷。¤Maybe because this technique is too domineering, it makes other aspects flawed.
你将这功法前篇修练一番于我看看，说不定便能摸清其中门道。¤Take a look at the first part of this exercise, and you may be able to figure out the way.
看来这阵法能够放大功法中的纰漏，将暗含的离魂咒融入你的识海中，如此便可掌握修练功法的修士。¤It seems that this formation method can amplify the flaws in the exercise method, and integrate the implied Lihun curse into your sea of ​​consciousness, so that you can master the cultivators who practice the exercise method.
突然之间，你脑中传来一阵剧痛，原是魏无极见你沉迷其中便用了神识攻击，将你从修炼中唤醒。¤Suddenly, there was a sharp pain in your mind. It was Wei Wuji that saw you indulge in it and attacked with divine consciousness, awakening you from cultivation.
好，好...¤Good, good...
多了一些不明不白的东西，我分辨不出来...¤There are more unclear things, I can't tell...
这功法看起来有扰魂之效，连家身为千流岛第一大家族，传承功法本不应出现这种纰漏才对。¤This technique seems to have the effect of disturbing the soul. As Lian's family is the largest family in Qianliu Island, there should be no such mistakes in the inheritance technique.
管事当真不愿放行？¤Do you really want to let it go?
那之后魔修又寻机夺舍了我取而代之，并将我的元神困于此处修练秘法。¤After that, evil cultivator looked for an opportunity to take my place and replaced it, and trapped my soul here to practice the secret technique.
你将它细细引导出来，让我看看此为何物。¤You guide it carefully and let me see what it is.
正因如此，你侥幸逃离了这个魔窟。¤Because of this, you escaped this magic cave by luck.
你神魂目前状况如何？¤How is your spirit now?
道友得了我连家秘术后才心生悔意，恐怕太迟了些吧？¤Friends of Taoism only felt regret after I even had a family secret service. I'm afraid it's too late, isn't it?
霎时间从阴影里跳出几位身着黑袍的修士将你围住，齐齐向你发动攻击。¤In an instant, several cultivators in black robes jumped out of the shadows to surround you, and attack you all together.
我在密室内左思右想，感觉还是自在无拘的修仙生活更适合我。¤I think about it in the secret room, and I feel that the unrestrained life of immortality is more suitable for me.
我乃千流岛岛主连盛平，受魔门桎梏，在此地受苦已有百千年！¤I am Lian Shengping, the owner of Qianliu Island. I have been shackled by the Demon Gate and have suffered here for hundreds of years!
这些书简便是连家秘传的功法与神通，以道友目前对于千流岛的贡献，道友可修习的是这本《灭灵诀》。¤These books are simple and simple exercises and magical powers secretly passed down by Lian's family. Based on the current contributions of Daoists to Qianliu Island, what Daoists can study is the Spirit Extinguishing Technique.
功法我并未修练，管事可随时收回。¤I haven't practiced the exercises, and the steward can take it back at any time.
我仔细观察了一下，这些阵法虽对你的修练有着极强的增益，但会在其中加入一些诡异的效果。¤I took a closer look. Although these formations have a strong boost to your training, they will add some weird effects.
只觉刺骨的阴寒之气扑面而来，你急忙运起灵气护体。¤Only feel the biting cold air rushing toward your face, you hurriedly transported the aura body protection.
顷刻，令人舒畅的暖流冲洗着你的四肢百骸，丹田也涌起一丝暖意。你沉浸在功法带来的美妙感觉中，想要继续修炼下去。¤In an instant, the comforting warm current flushed your limbs and skeletal bodies, and a hint of warmth surged in your dantian. You are immersed in the wonderful feeling brought by the exercises, and you want to continue practicing.
你觉得此物不似善类，还是少沾染为妙。你逃出此地，飞快地沿着台阶向上，离开了这座楼阁。¤You don't think this thing is kind, it's better to be less contaminated. You escaped from here, hurried up the steps, and left the pavilion.
道友这是......？¤Fellow Daoist, is this...?
可岛主分明还健在，前辈可否将其中缘由讲来？¤But the island owner is clearly still alive, can you tell me the reason?
你一心只想变得强大，并没有过多在意此事，毕竟强劲的功法有些弊端也并非不能接受。¤You just want to be strong, and you don't care too much about it. After all, there are some drawbacks in the powerful technique and it is not unacceptable.
你察觉到机会，祭出法宝攻了上去！¤You noticed the opportunity, and attacked with a magic weapon!
在你艰难抵抗寒气时，从这祭台中传出飘忽虚渺的声音。¤As you struggled to resist the cold, a faint voice came from this altar.
我怎么会在这种地方，到底发生什么了？¤Why am I in such a place, what the hell happened?
我实在是心有余而力不足，还是保全自己要紧。¤I really don't have enough energy, but it's important to protect myself.
老头儿，你干什么！¤Old man, what are you doing!
只见连盛平的躯体蓦地升腾起翻涌的灵气，不须多时他的修为便逐渐地弱了下去。¤I saw Lian Shengping's body suddenly rise with surging spiritual energy, and it didn't take long for his cultivation level to gradually weaken.
不知为何此处极其阴冷，你四下搜寻了一番，角落里一块祭台散发着森白的光芒。¤I don't know why it is extremely cold here, you searched around, an altar in the corner exudes a white light.
没想到连家背后这等猖狂，也不知究竟有多少修士遇害过...¤Unexpectedly, even the madness behind the house, how many cultivators have been killed...
你用力推开木门，正见到门外一脸愕然的的连家管事。¤You pushed open the wooden door hard, and you saw the stupefied family manager outside the door.
幕后黑手不除，恐怕日后还会有更多的修士遭此毒手。¤If the culprit behind the scenes is not removed, I am afraid that more cultivators will suffer from this poison in the future.
这功法果然邪门儿，老头儿！¤This technique is really evil, old man!
不止是功法邪门儿，方才你修练的时候这石台上的阵法也全部都亮了起来。¤It's not just the evil way of cultivation, just now when you were practicing, all the formations on the stone platform were also lit up.
这功法邪门儿得紧，方才你修练之时圣坛上所纹刻的阵法接连亮起，似乎与这功法有所呼应。我仔细观察了一下，这些阵法虽对你的修练有着极强的增益，但会在其中加入一些诡异的效果。¤This technique is too tight. The formations engraved on the altar were lit up one after another when you were practicing. It seems to echo this technique. I observed carefully, although these formations are right for you. Training has a strong gain, but some weird effects will be added to it.
若我将前辈放出，前辈能否保证夺回身体后，日后的千流岛不会对供奉施此毒术？¤If I release the seniors, can seniors guarantee that after taking the body back, the Qianryu Island in the future will not use this poison on the guest elders?
幸好你先前修练过敛息方面的功法，你运起功法，悄悄地逃离了这座诡异的建筑。¤Fortunately, you have previously practiced the exercises for restraining your breath. You picked up the exercises and quietly escaped from this weird building.
得了岛主的承诺，你谨慎地拔除了骨钉破除阵法，放出他的元神。¤With the promise of the island owner, you carefully pull out the bone nails to break the formation and release his soul.
擂台管事不知从哪掏出一只通体莹白的哨子，放在嘴边吹响。¤The ring manager took out a white whistle from nowhere and put it on his mouth to blow it.
你靠近祭台，刺骨的寒意向你袭来，霎时间令你感觉元神仿佛都要被这阵寒意冻住。¤As you approach the altar, the biting chill hits you, and in an instant it makes you feel as if your soul is about to be frozen by the chill.
我明明是来修练功法的...你们连家欺人太甚！¤I'm obviously here to practice the exercises...you even deceive your family too much!
你依魏无极所言捕住那缕黑气，小心地将它牵离自己的识海。¤According to Wei Wuji's words, you catch the black qi and carefully pull it away from your sea of ​​consciousness.
修炼了这个功法？¤Practicing this technique?
先前遇到的千流岛修士看起来十分冷漠的原因难道是因为...¤The reason why the cultivators of Qianliudao I met before seemed so indifferent is because...
千年前有位魔修夺舍了我的心腹，献上离魂咒并唆使我控制岛上供奉。唉...我一时鬼迷心窍，听信魔门谗言，待供奉皆被控制后那魔修施法令其全部听从他的命令，一举夺得了千流岛内部的控制权。¤Thousands of years ago, a evil cultivator took away my confidant, offered the curse of leaving the soul and instigated me to control the guest elders on the island. Alas... I was obsessed for a while and listened to the devil’s slander. After the offerings were all controlled, the evil cultivator’s enactment order He obeyed all his orders and seized control of Qianliu Island in one fell swoop.
但若阵法受损，背后控制这一切的人定有所感知，届时恐怕会有一场苦战。¤But if the formation is damaged, the people who control it behind must have a sense of it, and I am afraid there will be a hard fight by then.
连家实在过分，竟如此对待前来投靠的修士！老头儿，有没有什么办法能解开这离魂咒？¤The Lian family is too much to treat the cultivators who come to take refuge in this way! Old man, is there any way to unlock this Lihun curse?
唉...那我便长话短说......¤Oh... then I will make a long story short...
莫非这连家故意唆使供奉修练有纰漏的功法，再加以利用控制他们的心神？¤Could it be that this Lianjia deliberately instigated the practice of flawed exercises, and then used them to control Guest Elder's minds?
你阖上双眸，检查着自己识海内的状况，你敏锐地发现一丝诡谲的黑气盘旋在其中。¤You close your eyes and check the situation in the sea, and you keenly notice a hint of strange black air hovering in it.
哦？离魂咒...没想到这种毒辣的禁术居然传承千年还未绝迹。此术正如其名，可将修士神魂与肉身分离，千年前多有邪修以此控制修士制成傀儡。¤Oh? Lihun curse... I didn't expect this kind of poisonous forbidden technique to be passed down for thousands of years and not extinct. As its name suggests, this technique can separate the soul of the cultivator from the body. A thousand years ago some evil cultivator used this technique to make another cultivator into a puppet.
得知了连家阴谋的你决定趁早逃出这里，你选择¤After learning about the conspiracy of the Lian family, you decided to escape here as soon as possible, you choose
《灭灵诀》可以令道友的神通更上一层，强无敌手。¤Ling Ling Jue can improve the magical powers of fellow Taoists and become invincible.
机缘巧合之下你破开阵法，禁锢我的封印之力也因此薄弱许多，才会令我这元神的波动外泄。¤By coincidence, you broke the formation, and the power of the seal that imprisoned me was therefore much weaker, so that the fluctuations of my soul would leak.
说完，管事便转身离开了，你站在圣坛旁仔细地端详着手中的功法。¤After speaking, the steward turned and left. You stood by the altar and carefully studied the exercises in your hands.
正在此时，你的识海中突然传来一阵神秘的波动，像是有什么吸引着你一般，你转头看去，却是一扇墙壁。¤At this moment, a mysterious wave suddenly appeared in the sea of your knowledge, as if something was attracting you, but when you turned your head to look at it, it was a wall.
千流岛上虽好，但终究受人管辖，恐怕与我道心相悖。¤Although Qianliu Island is good, it will be under the control of others. I'm afraid it's against my heart.
祭台上八颗骨钉整齐地按八卦的方位排开，一抹惨淡的元神在中央摇曳着。¤The eight bone nails on the altar are neatly arranged in the direction of the gossip, and a bleak primordial spirit is swaying in the center.
可是有人进来了？若你助本座脱离这里，本座定不会薄待于你！¤But someone has come in? If you help this seat get out of here, this seat will certainly not treat you lightly!
这阵法绘以百兽血，布阵难破阵却容易，你只需拿些块寒玉磨成粉末兑上灵泉水冲洗纹刻便可。¤This formation is painted with the blood of beasts. It is difficult to break the formation, but it is easy. You only need to grind some cold jade into powder and mix it with the spring water to wash the pattern.
多谢小友，若本座取回身体...¤Thank you, my little friend, if you get your body back...
权衡益弊后你终究还是选择修练连家秘法，你端坐在圣坛之上，尝试着运行功法。¤After weighing the pros and cons, you still choose to practice the Lianjia secret technique. You sit on the altar and try to perform the exercises.
你摇了摇头，忽略掉这股感觉，飞快地逃出了这座楼阁。¤You shook your head, ignoring the feeling, and quickly escaped from this pavilion.
你放缓脚步，靠近那面墙壁。墙面蓦地生出一股强大的吸力，将你吸进了墙内。¤You slowed down and approached the wall. Suddenly a strong suction came from the wall, drawing you into the wall.
你心头一震，方才刚见过岛主连盛平，他的元神又怎会在此处被困百千年？¤Your heart is shocked. You have just met the island owner Lian Shengping. How can his soul be trapped here for hundreds of years?
正交谈时魔修假冒的岛主从一旁冲出，双手成爪向你袭来。想必是他已感知阵法被毁，前来探查消息。¤During the conversation, the evil cultivator impersonating the island owner rushed out from the side and attacked you with claws in his hands. Presumably he has already sensed the destruction of the array and came to investigate the news.
愿助前辈剿灭魔修！¤It's my pleasure to help the Senior to eliminate evil cultivators!
让我想想...当年我对这等邪术避而不及，故所知甚少。¤Let me think about it... Back then, I couldn't avoid such witchcraft, so I didn't know much about it.
听了魏无极的话，你端坐在圣坛之上，尝试着将功法运行一个小周天。¤After hearing Wei Wuji's words, you sit on the altar and try to run the exercises for a small week.
你回过神来的时候，已经来到了一间广阔的石室。石室四周摆放着整齐的功法誊录书简，正中则是一块刻满阵法的巨大石台。¤When you come back to your senses, you have already come to a vast stone room. The stone room is surrounded by neatly transcripts of exercises, and in the center is a huge stone platform full of formations.
道友不必再多说了，你可是执意要离开此地？¤You needn't say more, fellow Taoist, but you insist on leaving here?
虽然有心帮助，但你远不是元婴修士的敌手，只能道声抱歉自己逃命。¤Although you are willing to help, you are far from the enemy of the Nascent Soul cultivator. You can only say sorry to run for your life.
一旁的管事念了几句口诀解开书柜的阵法，功法从中取出。¤The steward on the side read a few dictums to unlock the bookcase's formation, and the exercises were taken out of it.
小友，我尽力压制住他，约令他修为降至元婴初期，你可否助我一臂之力将这魔修制服？¤Little friend, I tried my best to suppress him and asked him to reduce his cultivation to the early stage of Nascent Soul. Can you help me to subdue this evil cultivator?
施术者若能停止阵法当然最好，退而求其次，毁掉阵法也可令受支配的修士清醒过来。¤If the spellcaster can stop the formation, of course it's best, and the next best thing is. Destroying the formation can also make the cultivators under control sober.
说时迟那时快，岛主的元神似电光般钻进了他的眉心。连盛平尖啸一声，抱着头乱窜起来。¤It's too late and it's fast, the island owner's soul got into the center of his eyebrows like an electric light. Lian Shengping gave a sharp scream, holding his head and scurrying around.
你沿着台阶飞快地向上跑去，那魔修大概忙着与岛主的元神纠缠，并未追上前来。¤You ran up the steps quickly, the evil cultivator was probably busy entangled with the island owner's primordial spirit, and did not catch up.
这阵法要如何毁去？¤How can this formation be destroyed?
这千年来我已尝尽苦果，愿以元神赌誓绝不再碰邪术！¤I have tasted the bitter fruit for thousands of years, and I would like to gamble with my soul to never use sorcery again!
道友可在圣坛上修炼融汇此功法，我会在门外为你护法。¤My fellow Daoist, you can practice and integrate this technique on the altar, and I will guard you outside the door.
略显陈旧的石室内盈溢着充沛的灵气，你恍然大悟岛主方才所说的话的涵义。¤Slightly old stone room is overflowing with a lot of aura, you suddenly understand the meaning of what the island owner just said.
随着玉液的冲刷，阵法一角上的纹路很快变得浅淡起来。于此同时，门外传来一阵骚动。¤With the scouring of the jade liquid, the lines on the corner of the formation quickly became light. At the same time, there was a commotion outside the door.
原来是你这臭{xiaozi}在此造次！本座定拿你炼个招魂幡以平胸中之愤！¤So it's you, you stinky {xiaozi}, who's making a scene here! I'll make you a soul-stirring streamer to calm my anger!
我总觉得连家的功法有些怪异之处...每本都不似善类。¤I always feel that there is something weird about even the family's exercises... every book is not kind of good.
看来这千流岛连家确实古怪，先前遇到的千流岛修士也多冷漠之辈，难道正是因为修练了此功法？¤It seems that Qianliu Island's family is indeed weird, and the cultivators on Qianliu Island I have encountered before are many indifferent generations. Is it because they have practiced this technique?
不知前辈何许人也？¤I don't know who the seniors are?
连盛平躯体内的两个元神争执起来，你时而听见魔修的咆哮，时而听见岛主的低吟，样子诡怪至极。¤The two primordial spirits in Lian Shengping's body are arguing, and you sometimes hear the roar of the evil cultivator, and sometimes the groan of the island owner, which looks extremely weird.
你趁着他们乱成一团的时候连忙逃出了木门，沿着台阶向上跑去。¤You rushed out of the wooden door while they were in a mess, and ran up the steps.
你依稀记得，魏无极似乎提起过此地圣坛的异样。你决定...¤You vaguely remember that Wei Wuji seems to have mentioned the strangeness of the altar here. You decide...
你回忆着魏无极先前说过的话，决定到圣坛内部仔细探查一番。¤Recalling what Wei Wuji said before, you decided to go inside the altar and investigate it carefully.
唉，你啊！就由老夫来你祝你一臂之力。¤Oh, you! The old man will come to you and wish you a helping hand.
（这两个笨蛋还不知道再也等不到天邪子了）¤(These two idiots don’t know that they will never be able to wait for the evil son)
据护法所说，黑心和那蛊真人大战一场，受了重伤，八成不会继续呆在此地，你我不过是以防万一罢了。¤According to the guardians, Black Heart had a battle with that True Person Gu, and was seriously injured, and 80% of them would not stay here anymore. You and I are just in case.
你将神识发散开来。¤You spread the divine consciousness.
咱们就在这里混混时间，毕竟那蛊真人也不是善茬，等护法真的抓住了他回来，咱就撤。¤Let's mess around here, after all, Lord Gu is not a good person. When the Guardian actually catches him back, we will leave.
最好不会。¤Better not.
此地有不少令人致幻的毒物，嘿嘿嘿...¤There are a lot of hallucinogenic poisons here, hehehe...
怎讲？¤How do you tell?
两人毫无防备的被你放倒。¤The two were brought down by you unsuspectingly.
（这两个傻子，我啥都没问就都说出来了，这太巧了吧）¤(These two fools, I said everything without asking, this is a coincidence)
你说，我们守在这里，那叛徒会不会回来？¤You said, we are here, will the traitor come back?
你感受到，一股温和的神识之力注入你的识海。¤You feel that a gentle force of divine consciousness is injected into your sea of ​​consciousness.
谁？\n¤Who?\n
唉，你这丹道修为就不要丢人现眼了。¤Hey, don't be ashamed of your alchemy cultivation base.
前方气息似有他人。¤There seems to be someone else in front of you.
你傻了不成，黑心乃是金丹高手，又偷了嗜血珠，要是真的遇到。就算是他身受重伤，你我纵使发出了信号，也断没有活路啊。¤You are stupid. Black heart is a master of gold core and stole the bloodthirsty bead. If you really encounter him. Even if he is seriously injured, even if you and I send out the signal, there is no way to survive.
也对啊，但是这宁州乃是正道腹地，一直呆在这儿也不是个办法啊。¤That's right, but this Ning Province is a righteous hinterland, and staying here all the time is not a way.
一番动作非但没有生效，反倒让对面发现了你。¤Not only did the action not take effect, but the other side found you.
不错，然后你控制这药液，让其均匀地覆盖你的皮肤表面。雪玉骨参之中蕴含的极寒之气可护住你的经脉，减缓三阳玄火对你躯体的伤害。¤Good, now control the liquid medicine to evenly cover the surface of your skin. The extremely cold energy contained in the Frostbone Ginseng can protect your meridians and slow the damage of the Tri Sun Profound Fire to your body.
你已准备就绪，和魏无极来到先前发现的地点寻找三阳玄火。¤You are ready, and Wei Wuji came to the previously discovered location to look for Sanyang Xuanhuo.
哈哈哈，不错，我果然没看错人。¤Hahaha, yes, I didn't see the wrong person as expected.
不须多时，一抹跃动的金红火焰进入你的视野，看来那便是三阳玄火不错了。¤It doesn't take long for a pulsating golden red flame to enter your field of vision. It seems that Sanyang Xuanhuo is pretty good.
魏无极神色惶恐，你心知他定是想起了什么，决定按他的吩咐去做。¤Wei Wuji looked terrified, you know that he must have remembered something, so you decide to do what he ordered.
剧烈的疼痛霎时传遍你的四肢百骸，你咬紧牙关，控制灵气朝三阳玄火扑去。时间一点一滴流逝，剧烈的疼痛消磨着你的意志，同异火的斗争却还在继续。¤The severe pain spread across your limbs and corpses instantly. You gritted your teeth and controlled your aura to rush toward the Sanyang Profound Fire. Time passed bit by bit, and the severe pain wasted your will, but the struggle with different fires Still going on.
跳进去的一瞬你才发现，这根本不是什么岩浆，而是浓郁得近乎粘稠的火灵气！¤Only when you jumped in did you realize that this is not magma at all, but a thick and nearly viscous fire spirit!
果然如魏无极所说，那三阳玄火入体便不受控制地横冲直撞，若不是雪玉骨参，恐怕你的经脉如今已被它窜成了筛子。¤Sure enough, as Wei Wuji said, the Sanyang Profound Fire entered the body and began to wreck havoc. If it weren't for the Frostbone Ginseng, your body would have quickly been riddled with holes.
你们循着火灵气细溯其源，来到了一处隐蔽的地穴，其中炽红的岩浆缓缓流淌，想来三阳玄火正是在这岩浆中了。¤You follow the fire spirit to trace its source, and you come to a hidden crypt, in which red magma flows slowly. It is in this magma that you want to come to Sanyang Xuanhuo.
快走，快走！退出这片地方我再和你说！¤Go, go! I'll tell you when I exit this place!
不知过了多久，三阳玄火终于停止挣扎，任由你纳入丹田。你松了口气，昏死过去。¤I don't know how long it took, Sanyang Xuanhuo finally stopped struggling and let you be included in the Dantian. You breathed a sigh of relief and passed out.
不过此物无法庇护你的丹田，炼化之时烈火焚神，你必定要经历一番极其难耐的折磨，若无法坚守灵台清明即刻便会殒命于这霸道的火焰中，你可决定好了？¤But this thing can't protect your dantian. The fire burns the gods during refining. You will have to experience an extremely intolerable torture. If you can't hold on to the spiritual platform, you will be killed in this overbearing flame immediately. You can decide. ?
你既已准备好雪玉骨参，与这三阳玄火斗争便可多上几分保障。¤Now that you have prepared the Frostbone Ginseng, you can have a little more protection against the fight with the Sanyang Profound Flame.
你加快速度，上前将那异火攫入掌中，跃出火池开始炼化。¤You speed up, step forward and grab the strange fire into your palm, jump out of the fire pool and start refining.
我决定好了，修仙本就风险诸多，怎可贪图一时安逸而放弃精进实力的机会？¤I've decided. There are many risks in cultivating immortals. How can you give up the opportunity to improve your strength in the hope of a moment of ease?
多年前我与那离火门前掌门斗法时似乎见他用过类似的功法...约莫取自于......¤Years ago, when I was fighting with the head of Heavenly Fire Gate, I seemed to have seen him use a similar technique...something from...
洞窟里的这片土地似乎分外荒凉。裸露的砂石上寸草不生，寸寸土地呈皲裂的趋势向外延伸，你跋涉数十里，也难以觅得水灵气与木灵气，就连金灵气也十分稀薄。¤The land in the cave seems extremely desolate. There is no grass growing on the exposed sand and stone, and every inch of the ground shows a tendency to crack and extend outwards. If you travel for dozens of miles, it is difficult to find water aura and wood aura. Thin.
这气息似曾相识...待我仔细想想。¤This breath seems familiar... wait for me to think about it.
再睁眼时已是两月后，魏无极漂浮在离你不远的地方替你望风。幸好巫山荒凉无比，你所处的地方又是偏僻的角落，这两月竟无人前来。¤It was already two months later when I opened my eyes again, and Wei Wuji was floating not far from you to watch the wind for you. Fortunately, Wushan is extremely desolate, and the place you are in is a remote corner. No one has been here in these two months.
孰知这异火一进丹田便似蛟龙入海，一瞬间点燃了你丹田内浩瀚的气海！¤Do you know that when this strange fire enters the pubic field, it is like a dragon entering the sea, and it ignited the vast sea of ​​air in your pubic field in an instant!
你继续在这片荒芜的土地上探索，想要寻找造成这里火灵气与土灵气旺盛的原因。¤You continue to explore this barren land, trying to find the reason for the strong fire and earth aura here.
先前涂抹的雪玉骨参此时发挥了作用，丝丝寒凉之气缓解了火池的高温，你忍受着轻微的灼痛向灵力波动最强的地方游去。¤The Frostbone Ginseng that was applied earlier has taken effect, and the cold air relieved the high temperature in the fire pool. You endured a slight burning pain and swam to the place with the strongest spiritual power fluctuations.
极阴冷火可护住你的经脉不受侵害，不过却无法庇护你的丹田，炼化之时烈火焚神，你必定要经历一番极其难耐的折磨，若无法坚守灵台清明即刻便会殒命于这霸道的火焰中，你可决定好了？¤The extremely yin and cold fire can protect your meridians from infringement, but it cannot protect your dantian. During the refining process, the fire burns the gods. You must experience an extremely difficult torment. If you can't hold on to the spiritual platform, you will die immediately. In this domineering flame, have you decided?
老头儿，你能看出什么门道吗？¤Old man, can you see any way?
先前催动的极阴冷火此时发挥了作用，丝丝寒凉之气缓解了火池的高温，你忍受着轻微的灼痛向灵力波动最强的地方游去。¤The extremely yin and cold fire that had been urged earlier came into play at this time, and the cold air alleviated the high temperature in the fire pool. You endured a slight burning pain and swam to the place with the strongest spiritual fluctuations.
你控制药液包裹身躯，毫不犹豫地投身岩浆中。¤You control the liquid medicine to wrap your body and plunge into the magma without hesitation.
我还没收集到雪玉骨参，也没修练过极阴冷火，还是做好准备再来吧。¤I haven't collected Frostbone Ginseng, nor have I cultivated the extreme cold fire, so I'd better be prepared to come again.
果然如魏无极所说，那三阳玄火入体便不受控制地横冲直撞，若不是极阴冷火，恐怕你的经脉如今已被它窜成了筛子。¤Sure enough, as Wei Wuji said, the Sanyang Xuanhuo would rampage uncontrollably when it entered the body. If it weren't for the extremely cold and cold fire, I'm afraid your meridians have now been sifted by it.
仿佛有什么奇特的力量将周围的水灵气与木灵气吞噬殆尽一般，你对这股力量的源头心生好奇，也不知是否是什么天材地宝引动了这般异象。¤It seems that some peculiar power has swallowed up the surrounding water aura and wood aura. You are curious about the source of this power, and you don't know whether it is the treasure of heaven and earth that caused such a vision.
你控制极阴冷火包裹身躯，毫不犹豫地投身岩浆中。¤You control the extremely cold and cold fire to wrap your body and plunge into the magma without hesitation.
为此物冒如此风险倒也不值，我们还是离开吧。¤It's not worth taking such a risk for this thing, let's leave.
也罢，也罢。¤Never mind, never mind.
习得：三阳玄火变¤Acquisition: Sanyang Xuanhuo Change
你既已习得极阴冷火，与这三阳玄火斗争便可多上几分保障。¤Now that you have learned the extremely cold and cold fire, you can get a little more protection from the struggle with these three yang mysterious fires.
雪玉骨参不可直接服用，你先以真火烧灼盛放药材的寒玉盒，将其凝练成药液。¤Frostbone Ginseng cannot be taken directly, you must first heat the jade box containing the herb with your inner fire to condense it into a medicinal solution.
三阳玄火！¤Sanyang Xuanhuo!
强忍着拓宽经脉的苦楚，你以体内灵气缓慢地引导异火去往丹田的位置以便炼化。¤Forcibly enduring the pain of widening the meridians, you slowly guide the different fire to the position of the dantian with the spiritual energy in your body for refining.
怪事，我怎么闲来无事与离火门前掌门斗上法了？¤Weird thing, how come I have nothing to do with the boss in front of the Heavenly Fire Gate?
嗯？这地方...¤Huh? This place...
或许取自于...¤Maybe from...
先想想关键的事，这功法取自于何物你可还没说呢！¤Think about the key thing first. You haven't said what this technique is derived from!
你简单的调息后便再次踏上了旅途。¤After a simple breath adjustment, you set off on the journey again.
你遵循魏无极的指示用真火包裹住莹白的雪玉骨参，炽热的火焰逐渐将药材融化，最终在玉盒中化为一滩剔透的液体。¤You follow Wei Wuji's instructions to wrap the white snow jade bone ginseng with real fire. The hot flame gradually melts the medicinal materials, and finally turns into a puddle of transparent liquid in the jade box.
我的修为不足，还是不要贸然行事了。¤My cultivation is not enough, so don't act rashly.
你眼见魏无极面色一变，连元神都摇晃了几分。¤When you see Wei Wuji's expression change, even the soul is shaken a bit.
是否前往古位面？{w}{w=0.5}¤Are you heading to the Ancient Plane? {w}{w=0.5}
你刚踏出没几步，突然便有一股巨力裹挟着你向远处飞去。¤You have just taken a few steps, and suddenly a huge force wrapped around you and sent you flying off into the distance.
你艰难地在时空乱流间寻找前进的道路，突然有一物从你身边坠落。你下意识地伸手将其捞住，竟是一只通体碧绿的储物袋，其上以精细的金线绣出“竹”的字样。¤You are struggling to find your way through the space-time turbulence, when suddenly something falls from your side. You subconsciously reach out and grab it, but it's a turquoise storage pouch with the word Bamboo embroidered in fine gold thread.
你四下环视，想要找出储物袋的主人。只见远方似是竹山宗长老的人正在混乱的时空中穿梭而去，从背影看来或许是竹山宗的碧宵道人...¤You look around, trying to find the owner of the pouch. Only to see the far side seems to be the Bamboo Mountain Sect elders are chaotic space and time shuttle and go, from the back looks like perhaps the Bamboo Mountain Sect's Biyang Daoist ...
你把储物袋揣进怀中，打算日后相见时再将其物归原主。¤You put the storage bag into your arms, and intend to meet later to return it to its original owner.
反正碧宵长老也不知道这东西掉到哪里了，如此这般也算是缘分，我就不客气地收下了。¤Anyway, Elder Lantern does not know where this thing fell, so this is also considered fate, I will politely accept it.
这...这是？¤This... This is?
嗯...这看起来可不像普通的陨母...莫非这是...{color=#d0380a}太玄晶{/color}！？¤Hmm... This doesn't look like an ordinary meteorite mother... Could it be that this is... {color=#d0380a}Taixuan Crystal{/color}!
没想到竟能在这乱流之中找到此等宝物...不过若非我体道修为大成，即便认出了这太玄晶恐怕也难以脱离乱流的裹挟来到此地...¤I didn't expect to find such treasures in this turbulence... However, if I hadn't achieved great success in my body dao, even if I had recognized this Taixuan Crystal, I would not have been able to break away from the turbulence and come here...
哈哈哈，机缘总是留给有准备之人的。小心收好此物吧，在宁州可找不到这般品质的炼器材料。¤Hahaha, chance is always reserved for those who are prepared. Be careful to keep this object, you can't find this quality of refining material in Ning Province.
机会难得，我们多多留意一番，看能不能多找到一些这样的材料。¤It's a rare opportunity, let's keep an eye out and see if we can find some more of these materials.
运气不错，这陨母可是一种极为稀有的炼器材料，据说只有在这样的空间裂隙中才比较容易找到。¤Good luck, this meteorite mother is an extremely rare material for refining, and it is said that it is easier to find only in such a spatial rift.
这是...？¤This is...?
乱流裹挟着一块其貌不扬的精石从你附近飞过，你下意识地抓了一块到手里，只觉得手心一丝凉意传来，让你不经打了个寒颤。¤The turbulence wrapped around a piece of unattractive essence stone flew past near you, you subconsciously grabbed a piece into your hand, only to feel a trace of coolness coming from your palm, making you shiver.
是否前往古原城？{w}{w=0.5}¤Is it heading to Gohara City? {w}{w=0.5}
你堪堪避开，却只见一人像野兽般横冲直撞着向你扑了过来！¤You can avoid it, but only to see a man rampaging towards you like a wild animal!
{vpunch=10,0.5}轰！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Boom!
想到这一点，你仔细地观察着洞内灵气的走向，发现它们正朝着更深的地方汇聚。¤Thinking about this, you carefully observe the direction of the auras inside the cave and find that they are converging towards a deeper place.
一踏入此地，灼热的气浪席卷而来。温度极高的熔岩池不停地冒着气泡，赤红火光燃亮整个洞窟。巨大的石钟乳和石笋遍布溶洞，表面闪烁着一圈圈红色的光芒，就连洞内的岩石都呈出绚烂的金红色。¤As soon as you step into this place, waves of searing heat sweep over you. The extremely hot lava pools keep bubbling and the crimson fire lights up the entire cave. Huge stalactites and stalagmites are scattered all over the cave, the surface of which glows in a circle of red, and even the rocks inside the cave have a brilliant golden red color.
你被这壮阔的奇观所惊艳，不禁停下了前进的脚步。¤You are so amazed by this magnificent spectacle that you can't help but stop moving forward.
既有奇观...那应当也有奇物伴生才对！¤There are both wonders... Then there should also be something strange to accompany it!
好热...！¤It's hot...!
你手脚利落地取走一半赤火元铜精，离开了溶洞。¤You sharply take half of the Red Fire Yuan Copper Essence and leave the cave.
你面露喜色，赤火元铜精乃是极为难得的矿石，虽与火铜同源，但赤火元铜精只在地火中才有几率孕育。¤You look happy, red fire copper essence is an extremely rare ore, although the same source as fire copper, but red fire copper essence only in the ground fire has a chance to breed.
即便用不上，以此物同其他修士换取所求的材料也是绝佳的选择。¤Even if you can't use it, it's an excellent choice to exchange it with other cultivators for the material you're looking for.
那金属看起来与火铜相似，但颜色却不同于火铜污浊的暗红，而是如火般亮眼的鲜红。¤The metal looks similar to fire copper, but the color is different from the fire copper dirty dark red, but as bright as fire bright red.
难道这是...赤火元铜精！¤Could this be... Red fire yuan copper essence!
顶着炽灼的热浪来到洞窟深处，一簇奇异的金属吸引了你的目光。¤Coming deeper into the cave against the blazing heat, a cluster of strange metal catches your eye.
你将其收入密闭的木盒中，转身离开了此地。¤You put it into a closed wooden box, turn around and leave the place.
曾经听说有种名为炼心芝的五品草药，其气味诡异无比，可令闻者沉迷幻象无法自拔，或许正是此草。¤I once heard that there is a fifth-grade herb called the Heartrend Shroom, whose smell is so bizarre that it can induce severe hallucination that can be impossible to extricate onself from, perhaps it is this herb.
最终，你在一块横倒在丛林的朽木背面发现了一朵灵芝状的灵草，那令人产生幻觉的香气正是从此草中散出。¤In the end, you found a lingzhi-like herb on the back of a rotten tree that had fallen across the jungle, and it was from this herb that the hallucinogenic aroma emanated.
摆脱幻象后，你重新在此地追寻着香气的源头。¤After getting rid of the hallucination, you resume your search for the source of the aroma in this place.
你很快便意识到这是受到那香气影响产生的幻觉，这种程度的幻象对与心性坚定的你并没有太大的影响。¤You soon realize that this is a hallucination influenced by the aroma, this level of illusion does not have much effect on you with a strong mind.
你这{xiaozi}，心性还是不够坚定啊...¤You {xiaozi}, the mind is still not strong enough ah ...
眼前的景象仿佛有着奇特的吸引力，你不可自拔地徜徉烂漫的花海中。陡然间猛烈的刺痛从你识海中扩散开来，你甩了甩头摆脱那股令人不适的晕眩感，却发现面前哪有什么盛放的鲜花，只是一片枯腐的树木罢了！¤The scene in front of you seems to have a strange attraction, you can't help but wander in the sea of rosy flowers. A sudden fierce tingle spread from your consciousness, you shake your head to get rid of the discomforting dizziness, but found that there is no blooming flowers in front of you, just a piece of dead and decaying trees!
那芬芳的气味令你心驰神远，一瞬间眼前的山洞似乎变得迷蒙起来，心神微动间此处已化作绚烂的花海。¤The fragrant smell makes your heart race, and for a moment the cave in front of you seems to become misty, with a slight movement of the mind the place has turned into a gorgeous sea of flowers.
醉人的馥郁香气侵袭了你的感官，清润的幽香将你这几天来的疲累一扫而净。¤The intoxicating fragrance assaults your senses, and the refreshing fragrance sweeps away your fatigue of the past few days.
不知道是何物在此制造幻境...¤I don't know what is creating the illusion here...
你有些恼怒地瞪向古剑，不曾想锋利可鉴的剑锋上竟映出一道虚晃的人影！心神大惊间你向侧方扑去，术法的光芒与你擦身而过，将石壁轰出深深的裂痕。{vpunch=10,0.5}¤You glare at the ancient sword with some irritation, but you don't expect the sharp blade to reflect a shadowy figure! The light of the spell brushes against you, blasting deep cracks into the stone wall. The light of the spell brushed against you, blasting deep cracks in the stone wall.
不错，有两下子，那就看看这下你还有没有那么幸运能躲过去！¤Not bad, you have a couple of moves, so let's see if you'll be so lucky to dodge it this time!
背后的古剑沉默着，魏无极一反常态地没有及时解答你的问题。¤The ancient sword behind you is silent, and Wei Wuji uncharacteristically does not answer your question in time.
你飞速地在脑海里搜索着相关的记忆，迫切地想要找出血符的用途，但对于这些歪门邪道的符箓你知之甚少，一时也想不出这东西的用途。¤You quickly searched your mind for relevant memories, desperately trying to find the purpose of the blood talisman, but you know very little about these crooked talismans, and could not think of the use of this thing for a while.
血煞符！¤Bloodshed Talisman!
你轻身提气，蹑手蹑脚地跟了上去，昏暗的石道里你紧盯着前方晃动不停的黑色影子。那人影时不时地弯下腰去，似乎依旧在沿途布置以鲜血绘成的符箓。¤You lightly lift your breath and tiptoe up the dimly lit stone pathway as you stare at the black shadow swaying in front of you. The figure bends down every now and then, and seems to be still arranging the talisman painted in blood along the way.
魏老，你能看出这东西什么来路吗？¤Wei Lao, you can see what this thing came from?
潜伏之际本就精神紧张，突如其来的一声大喝令你变貌失色，险些暴露行踪。¤Lurking when the spirit is already tense, a sudden bellow makes you change appearance and lose color, nearly exposing your whereabouts.
你隐隐察觉到一丝危险的气息，或许之后遇到化尘教之人再徐徐图之吧。¤You vaguely perceive a hint of danger, perhaps after encountering the people of the Dust Transformation Cult and then slowly figure it out.
前方拐角处的人影似乎已经消失，你对此事感到蹊跷，决定跟上前一探究竟。¤The figure around the corner seems to have disappeared, and you feel strange about this, so you decide to follow it and find out.
你隐隐察觉到一丝阴谋的气息，还是待离开宁州古迹后再徐徐图之吧。¤You faintly sense a hint of intrigue, so perhaps you should wait until you leave the Ning Province monument.
不知此人实力如何，你决定......¤Not knowing how strong this person is, you decide to ......
你悄无声息地跟在他身后，在他走入下一个拐角时屈身上前，观察他留在路边的印记。¤You follow him silently, bending forward as he walks around the next corner and observing the markings he left on the roadside.
以鲜血描绘的符箓依旧透着鲜艳的色彩，边缘甚至还有血痕缓缓向下流去，看来并非是他驻存的血液。¤The talisman depicted in blood is still permeated with bright colors, and there are even blood marks slowly flowing downward around the edges, which do not appear to be his resident blood.
若是新鲜的血液...这位化尘教弟子怕是刚到宁州古迹便残害同门取其血液，不似什么善类。¤If it was fresh blood... The dust transformation sect disciple is afraid that just arrived at the Ning Province monument will be brutalized fellow disciples to take their blood, not like any good.
你运起遁术，几下追上前方修士的脚步。只见另一位化尘教修士沿途布置着以血刻画的符箓，行迹十分诡异。¤You transported the art, a few times to catch up with the footsteps of the cultivator ahead. I just saw another dust-transforming sect cultivator along the way arranged with blood-engraved talismans, the trail is very strange.
行至道路深处，忽见一位化尘教弟子尸横路边，而前方一抹土黄色衣角闪过。¤To the depth of the road, suddenly see a dust sect disciple corpse on the side of the road, and in front of a smear of earth yellow clothing flashed.
你认为事出反常必有妖，还是不要太过好奇为妙。¤You think that there must be a demon in the opposite direction, or do not be too curious.
你追寻着微弱的香气，那味道隐隐地吸引你向南边走去。¤You trace the faint aroma that vaguely draws you to the south.
奇异的香味吸引着你，那股香气的源头究竟是...？¤The strange scent draws you in. What is the source of that fragrance...?
恐怕附近的人也都注意到了，但能够解开一切谜团的钥匙或许就在这里，小心行事吧。¤I'm afraid everyone nearby has noticed it, but the key to unlocking all the mysteries may be here, so act carefully.
没想到竟引来如此天地异象...那里到底有什么东西？¤I didn't expect to attract such a heaven and earth phenomenon... What the hell is in there?
看，在那里。¤Look, there it is.
而魏无极先前凝视的地方，一道绚烂无比的恢弘光柱冲天而起，已经安定下来的铁剑也重新发出了微弱的嗡鸣。¤And where Wei Wuji had previously gazed, a splendid and incomparable pillar of magnificent light shot up into the sky, and the iron sword that had settled down reemitted a faint humming sound.
你来不及过多思索，将体内的灵气一股脑输进朴素无华的剑身里。随着灵气的注入，铁剑震动渐弱，逐渐归于平静。¤You can't think too much about it, and infuse the spiritual qi in your body into the plain, unadorned sword body. With the infusion of spiritual energy, the iron sword vibration gradually weakens and gradually returns to calm.
快！向剑里注入灵气！¤Quickly! Inject the aura into the sword!
很快地，他将视线转回铁剑，双手掐指成诀，飞速地吟念着你听不懂的咒语。¤Quickly, he turned his eyes back to the iron sword, and with both hands, he chanted an incantation that you could not understand.
伴随着嗡嗡的剑吟声，魏无极的身形逐渐显现。他的目光落向远处的平地，仿佛那里有什么正要发生似的。¤Along with the humming sound of the sword chant, Wei Wuji's figure gradually emerged. His gaze fell to the flat ground in the distance, as if something was about to happen there.
你一靠近此地，背后的铁剑便像是受到什么共鸣般，剧烈地震动起来。¤As soon as you got close to this place, the iron sword behind you vibrated violently as if it was resonating with something.
在这宁州古迹中你并不打算多管闲事，不管那人是谁，都与你没关系。¤You don't intend to meddle in this Ning Province monument, and whoever that person is, it's none of your business.
你轻身提气，在断壁残垣的遮掩下向交谈处靠拢。那几人已因言语不和大打出手，在纷乱的神通中，你依稀辨别出其中二位联手攻击的修士正是当年你在九嶷山所遇的黑心老人。¤You lightly lift your breath and lean toward the conversation under the cover of the broken wall. The men had already fought over words, and amidst the chaos of divine powers, you vaguely discerned that two of the cultivators who had joined forces to attack were none other than the Blackhearted Old Man you had met back in Jiuyi Mountain.
哼，若我还是以前的修为，还轮得到你等小儿在我面前放肆？¤Hmph, if I still had the same cultivation level as before, it would still be your turn to be reckless in front of me, you and other children?
昔日的大护法也不过如此，接招吧！¤How underwhelming, the Great Guardian of the past, take this!
一处破损的民宅内隐隐传来交谈的声音，你屏息倾听片刻，只觉其中一人嗓音听来有些许熟悉之感。你决定...¤You hold your breath and listen for a moment, only to find that one of the voices sounded slightly familiar. You decide...
凭你现在的修为，你以为能拿我二人如何！还是束手就擒交出嗜血珠吧，哈哈！¤With your current level of cultivation, you think you can do anything to us! Or hand over the bloodthirsty pearl, haha!
我左你右，速战速决。¤My left and your right, quick battle.
不错，既然有这个缘分，我再帮你一次又如何。¤Not bad, since there is this destiny, I will help you again.
几位道友打得倒是热闹，也算我一个怎么样？¤How about a few of you are having a good fight, how about counting me in too?
竟然是你！¤It's you!
那三人之战愈演愈烈，你在一旁静静等待他们灵气耗尽之时。但你的如意算盘没过多久便落了空，与黑心老人对立的二人并不像表面看来那么简单。¤The battle of those three is getting more and more intense, and you are waiting quietly on the sidelines for them to run out of aura. The two people who are opposed to the Black Heart Elder are not as simple as they seem.
一阵简短而诡秘的诵唱后，那二人的法宝竟发出璀璨的血光，逐渐合为一柄巨大的重剑。宽厚的剑刃横扫而下，似黄浪般的尘土翻涌而起。待烟尘弥散后，那两位修士与黑心老人一同消失在了你的视野中。¤After a short and secretive chanting, the two's magic treasures actually emitted a bright blood light, gradually merging into a huge heavy sword. The wide and thick blade swept down, and the yellow wave-like dust swept up. After the smoke and dust dissipated, the two cultivators disappeared from your view along with the black heart old man.
居然是这老头儿...依我看这两人在他手中也讨不了什么好，不如我黄雀在后，待他们力竭之时将其一网打尽！¤It was actually this old man... I think these two in his hands will not be able to get any good, why not I yellow bird in the back, when they are exhausted to kill them all!
当年之事也算是互惠互利，如今在这宁州古迹中相逢，也算是一种缘分。¤The incident back then was also considered mutually beneficial, and now we meet in this Ning Province monument, it is also a kind of destiny.
言罢，倪旭欣伸手便去推那灯台。沉重的机栝运动声过后，你二人脚下的地面突然向下沉去。意识到危机的你瞬时反应过来，想要以遁术腾空而起。¤After saying that, Ni XuXin reached out to push the lampstand. After the heavy sound of the machine's movement, the ground beneath your feet suddenly sinks downward. Realizing the crisis, you instantly reacted and tried to get up in the air with the evasion technique.
但洞口处传来的吸力令你无法逃离，你猛地想起宁州古迹为空间错乱之地，恐怕机关通往的另一方早就发生异变...此次探险，实在不知是福是祸。¤But the suction force coming from the entrance of the cave makes you unable to escape. You suddenly remember that the Ning Province monument is a place of spatial disorder, and you are afraid that the other side of the organ has already undergone a mutation... This adventure is really not sure whether it is a blessing or a curse.
这灯台似乎有些奇怪，大抵是居住在古原城的前人为宅邸设下的机关，不知道地图所指示的是否就是这个。¤There seems to be something strange about this lampstand. It is probably a mechanism set up for the mansion by the previous people living in Gubara City, and you wonder if this is what the map indicates.
定是如此！说不定这机关背后便藏着上古时期的宝物！¤It must be so! Maybe behind this mechanism lies a treasure from the ancient times!
怎么了，{FirstName}{xiongdi}有何发现？¤What's up, {FirstName}{xiongdi} what did you find?
你二人搜寻许久也未有收获，正准备放弃之时，你隐约瞥见废墟里依旧挺立的灯台。¤The two of you searched for a long time without any luck, and were about to give up when you vaguely glimpsed the lampstand still standing in the ruins.
周围的物品均受当年战斗波及，即使侥幸不曾受损，也绝不会岿然不动地立在原地。你有些好奇地走上前去轻轻推动灯台，果然如你所想，这灯台早被固定在此处。¤The items around it were affected by the battle back then, and even if they were lucky enough not to have been damaged, they would never have stood still in place. You are a little curious to go forward to gently push the lampstand, as you thought, the lampstand has been fixed in place.
既然如此，我们也只能分头找找此地的可疑之处了。¤Since this is the case, we can only split up to look for suspicious places here.
你与倪旭欣分头行动，开始寻找附近疑似机关或暗道入口的地方。但宁州古迹本就为上古大城，区域内有着数量可观的残破建筑，想要找到线索相当不易。¤You and Ni XuXin split up and start looking for nearby suspected organs or secret entrances. But the Ning Province monument is originally a large ancient city, the area has a considerable number of dilapidated buildings, it is not easy to find clues.
我只看是个与宝图相仿的东西便高价收来了...那修士也不曾告知此处究竟有甚么奥秘......¤I only saw a similar to the treasure map and received it at a high price... The cultivator also did not tell what mystery there is here ......
你们沿着标记一路小心前行。¤You follow the markings carefully along the way.
倪兄可知此地埋藏了何种宝物？¤Do you know what kind of treasures are buried here?
倪旭欣有些羞赧地挠了挠头，露出一副十分懊悔的模样来。¤Ni XuXin scratched his head with a bit of shame, showing a very remorseful look.
从地图绘制的路线来看，似乎就是这里了。¤From the route drawn on the map, it seems to be here.
哈哈，多年未见倪兄热衷冒险的爱好还是未曾改变。也罢，那我便再陪倪兄走上一遭。¤Haha, I haven't seen Brother Ni's passion for adventure for many years, but he still hasn't changed. Then I will accompany brother Ni to walk again.
无碍无碍，那我便自己前去一探究竟！¤I'll go and find out for myself!
我此次前来还有要事在身，怕是不能与你一同前往此处，望倪兄海涵。¤I'm afraid I can't go with you to this place because I have important things to do, so I hope you'll bear with me.
这种粗制滥造的地图令你疑心大作，想起之前遭遇的种种事件，你决定...¤This kind of crude map makes you suspicious, remembering all the incidents you encountered before, you decided to...
果然是你，{FirstName}{LastName}{xiongdi}！¤It's really you, {FirstName}{LastName}{xiongdi}!
方才在此处我远远地看过来就觉得像你，才冒昧喊声留步，如此看来我俩果然缘分匪浅！¤I felt like you when I looked over here from afar, so I took the liberty of shouting to stay, so it seems that we are really destined to be together!
不瞒{xiongdi}，我为此次古迹探险做了许多准备，这地图便是前日所获之物。¤I'm not going to lie {xiongdi}, I've made a lot of preparations for this exploration of the monuments, and this map is what I got the day before.
你接过倪旭欣递来的地图，劣质青玉制成的玉简上歪歪斜斜地刻着路线，道路尽头标注的暗红色X印记肮脏无比，勉强能看出似乎是用了朱笔之类的东西绘制而成。¤You took the map handed to you by Ni XuXin, the poor quality green jade jade sketch with the route skewed, the dark red X mark at the end of the road was dirty, you could barely tell that it seemed to be drawn with something like a vermilion pen.
你有些好奇倪旭欣喊住你的原因，于是慢下脚步等待他追上来。¤You are somewhat curious as to why Ni XuXin called out to you, and slow down to wait for him to catch up.
你不太关心声音的主人出于什么原因让你留步，只希望能在他认出你前离开此地。¤You don't really care what reason the owner of the voice has for you to stay, you just hope to get out of here before he recognizes you.
你听到身后传来有些熟悉的声音，于是...¤You hear a somewhat familiar voice from behind you and...
道友留步！¤Friends of Taoism stay!
难道这就是古籍中提到的阴阳黄泉花...？¤Could this be the Flower of Samsara mentioned in the ancient texts...?
这是...重元换血草！¤This is... Flower of Undeath!
一株鲜红色的仙草在石缝中迎风摇曳。¤A bright red immortal grass is swaying in the wind in the stone crevice.
一座破败的多宝塔，没什么值得在意的地方。¤A decrepit multi-purpose pagoda, nothing worth caring about.
你与百里奇在此唏嘘一番错失宝物的遗憾后分道扬镳，去追寻各自的机缘。¤You and Bailiqi part ways here after sighing with regret at missing a treasure, to pursue their own chances.
你回忆起许久前在御剑门深处遇见的那柄魔剑，那气息与此处残留的煞气竟有几分相似。¤You recall the demonic sword you met long ago deep in the Imperial Sword Sect, the aura of which is somewhat similar to the fierce aura remaining here.
说来巧合，那法宝也是柄飞剑，不知此处阵法中凶戾的剑灵是否和这被取走的剑有所关系。¤Coincidentally, that magic treasure is also a flying sword, I wonder if the fierce sword spirit in the formation here is related to the sword that was taken away.
我也不曾见过，想不到这破塔中竟还封印着此等奇物，若有机会真想见识一下。¤I've never seen it before, I never thought there would be such a strange thing sealed in this broken tower, if I had the chance I would really like to see it.
你们追寻煞气的源头，却只发现了一处残损的阵法。阵法中一处狭长剑型的凹陷如今已空空如也，只有浓烈的煞气依旧残存其中。¤You have traced the source of the fatal energy, but only found a damaged formation. A narrow, sword-shaped depression in the formation is now empty, and only the strong fierce Qi still remains in it.
从形状看来，这阵法以前或许封印着某把灵剑，只是不知何等奇物竟能留下如此亘久不散的煞气......¤From the shape, this formation may have sealed a spiritual sword, but I don't know what kind of strange things can leave such a long time of the fierce aura ......
倒是稀奇，我还未曾见过满溢煞气的法宝。¤It is rare, I have never seen a magic treasure overflowing with fierce qi.
我倒是有缘见识过与之相似的法宝......¤I have had the chance to see a similar magic treasure ......
沿着坑坑洼洼的石阶登上阁楼，一股强烈的煞气袭面而来。¤Ascending the potholed stone steps to the attic, a strong fierce fierce aura came to my face.
你们合力破除了剑阵，塔的最高层看起来愈发破旧，四处都是散落的砖石碎块。¤You have combined your efforts to break the sword formation, the highest floor of the tower looks more and more dilapidated, and there are scattered masonry fragments everywhere.
你拜别百里奇，决心去探索宁州古迹其他的地方。¤You bid farewell to Bailiqi and resolve to explore the rest of the Ning Province monuments.
待体悟过后，百里奇决意把阵法破掉，去更高的地方一探究竟。你对于塔的上层...{w}{w=0.5}¤After the realization, Bailiqi is determined to break the formation and go to a higher place to explore. You are interested in the upper levels of the tower... {w}{w=0.5}
你隐隐感到剑灵中传来熟悉的气息，而这气息的源头也许正是你背上的那柄铁剑。¤You vaguely feel a familiar aura coming from the sword spirit, and the source of that aura may be the very same iron sword on your back.
你对体修之道没什么兴趣，婉言拒绝了百里奇的邀约，只是在一旁观战片刻。¤You have little interest in the way of physical cultivation and politely declined Bailiqi's invitation to just watch the battle from the sidelines for a few moments.
你飞身入阵，同百里奇一齐在飞剑的攻势下体悟道意。演练片刻后，你感到自己的体道有所提升。同时，你隐隐感到剑灵中传来熟悉的气息，而这气息的源头也许正是你背上的那柄铁剑。¤You flew into the formation, and together with Bailiqi, you realized the dao meaning under the attack of the flying sword. After a few moments of practice, you feel that your body dao has improved. At the same time, you faintly feel a familiar aura coming from the sword spirit, and the source of this aura may be the iron sword on your back.
你决定......{w}{w=0.5}¤You decide ...... {w}{w=0.5}
察觉到你的气息，那位修士转过身来，此人正是你在宁州的旧识——百里奇。。¤Noticing your breath, that cultivator turns around, and this person is none other than your old acquaintance in Ning Province - Baili Qi.
百里兄明明有破阵的实力，为何还要与这飞剑过多纠缠？¤Baili brother obviously has the strength to break the formation, why do you want to tangle too much with this flying sword?
哈哈哈哈，{FirstName}{xiongdi}有所不知，我准备借助此地的剑阵磨炼自己的体术。若{FirstName}{xiongdi}有兴趣，倒可以入阵一起推演一番！¤Hehehe, {FirstName}{xiongdi} doesn't know this but, I'm going to use the formation here to temper my body. If {FirstName}{xiongdi} is interested, you can enter the formation with me and we can train together!
哈哈哈哈，道友有所不知，我准备借助此地的剑阵磨炼自己的体术。若你有兴趣，倒可以入阵一起推演一番！¤Haha, I'm ready to use the formation here to refine my body further and deepen my understanding of the Body Dao, if you're interested you can join me; maybe you'll be able to deduce something!
百里道友明明有破阵的实力，为何还要与这飞剑过多纠缠？¤Daoist Baili clearly has the strength to break the formation, why do you want to tangle too much with this flying sword?
你观战片刻，隐隐感到剑灵中传来熟悉的气息，而这气息的源头也许正是你背上的那柄铁剑。¤You watched the battle for a moment, you vaguely felt a familiar aura coming from the sword spirit, and the source of this aura may be the iron sword on your back.
察觉到你的气息，那位修士转过身来，冷冷地注视着你。你看清他的面容，此人正是宁州赫赫有名的体修——百里奇。似乎是感觉到你并没有恶意，他又沉浸到与剑灵交手的快意中。¤Sensing your breath, the cultivator turns around and gazes at you coldly. You see his face clearly, this person is none other than Ning Province's famous body cultivator - Baili Qi. Seemingly sensing that you are not malicious, he indulges in the pleasure of fighting with the sword spirit again.
燥动的血色剑芒在阵法中跳跃回转，而阵法中央似乎有位修士正徒手与这些飞剑交战。¤The dry, blood-colored swords jump and turn in the formation, and there seems to be a cultivator in the center of the formation who is fighting these flying swords with his bare hands.
一踏入此塔，你便听闻塔上传来一阵阵低沉的剑鸣。你踏上有些破败的石梯，一步一步朝着更高层走去。¤As soon as you step into this tower, you hear a low sound of swords coming from the tower. You step onto the somewhat dilapidated stone staircase and walk step by step towards the higher levels.
这塔如此破败，想来应该也没什么好东西了。¤This tower is so dilapidated, so I guess there is nothing good left.
并不算高的多宝塔，经历正魔大战的洗礼后愈发破败，可以看到其上破损的屋檐以及塌陷的墙体。{w}{w=0.5}¤The not-so-high Multi Treasure Tower, which has become more and more dilapidated after experiencing the baptism of the Great War of the Righteous Demons, can be seen with its broken eaves and collapsed walls. {w}{w=0.5}
你的神识敏锐地捕捉到一丝微弱的波动...这感觉如此微弱，若非你神识修为极深，恐怕也难以发现。¤Your soul sense keenly captured a faint fluctuation ... This feeling is so faint, if not for your soul sense cultivation is extremely deep, I'm afraid it is difficult to find.
这莫非便是传闻中提到的那块记录着化神秘术《意守法》的石碑...¤This could be the stone tablet that records the 《Yi Gui Fa》, the mysterious art of Deity Transformation that was mentioned in the rumors...
这石碑是...？¤This stone tablet is...?
你顺着神识感应的方向小心探索，穿过原本看似死路的残垣断壁，映入眼帘的竟是一块巨大的石碑！¤You explore carefully in the direction of your soul sense, through the ruined walls of what originally looked like a dead end, and what comes into view is a huge stone monument!
你尝试阅读石碑上的文字...或许叫图案更为合适，但完全无法看懂上面都写了些什么。¤You try to read the writing on the tablet... Perhaps it would be more appropriate to call it a pattern, but it is completely impossible to read what is written on it.
你的神识刚一接触石碑，魂魄深处一阵令你颤栗的剧痛传来，随即无数的影像便开始倒灌入你的识海之中。¤As soon as your consciousness touches the tablet, a sharp pain deep in your soul that makes you tremble comes, and then countless images start pouring into your sea of consciousness.
你尝试观察这些出现在你识海之中的影像，但来自魂魄深处的疼痛却也不断加深。好在你的心境早已达到了{color=#d0380a}物我合一{/color}的境界，任何外在苦痛都无法动摇你的心神。¤You try to observe these images that appear in your sea of consciousness, but the pain from the depths of your soul keeps deepening as well. The good thing is that your mind has long reached the realm of {color=#d0380a}unity of things {/color}, and no external pain can shake your mind.
慢慢的，你排除了一切杂念，将意念沉于丹田之中，识海之中的影像也逐渐清晰起来...¤Slowly, you exclude all distracting thoughts, will be sunk in the Dantian, the image in the sea of consciousness also gradually clear up...
习得{color=#d0380a}《意守法》{/color}¤Acquire {color=#d0380a}The Law of Intentional Compliance{/color}
呼...这石碑虽说立就于古原城中央，但若是放在万年前，也不知道要付出怎样的代价才能获得这样感悟的机会。¤Hoo... Although this stone monument is standing in the middle of the ancient original city, but if it was placed ten thousand years ago, I do not know what price to pay to get such an opportunity to feel.
你尝试观察这些出现在你识海之中的影像，但不断加剧的痛苦令你心神动摇，若是再继续保持这种状态，恐怕会落得一个魂飞魄散的下场！¤You try to observe these images that appear in your consciousness, but the increasing pain makes your mind shake, if you continue to maintain this state, I'm afraid you will end up with a soul scattered!
你连忙将神识从石碑上抽离，魂魄深处传来的剧痛与识海中的影像也随之消散。你大口大口的喘着粗气，庆幸自己逃过一劫...¤You hastily pull your divine consciousness away from the tablet, and the sharp pain coming from deep within your soul and the images in your consciousness dissipate. You breathe heavily, thankful that you escaped...
你强忍剧痛，坚持外放神识，如同弓弦般紧绷的神念终于断裂。你眼前一黑，终于昏死过去...¤You endure the pain and insist on releasing your divine consciousness, and your divine mind, which is as taut as a bowstring, finally breaks. You blacked out and finally passed out...
心境+50，神识-1¤Mental State +50, soul sense -1
还是不要再回来了。¤It's better not to come back.
进去看看吧。据我所知，即便未能通过试炼，也只会被传送回殿外，倒是不会有生命危险。¤Go in and take a look. As far as I know, even if you fail to pass the trial, you will only be transported back outside the hall, but not in danger of your life.
看来你应该是在别的地方遇到了什么意外，最后导致变成了现在这样。¤It seems that you should have encountered some accident somewhere else, which eventually led to the current situation.
我当年也对这登仙殿有关的传闻做了不少调查。只是最后不知发生了什么事，并未曾达到此地。¤I also did a lot of research on the rumors related to this Immortal Hall back then. I just don't know what happened in the end, and did not reach this place.
大部分冒险进入古迹之人都是冲着这登仙殿来的，只是这数千年来也未曾听闻有谁成功获得过这份传承。¤Most of the people who ventured into the monuments are rushing to this Hall of Immortality, but these thousands of years have not heard of anyone who has successfully obtained this heritage.
据说这登仙殿是某位飞升仙界的大能所筑，他将自己的功法传承留在这殿内。只要能通过他留下的试炼，就能得到这份传承。¤It is said that this Hall of Immortality was built by a certain ascended immortal power, who left his own legacy of techniques in this hall. As long as you can pass the trial he left behind, you can get this inheritance.
你千年前也来过这登仙殿？¤You also came to this Hall of Immortality a thousand years ago?
这古原城在万年前可称得上是宁州第一大城，吸引无数的修真者来到此地，靠的就是这登仙殿。¤This ancient original city ten thousand years ago can be called the number one city in Ning Province, attracting countless cultivators to this place, relying on this Immortal Hall.
登仙殿...好气派的名字，这里原本会是做什么的？¤Deng Xian Hall... What an imposing name, what could this place be for?
那方正的牌匾并未因战争或时间的消磨黯淡失色，依旧闪烁着璀璨的华光。¤The square plaque has not been dulled by war or the wear and tear of time, but still shines with a brilliant light.
一幢巍峨恢弘的宫殿伫立在道路尽头，以玄玉制成的牌匾上用灵气刻录着“登仙殿”三个大字。¤A majestic palace stood at the end of the road, and the plaque made of Xuan jade had the words Hall of Immortality inscribed on it with aura.
可惜...这登仙殿的试炼只有一次机会。¤Unfortunately... There was only one chance to try out this Immortal Hall.
说时迟那时快，他发出了野兽般的嘶吼声，姿态诡怪地向你奔来！¤As soon as he was done, he let out a beast-like hiss and came running towards you with a strange posture!
吼——¤Roar...
那招式你有所了解，分明是金虹剑派所用神通。没想到此处竟有金虹剑派的修士伏击，你怒不可遏，环视四周寻找着飞剑的主人。¤You know that move, it is clearly the Golden Rainbow Sword School's divine ability. You were not expecting to be ambushed by a Golden Rainbow Sword School cultivator, and you are furious, looking around for the owner of the flying sword.
那御剑之人手法似乎并不高明，你遥遥望去，竟发现他的衣衫也褴褛不堪，整个人呈出一种极其怪异的颓态。¤The man with the sword does not seem to be very skillful, you look away and find that his clothes are also ragged, and the whole person is in an extremely strange state of dishevelment.
一柄沾染着金色灵气的飞剑猛地从侧方窜出，你连忙躲闪。那飞剑从你面前呼啸而过，在空中停顿了片刻，再一次向你袭来！¤A flying sword tainted with golden aura fiercely from the side, you dodged in a hurry. The flying sword whistles past you, pauses in the air for a moment, and comes at you once more!
你收敛气息，慢慢退至远处...¤You restrained your breath and slowly retreated to the distance...
你赶往那里时，不少的修士也正陆陆续续向这里飞来，看来他们也都是被异象吸引而来。¤As you rush there, a number of cultivators are also flying towards the place one after another, and it seems that they are all attracted by the vision as well.
有几人似乎抢先一步来到了这里，此时正在半空之中打转巡视，而其中一人正是你在宁州的旧时相识——公孙季。¤A few people seem to have arrived here ahead of you, and are now cruising around in mid-air, and one of them is your old acquaintance in Ning Province - Gongsun Ji.
不过是一障眼迷阵罢了，只不过设置的颇为精妙，若不是此地异象突显，还真难以注意的到。¤But it is just a blindfold, but the set-up is quite subtle, if not for the vision here, it is really difficult to notice.
此处应该就是异象显现之地，不过一眼看去，什么也看不到。¤This should be the place where the vision appears, but at a glance, nothing can be seen.
你对于阵法之道略有些许研究，但此等复杂的古阵法也未曾见过。一番研究之下仍是一头雾水，只好摇摇头，悻悻然地退到一边。¤You have a little research on the way of formations, but such complex ancient formations have never seen. After some research, I was still confused, so I shook my head and retreated resentfully to the side.
你对于阵法之道知之甚微，虽然有心相助，但一番研究之下仍是一头雾水，只好摇摇头，悻悻然地退到一边。¤You know very little about the way of formation, although the intention to help, but after some research is still confused, can only shake his head, resentful retreat to the side.
足足等待两日后，中心区域突然传来异动。五只石雕兽像缓缓地由地下升起，破开土石的遮掩，显露在人们面前。¤After waiting for two days, there was a sudden movement in the central area. Five stone beast statues slowly rose from the ground, breaking through the cover of earth and stone, revealed in front of people.
你对于阵法之道研究颇深，仔细观察之下，便看出了一些端倪。¤You for the way of formation research is quite deep, under careful observation, then see some clues.
不管这迷阵有何玄妙，闯进去试试便知。¤No matter what the mystery of the formation is, break into it and you will know.
倒也不必，这迷阵虽然难以发现，但真要破解也未必是什么难事。凭此地灵气波动，我便可知晓这障眼迷阵的奥妙。¤It's not necessary, although this maze is difficult to find, but really to break it may not be a difficult task. By the aura fluctuations here, I can know the mystery of this blindfold.
只见公孙季祭出四柄阵旗，掷到四周。一阵灵气波动后，大量的白色雾气竟然凭空出现，一瞬间便将整个地面笼罩于其中。¤Just see Gong Sun Ji sacrificed four formation flags, thrown to the surrounding. After a burst of aura fluctuations, a large amount of white fog appeared out of thin air, a moment will be the whole ground enveloped in it.
这...发生什么了？¤This... What's happening?
有意思，看来这里布下的是一个多重阵法，阵中有阵。¤Interesting, it seems that here is laid a multiple formation, a formation within a formation.
刚刚外围的障眼迷阵好破，不过眼前这些阵法就不那么容易的，恐怕我也要仔细研究一番。¤Just outside the blindfolded maze formation is easy to break, but these formations in front of me is not so easy, I'm afraid I also need to study carefully.
在场的诸位道友，若是有精通于阵法一道的，还请上前一同探讨，或许能加快破除此阵的速度。¤All of you present, if you are proficient in the formation, please come forward to discuss together, perhaps you can speed up the speed of breaking this formation.
你决定...?¤What do you decide...?
有几人似乎抢先一步来到了这里，此时正在半空之中打转巡视.¤A few people seem to have arrived here ahead of others and are now cruising around in mid-air.
公孙兄，我来助你。¤Brother Gongsun, I'm here to help you.
原来是{FirstName}{gongzi}，不知你对于破解此阵有何见解？¤So it's {FirstName}{gongzi}, I wonder what insights you have about breaking this formation?
多谢道友相助，不知你对于破解此阵有何见解？¤Thank you for your help, I wonder what insights you have for breaking this formation?
我来助你。¤I'll help you.
这古阵法布置的固然巧妙，但毕竟大小有限，且无人操控。仅需两人神念相连，分别从不同方向进行搜索，同时拔出阵旗，便可破阵。¤This ancient formation is certainly cleverly arranged, but after all, the size is limited, and no one to control. Only two people need to be connected, respectively, from different directions to search, while pulling out the formation flag, you can break the formation.
哈哈哈，此计甚好。既然无人操控，那再精妙的阵法也会缺乏变化，只需仔细搜索出阵旗位置，便可破阵。¤Hahaha, this plan is very good. Since there is no one to control it, then even the most exquisite formations will lack changes, just search carefully for the position of the formation flags, then you can break the formation.
你与公孙季双双领悟了《奇门遁甲录》了精要，虽然还只掌握了一丝皮毛，但要凭此破除眼前的阵法却也不是难事了。¤You and Gongsun Ji both comprehended the 《Qi Men Dun Jia Record》essence, although still only mastered a small amount, but to break the formation in front of you with this is not difficult.
石雕兽像成十字型分别居于正东、正南、正西、正北及正中方，每座雕像上的灵兽似乎各有不同。¤The stone statues are in the shape of a cross in the east, south, west, north and center, and each statue seems to have a different spirit animal.
你仔细观察一番，其上的灵兽分别为青龙、朱雀、白虎、玄武以及应龙，你心下有所推断时，一只手轻轻地拍了拍你的肩膀。¤You look carefully, the spirit animals on them are Green Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, Black Tortoise and Ying Long, you inferred when a hand gently tapped you on the shoulder.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}有何见解？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}What are your insights?
不敢班门弄斧，不过依我之见，此雕塑是否与五行相关？¤I don't dare to be a class act, but in my opinion, is this sculpture related to the five elements?
不错，先前我曾见过相似的阵法，这些石雕被激活后会释放出其内封印的守护兽，虽说未必是雕刻的形象，但一定与其上兽形对应的五行属性相同，也受五行相生相克之道的影响。¤Yes, I have seen similar formations before. After these stone carvings are activated, they will release the guardian beasts sealed inside. Although they may not be the carved images, they must have the same attributes as the five elements corresponding to the beasts above, and are also affected by the mutual growth and mutual restraint of the five elements. influence of the way.
比如那只水属性的傀儡，若是用火属性的法术攻击它，恐怕难伤其分毫，但若是用土属性的法术攻击它，便可事半功倍。¤For example, if the water attribute puppet is attacked with fire attribute spells, it will hardly hurt it, but if it is attacked with earth attribute spells, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort.
此事好说，我...¤This is a good thing, I...
此事好说，我可以负责其中的...¤I can take care of the...
区区五兽，若是往常我一人便可对付。只不过刚刚在其他地方受了些轻伤，现在还没有完全恢复，不便出手。¤I can take care of the five beasts, if I could handle them alone. But I just got some minor injuries elsewhere, and I'm not fully recovered yet, so I'm not at liberty to do anything.
无妨，无妨。我再去寻其他人帮忙便是。¤No matter, no matter. I'll go find others to help.
既然如此，这尊兽像便拜托{FirstName}{xiongdi}了。¤In that case, this beast statue will be left to {FirstName}{xiongdi}.
几只守护兽而已，我一人便可解决，而且我对于炼制这些傀儡兽的材质也颇为感兴趣，公孙兄就将他们让与我，如何？¤I can handle a few guardian beasts alone, and I'm also interested in the materials used to make these puppet beasts, so how about you let me have them?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}果真胆识过人！既然如此，那这几尊兽像便拜托你了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} really has a lot of guts! If that's the case, then these beast statues are in your hands.
你与公孙季二人分工行动，连掐法决，开始尝试逐一破解剩余的连环阵法。¤You and Gongsun Ji both divide the work and action, and even pinch the spell, and begin to try to break the remaining chain of formations one by one.
这些阵法虽说无人操控，但往往刚刚破除一个，便又在另外一处生出一个更为难缠的新阵法，即便你们二人合力，也不免感到一丝无力。¤Although these formations are uncontrolled, but often just break, will be in another place to give birth to a more difficult new formation, even if the two of you together, can not help but feel a touch of powerlessness.
真是了不得...难道...难道这便是传说中的奇门遁甲之术？¤It's amazing... Is it... Could this be the legendary art of the strange doors?
难怪如此棘手...那依公孙兄所见，该如何才能破除这些连环阵法？¤No wonder it's so tricky... Then, according to Brother Gongsun, how can we break these chain formations?
不错，相传以此手法布阵时，可源源不断地从天地间吸收灵气。因此，布阵者往往可以在一瞬之间便布下多重连环阵法，令破阵之人无从下手。¤Yes, it is said that when this technique is used to set up a formation, it can continuously absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth. Therefore, the person who sets up the formation can often set up multiple consecutive formations in a flash, so that the person who breaks the formation has no way to start.
哈哈哈，此等{color=#d0380a}大好机缘{/color}正在眼前，{$TmpTalkString}竟还在想着如何破阵么？¤Hahahaha, these {color=#d0380a}great opportunities{/color} are right in front of you, {$TmpTalkString} and you are still thinking about how to break the formation?
只见公孙季一遍说着，一边盘腿坐下，连掐法决祭出五柄阵旗，然后操控着阵旗围绕着他缓慢旋转起来。¤I saw Gongsun Ji once said, while sitting cross-legged, and even pinch the spell to sacrifice five formation flags, and then manipulate the formation flags around him slowly rotate up.
公孙季一言不发，只是盘腿坐下，连掐法决祭出五柄阵旗，然后操控着阵旗围绕着他缓慢旋转起来。¤Gongsun Ji did not say a word, just sit down cross-legged, and even pinch the spell to sacrifice five formation flags, and then manipulate the formation flags around him slowly rotate up.
公孙季一言不发，你一时不解他是何意，只当他是想出了什么你没能想到的破阵方式，只能退至一旁等候。¤Gongsun Ji did not say a word, you do not understand for a moment what he meant, only that he came up with something you could not think of the way to break the formation, can only retreat to the side to wait.
你楞了一下，随机也心领神会的盘腿坐下。若能借此机会领悟《奇门遁甲录》，倒是再想破除这里的阵法自然是手到擒来。¤You are stumped for a moment, randomly also understand the mind cross-legged sitting. If you can take this opportunity to comprehend the 《Qi Men Dun Jia Record》, but then want to break the formation here is naturally handy.
领悟{color=#d0380a}《奇门遁甲录》{/color}¤Comprehending {color=#d0380a}《Strange Gate Disappearing Armor Manual 》{/color}
随着阵法被破，浓雾褪去，五只石雕兽像缓缓地由地下升起，破开土石的遮掩，显露在人们面前。¤With the formation was broken, the fog faded, five stone beast statues slowly rose from the ground, breaking through the cover of earth and stone, revealed in front of people.
前方便是异象显现之地，你察觉到不少修士都正在往这个方向靠拢。前路难测，你决定...？¤Ahead of you is the place where the vision is manifesting, and you perceive that many cultivators are approaching this direction. The road ahead is unpredictable, you decide...?
要进入下一层么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Want to go to the next level? {w}{w=0.5}
沿着石阶走了大约一炷香的时间，你们遥遥望见通往下一层的石台。几位修士见此略微加快了脚步，你敏锐地察觉到似乎有什么正从头顶飞掠而来。¤After walking along the stone steps for about an incense burner, you can see the stone platform leading to the next level from a distance. A few cultivators see this and speed up their steps slightly, and you are keenly aware of what seems to be flying overhead.
几枚金灿灿的箭支从一旁飞出，似是能够追寻踪迹般迅敏地朝着那几位走在前方的修士的头颅射去。¤Several golden arrows flew out from the side, seemingly able to follow the trail as swiftly and sensitively shot towards the heads of those several cultivators walking in front.
走在最前面的倪旭欣险些被击中，所幸他似乎随身携带着什么高阶的防御法宝，这才帮他抵挡下来。¤Ni XuXin, who was at the front, was almost hit, but fortunately he seemed to be carrying some kind of high-grade defensive magic treasure with him, which helped him to fend off.
只是另外的几位修士躲闪不急，被那小箭射个正着，半息时间便昏死过去。而余下众人各显神通，开始对付那几支诡异的光箭。¤Just a few other cultivators dodged in a hurry, was shot by that small arrow right in the head, half a breath to faint. And the rest of the people showed their own magic, began to deal with those strange light arrows.
此言一出，几道神识攻击破空而出，果真将那箭击碎成点点光屑。¤The words, a few soul sense attack out of the air, really will be the arrow broken into points of light crumbs.
小心，这是神识陷阱！¤Be careful, this is a soul sense trap!
呼...呼...呼...好险...¤Hoo... Hoo... Hoo... Hoo... Hoo... That was close...
倪旭欣脚下拌蒜，一屁股跌坐在地上，大口大口地喘着粗气。¤Ni XuXin tossed his feet and fell on his buttocks, gasping for air.
林姑娘，你识得这箭矢的由来？¤Miss Lin, do you know the origin of this arrow?
不错，我曾在族中记录的秘术中读到过一种能够直接攻击修士神识的机关陷阱，唤作夺魄箭。¤Yes, I have read in the secret arts recorded in the clan about a trap that can directly attack the cultivator's consciousness, called the Soul Snatching Arrow.
这种箭矢没有实体，无法用寻常的灵气护罩进行抵挡。要想通过这里，就只有凝聚神识，形成一道足够防御其攻击的屏障才行。¤This kind of arrow has no solid body, and cannot be resisted by ordinary aura shield. The only way to get through here is to gather the soul sense and form a barrier sufficient to defend against its attack.
我不擅长神识防御，不过我看这箭矢的飞行速度并不快，足够让我以身法躲开。只要冲过这一段台阶，应该就不会再受到攻击了。¤I am not good at soul sense defense, but I see that the flight speed of this arrow is not fast enough for me to dodge with my body technique. As long as you rush through this section of the steps, you should not be attacked again.
百里奇说完，便闪身向前冲去。夺魂剑再次飞出，百里奇脚下步伐变换，化出道道残影，将飞来的箭矢一一避开。¤When Bailiqi finished, he dashed forward. The soul-stealing sword flew out again, and Bailiqi's feet changed pace, creating a streak of shadow, avoiding the flying arrows one by one.
短短一息之间，他便成功跃过台阶，抵达了安全的地段。¤In just a short time, he managed to leap over the steps and reached the safety of the lot.
见百里奇成功穿过，众人各展其长，或以神识屏障相抵，或依仗法宝或是丹药硬闯，纷纷通过此地。¤Seeing Baili Qi successfully crossed, the crowd showed their strengths, or with soul sense barrier to resist, or rely on magic treasures or pills to break through, have passed this place.
既已摸清陷阱的底细，你决定...¤Since the trap has been clearly understood, you decided to...
经过陷阱时，那箭果然又向你飞来。你早有应对之法，以神识屏障轻松化解了攻击。¤When you passed the trap, the arrow really came at you again. You had a way to deal with it and easily defused the attack with your soul sense barrier.
你身法精妙，效仿百里奇的方式顺利的闯过了这处陷阱。¤Your body technique is exquisite, and you follow the example of Bailiqi and smoothly break through the trap.
要向谁求助呢...¤Who to ask for help...
我不擅于神识防御，凭身法硬闯风险未免又太大，仅靠自己一人似乎难以安全通过。¤I'm not good at soul sense defense, and the risk of breaking through with my body technique is too great, and it seems difficult to pass safely by myself alone.
你看了一眼还坐在地上的倪道友，不禁有些头大...¤You glance at Daoist Ni, who is still sitting on the ground, and can't help but feel a bit frustrated...
好险好险，没想到这里还有人设下了陷阱，当真阴险。¤So close, so close, I did not expect that there are people here set traps, really sinister.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}不用担心，此番我身上带了不少的丹药，以备不时之需。这几枚是可以临战增幅神识的丹药，咱们服下后便可通过这里。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}Don't worry, this time I brought a lot of pills with me, just in case. These are the pills that can increase the soul sense in the face of battle, we can pass through here after taking them.
你在倪旭欣几颗丹药的帮助下狼狈地越过了这处陷阱...¤You woefully crossed this trap with the help of a few pills from Ni XuXin...
你看向还站一旁的林沐心，她心领神会地对你笑了笑。¤You look to Lin MuXin, who is still standing aside, and she smiles at you knowingly.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}不用担心，我们林家的独门秘术中有记载过几种对付这种陷阱的办法。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}Don't worry, there are several ways to deal with this kind of trap recorded in our Lin family's unique secret art.
你跟着我一起，我自有办法护你周全。¤You follow me along, I have my own way to protect you.
你在林沐心的帮助下顺利地越过了这处陷阱...¤You crossed the trap with the help of Lin MuXin...
{FirstName}{xiongdi}莫慌，我有一件神识类的防御法宝，可助你我二人通过此地。¤I have a soul sense defense treasure that can help you and me get through this place.
你在公孙季的帮助下顺利地越过了这处陷阱...¤You crossed the trap with the help of Gongsun Ji...
要阅读石壁上的文字么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Want to read the writing on the stone wall? {w}{w=0.5}
魔物！这剑是魔物！它在蚕食我的神魄...我的识海正在被魔气污染！我想把剑丢下逃到外面...外面的人也疯了！没有意识、不知疼痛...古原城的煞气竟如此恐怖！¤A demonic object! This sword is a demonic creature! It's eating away at my spirit... My sea of consciousness is being contaminated by demonic energy! I want to drop the sword and escape outside... The people outside have gone crazy too! Unconscious, unaware of pain... The foul aura of Gu Yuan City is so horrible!
我又回到了这里...还好我带来的灵药够多，我要在此研究出克制魔煞之气的丹药才行......留给我的时间不多了，再这样下去我迟早会变成外面的疯子！！！¤I'm back here again... Luckily, I brought enough Pills with me, I need to research here to find a potion to restrain the demonic fury ...... I don't have much time left, if this goes on I'll turn into a madman out there sooner or later!
你们行至一间简陋的石室，靠近出口的那侧墙壁上似乎刻上了万年前的古文。壁上的文字笔力雄健，飞动舒展，即使历经万年岁月仍有淡淡的灵力蕴于其中。¤You walk to a humble stone room, the wall on the side near the exit seems to be carved with ancient texts from ten thousand years ago. The writing on the wall is majestic, flying and spreading, and even after 10,000 years there is still a faint spiritual power contained in it.
我得到了！这剑终究落入我手中了！得此宝剑，我玄机散人的名号必定响彻宁州，离飞升也不过一步之遥！¤I got it! This sword has finally fallen into my hands! With this sword, my name will definitely resound in Ning Province, and I will be just one step away from ascension!
外面的修士还在寻找剑的下落，我要先躲在这里避避风头。有我引以为傲的阵法遮掩，他们必定不会找到我的藏身之处！古原城即将塌陷算得了什么，最多五百年...最多五百年我便可踏破虚空，直济琼瑶，哈哈！¤The cultivators outside are still looking for the whereabouts of the sword. I have to hide here first to avoid the limelight. With the formation that I am proud of, they will definitely not find my hiding place! Guyuan City is about to collapse, what is it, at most five hundred years... At most five hundred years, I can step through the void and directly help Qiongyao, haha!
又有一只煞魔向众人扑来!¤Another Fury Demon pounces on the crowd!
你决定...¤You decide...
你默默退至众人身后，此番大家有了经验，纷纷祭出法宝攻击，很快便将那只煞魔击溃。¤You silently retreat behind the crowd, and this time everyone has experience, have sacrificed magic treasures to attack, and quickly defeated the demon.
（此山地处竹山宗与逸风城交界，又历来人迹罕至，实是藏身的好地方。）¤(This mountain is located at the junction of Zhushan Sect and Yifeng City, and it has always been inaccessible. It is a good place to hide.)
哎，刚刚才得罪那位前辈，我还是不要再回去了。¤Hey, I just offended that senior, I'd better not go back.
附近似乎被布下了重重禁制，无法进入其中。¤The vicinity seems to be heavily forbidden, and it is impossible to enter it.
你拿出信物，只见禁制外围开始变幻，很快便留出了一个可供一人通行的通道。¤You take out the token, only to see the periphery of the prohibition began to change, and soon left a passage for one person to pass.
要离开白帝楼底层吗？¤Do you want to leave the bottom floor of the White Emperor Manor?
这里是底层剑池，要在此地采集材料吗？¤This is the bottom sword pool, want to collect materials here?
要回到上一层么？{w}{w=0.5}¤To go back to the upper level? {w}{w=0.5}
前方的煞气似乎又浓郁了几分，昏暗的石径深处传来一股令人不适的威压感。¤The fierce aura ahead seems to have thickened a few more points, and an uncomfortable sense of intimidation comes from the depths of the dimly lit stone path.
察觉到这一点的你们重新整顿队伍，放缓速度小心地向前方行进。¤Noticing this, you reorganized your group and slowed down your speed to move ahead carefully.
一道细小的黑影在不远处的石阶前席地而坐，你所感受到的威压正是从那里传来。¤A small dark shadow is sitting on the ground in front of the stone steps not far away, and the pressure you feel is coming from there.
小心，这股威压非同寻常。¤Be careful, this pressure is unusual.
那人阻拦在你们前往深处的必经之路上，若想前往深处必定与他有所交集。¤That person is blocking your way to the depths, if you want to go to the depths you must cross paths with him.
黑影低着头，一头长发杂乱地垂下，将面目遮住。血红色的煞气围绕在他的身边，凝结成恍若实体的遮罩。¤The black shadow lowered his head, his long hair hanging down in a messy manner, hiding his face. The blood-red aura surrounds him, condensing into a solid Shield.
这人看起来当真是十分棘手。¤This person really looks very tricky.
从气息上看应当有元婴大圆满的修为...但这压迫感......¤From the aura should have the cultivation of YuanYing DaChuan... But this oppressive feeling ......
此般实力...难不成...他就是搭建这座地宫的玄机真人？¤This kind of strength... It is difficult not to ... He is the real Xuanji who built this underground palace?
生...死...¤Life... Death...
他嘴里含糊不清地轻声念叨着你们听不懂的话语。¤His mouth whispered in a slurred voice, words you can't understand.
没想到连这等人物竟也被煞气侵蚀得失了神智。¤I didn't expect that even such a person would lose his mind due to the fury.
小心，他似乎在附近还布下了其它阵法...奇怪...¤Be careful, he seems to have placed other formations nearby... Strange...
那玄机散人仿佛察觉到你们的到来，抬起头来看向你们。猩红色的眸子里闪动着诡异的光，只与他对视了一眼，你便感到一阵头晕目眩，恶心作呕。¤As if sensing your arrival, that Xuan Ji San Ren raised his head to look at you. The scarlet eyes shone with an eerie light, and after just one glance with him, you felt dizzy and sick to your stomach.
你暗道一声不妙，运起一股灵气直冲天灵，瞬间便清醒过来。¤You cry out in disbelief and run up a surge of spiritual energy straight to your heavenly spirit, coming to your senses in an instant.
再向周围望去时，只见那些修为稍低的修士都已神志不清地跌倒在地，一时半会儿看来是恢复不了。¤When you look around, you see that the cultivators with a lower cultivation level have fallen to the ground in confusion, and it seems that they will not recover for a while.
你们替我压阵，我先先来会会他！¤You guys hold the line for me, I'll meet him first!
不能轻敌，此人修为实乃当世罕见，又有血煞之气扰魂，我没有把握能对付他。¤This person's cultivation is really rare in the world, and there is the blood-dead Qi disturbing the soul, I am not sure I can deal with him.
你连忙盘腿坐下，将周身灵气足足运转了三个大周天后，才缓过劲来。¤You hastily sit down cross-legged, the body's aura will run three big days, only after the strength.
我已有对敌之策，大家先按我所指的方位结成合阵，若任何一人受到攻击，其他人皆可支援。¤I already have a plan to deal with the enemy, we first form a joint formation in the direction I pointed out, if any one person is attacked, the others can support.
不过一人而已，何必如此瞻前顾后。我先试试他的手段！¤It's only one person, so why be so forward and backward. I'll try his tactics first!
百里奇一个纵身便冲了上去，还未等他靠近，玄机真人布下的阵法便自行运转起来，将众人围困在内。¤Before he could get close, the formation laid by the real Xuanji was working on its own, trapping the crowd.
我也来助你，怪人吃我一剑！¤I will also help you, the strange man eat my sword!
罢了，既然如此就由百里兄负责主攻，倪兄和林姑娘在一旁协助。我们剩下的人先想办法破除周围的阵法。¤That's all, in that case, Brother Baili will be responsible for the main attack, Brother Ni and Miss Lin will assist from the side. The rest of us will first try to break the surrounding formation.
众人在公孙季的指引之下将外围的阵法一一破除，尽管那玄机真人也算修为通天，但在场的诸位皆是如今宁州数一数二的高手，联手之下也不惧于他。¤The crowd was guided by Gongsun Ji to break the outer formations one by one. Although that Xuanji Lord is also considered to be of great cultivation, but all of us present are now one of the best experts in Ning Province, and together we are not afraid of him.
百里奇一拳击散了玄机真人的元婴，伴随着玄机真人的身死，威压渐渐散去，但地宫深处传来的煞气却愈发浓烈起来。¤Baili Qi scattered Lord Xuanji's Nascent Soul with a single punch. With the death of Lord Xuanji, the pressure gradually dissipated, but the fierce aura from the depths of the underground palace has become more and more intense.
果然是这样...¤it is as expected...
公孙兄指的是？¤What did Brother Gongsun mean?
刚刚我便有些疑虑，布下这些阵法的人与其说是为了防止外人闯入，反倒是更害怕里面有什么东西出来。¤I was a little bit suspicious just now. The people who set up these formations are not so much to prevent outsiders from breaking in, but are more afraid of something coming out of it.
那几个敛息的阵法也证明了这一点。你们看，一旦阵法破除，地宫深处传来的煞气便更甚以往。¤The formations that conquer the breath also prove this. You see, once the formations are broken, the evil spirit from the depths of the underground palace will be even stronger than before.
看来，那玄机真人布下这重重机关与阵法，是为了将某样至凶至邪之物封印起来...会是什么呢？¤It seems that the mystery Lord deployed these numerous organs and formations in order to seal up something that is extremely evil and evil... what would it be?
亲自看看不就知道了。能见识一下这种级别的法宝出世的景象，这次也算不虚此行了。¤If you look at it yourself, you won't know. It's a worthwhile trip to see the birth of a magic weapon of this level.
你眼前一黑，跌坐在地。¤You fall to the ground with a black eye.
快运气调息，将煞气逼出体外。¤Quick luck to adjust the breath, will be forced out of the body.
再向周围望去时，只见那些修为稍低的修士都已神志不清地跌倒在地，看来他们也和你一样，一时半会儿是恢复不了。¤When you look around again, you see that those cultivators with lower cultivation levels have fallen to the ground in confusion, and it seems that they, like you, cannot recover for a while.
嗡——¤Buzz--
一阵尖锐刺耳的剑鸣声突然响起，一柄通体被煞气沾染的魔剑不知从何处飞来，众人连忙闪身躲避。¤A sharp and ear-piercing sword sound suddenly rang out, a body tainted by the magic sword from nowhere to fly, the crowd dodged.
哦？难道这就是多宝塔里封印的那把剑吗？看这股气息，果然不是凡品。¤Oh? Is this the sword that is sealed in the Tower of Many Treasures? Look at the aura, it is really not ordinary goods.
好剑，好剑。此剑至少也有纯阳法宝级别，看我将它拿下！¤Good sword, good sword. This sword is at least pure Yang magic treasure level, let me take it down!
倪旭欣御起灵剑，就向魔剑攻去，一时间剑气四溢，两柄剑竟打了个势均力敌，好不热闹。¤Ni XuXin, the spirit sword, attacked the demon sword, the Sword Qi overflowed, and the two swords fought evenly.
这柄剑...¤This sword ...
我也有这种感觉，老头儿。你可是想说这里的剑灵和御剑门里的剑灵有些许相似之处？¤I feel the same way, old man. But you want to say that the sword spirit here and the sword spirit in the Imperial Sword Sect have some similarities?
不错，御剑门之内的杀戮也与此剑类似，沾染着不知从何而来的魔气。这柄剑虽煞气四溢，掩盖住了那古怪的气息，但通过他们的交手，我很确定它也有被魔气侵蚀的迹象。¤Yes, the killing within the Imperial Sword Sect is also similar to this sword, tainted with a demonic aura that comes from nowhere. Although this sword is overflowing with fury, covering up that odd aura, I'm pretty sure through their exchange that it also shows signs of being tainted with demonic energy.
真是奇怪...难道这就是刚才玄机上人提到的“那把剑”？¤How strange... Could this be the sword mentioned by Lord Xuanji?
依我之见，那玄机上人最初的记录中，字里行间满是对那剑的夸耀之情，这把魔剑品质虽然尚可，但也不至于令元婴圆满的修士另眼相看，其中定有其他玄机才是。¤From my point of view, the original record of the superior Xuanji, between the lines is full of praise for the sword, the quality of this magic sword is not bad, but not so much as to make the YuanYing perfect cultivator look at, there must be other mysteries.
那倪旭欣与魔剑斗得兴起，一时间僵持不下，反倒是在后面围观的众人渐渐不耐烦起来。¤That Ni XuXin and the magic sword fought with excitement, a time stalemate, but in the back of the crowd of spectators gradually impatient up.
够了，我们这么多人来这里是为了调查此地异象的，可没有功夫看你一个人耍剑。¤Enough, so many of us are here to investigate the vision of this place, but there is no time to watch you play swords alone.
我们一起出手，尽快把这柄魔剑拿下。¤Let’s take action together and take down this magic sword as soon as possible.
化尘教的众人纷纷祭出法宝围攻上去，很快便将魔剑压制下来。¤The people of the Aeonic Sands Temple one after another released magic weapons to besiege them, and soon suppressed the magic sword.
可惜可惜，我还没有施展我的独门剑招，否则定能将此魔剑拿下！¤Unfortunately, I have not yet performed my unique sword moves, otherwise I will be able to take down this magic sword!
魏老头，你怎么看？¤Old man Wei, what do you think?
此剑若论品阶，应当和我们在御剑门中所遇到的剑灵相差无几，但实力却能与元婴期修士媲美。¤The rank of this sword should be the same as the sword spirit we encountered in the Imperial Sword Sect, but its strength is comparable to that of the Nascent Soul-period cultivators.
如果我所料不错，这地宫中应该封印着什么了不得的魔物。若是法宝的话，恐怕是通天灵宝这一级别的。¤If I expected it to be true, there should be some incredible monsters sealed in this underground palace. If it is a magic weapon, it might be of the level of Tongtian Lingbao.
若非如此，又怎么会吸引这么多人过来，说不定待会儿还会有一番恶战。¤If it weren't for this, how could it attract so many people over, maybe there will be a fierce battle later.
依旧是类似的石室，不过那些纷杂凌乱的符号已经很难以“文字”来称呼，只能算是一大段看不清形状的划痕。¤The same stone room is still similar, but the messy symbols are difficult to call words, only a large section of unreadable scratches.
方正古朴的大殿内一尘不染，与宁州古迹内的其它断壁残垣截然不同，只有在这里你还能感受到古原城旧日的辉煌景象。¤The Fangzheng quaint hall is spotless, completely different from other ruins in the ancient ruins of Ning Province. Only here you can feel the glorious scene of the ancient city.
若想开启试炼，只需将灵气注入石碑。切记，凡入登仙阁者，皆只有一次机会接受试炼。¤If you want to start the trial, you only need to pour aura into the stele. Remember, anyone who enters the fairy pavilion has only one chance to receive the trial.
一块方尖碑伫立在大殿的正中，石碑的表面散发着柔和的光芒。而除了这块石碑外，四周空荡荡的，什么也没有。¤An obelisk stands in the middle of the main hall, and the surface of the stele exudes a soft light. Except for this stele, there is nothing all around it.
你将手掌贴在石碑之上，一道耀眼的强光旋即将你淹没...当光芒消散后，你也凭空消失了。¤You put your palm on the stone tablet, and a dazzling light will soon overwhelm you... When the light dissipated, you also disappeared out of thin air.
你攻击你能看到的墙壁试试。¤You try attacking the walls you can see.
一阵天旋地转过后，你回到了入口处。¤After a while, you are back to the entrance.
这到底是哪里，根本看不到尽头！¤Where is this? There is no end in sight!
不要在合阵中和他们硬碰硬，先冲出去再说。一次面对这么多人的攻击对你很不利！¤Don't go head-to-head with them in the lineup, rush out first before talking. It's not good for you to face so many attacks at once!
没错，你将五感切断，神识内敛，摒除一切杂念，如此便可魂归肉身。¤Yes, you cut off your five senses, your mind is restrained, and get rid of all distracting thoughts, so that your soul will return to your body.
结阵！¤End!
如此大型的石廊，若是在古原城内，我一定已经见过...难道是在地下？¤Such a large stone corridor, if it were in the ancient city, I must have seen it... Could it be underground?
你凝聚周身灵气，连斩三人，终于打出一个突破口，从合阵中冲了出去，向石廊深处跑去。刚刚被你打倒的石人果然又恢复原状，跟在你的身后追了过来。¤You condensed the aura of your whole body, slashed the three of you, and finally made a breakthrough, rushed out of the formation, and ran to the depths of the stone corridor. The stone man who was just downed by you really returned to its original state and chased after you. Come here.
真是闻所未闻...那岂不是说，我只要能将魂魄收回肉身，就能离开这里了？¤It's unheard of... Doesn't that mean that if I can take my soul back to my body, I can leave here?
你将灵力凝聚于掌心，猛地向石壁挥去，石壁却纹丝不动，整块墙面宛如一体铸造，你的全力一掌竟无法留下一丝伤痕。¤You condensed your spiritual power in the palm of your hand and slammed it towards the stone wall, but the stone wall did not move at all. The whole wall seemed to be cast in one piece, and your full palm could not leave a trace of scar.
还未等你好好观察周围的环境，只听身后传来一阵噼里啪啦的响声，石壁中竟钻出数十个石人。他们一脱离墙面，五官面容与衣着就迅速变化起来，看上去与常人无异。¤I haven't waited for you to observe the surrounding environment. I only heard a crackling sound behind you. Dozens of stone men were drilled out of the rock wall. As soon as they left the wall, their facial features and clothes changed rapidly, and they looked similar to each other. Ordinary people are no different.
那十余人将你团团围住，紧跟着便直接杀了过来。¤The dozen or so people surrounded you, and immediately killed them.
石廊...？¤Stone Corridor...?
在这个空间内，你和我，包括那些石人都只是灵魂体罢了，大家都没有肉身的保护，只是以魂魄的力量在互相攻击。¤In this space, you and me, including the stone people, are just soul bodies. No one is protected by the body, but they are attacking each other with the power of the soul.
你看准时机，将其中一人拦腰斩成数段，但他破碎的身体很快化为一滩银灰色的液体，又重新凝聚起来。周围的其他人又向你攻来，你只能闪身躲开。¤You see your chance and cut one of them into several pieces, but his shattered body soon turns into a puddle of silvery-grey liquid and regroups. The others around you come at you again, and you can only dodge out of the way.
如果我没猜错的话，这里是一处独立的结界空间，我们看到的是石廊和石人都只不过是掩人耳目的表象罢了。¤If I'm not mistaken, this is an independent enchantment space. What we see is that the stone corridor and the stone people are just concealing appearances.
见此情景，你长舒一口气，盘腿坐下，开始尝试切断五感，摒弃杂念...¤Seeing this, you take a long sigh of relief, sit down cross-legged, and start trying to cut off your five senses and discard distracting thoughts...
你如今也已经有了不俗的修为，但要论对魂魄力量的掌控，可是远远不如老夫。¤You already have a good cultivation base now, but in terms of controlling the power of the soul, you are far inferior to the old man.
或许是这样...¤Maybe so...
魏无极大喝一声，竟凭空凝聚出一道剑刃，将身后一人的脑袋刺出一个大窟窿来。¤Wei Wuji yelled, unexpectedly condensing a blade out of thin air, piercing a big hole in the head of the person behind him.
怎么可能，这些人分明都是不死之身。这样打下去就算打到我灵力枯竭，也拿他们没有任何办法。¤How is it possible, these people are clearly immortal. Even if my spiritual strength is exhausted, there is nothing to do with them.
放心吧，这一千多年我也不是毫无长进，这些人我来帮你对付，你专心寻找肉身方位便是。¤Don't worry, I haven't made no progress over the past thousand years. I will help you deal with these people. You can concentrate on finding the physical location.
这幻象也未免太真实了，那些石人围困我的那些攻击可都是实实在在的，我可挨不了几下。¤This illusion is too real. The attacks of those stone men besieging me are real, and I can't stand it a few times.
一阵天旋地转后，你发现自身已经处在一高大的石廊之中。这廊道不到十丈宽，却足有数百丈之高，向前看更是一眼望不到头。看这规模，应该已经远远超过你在外围所见到的那座登仙殿。¤After a while, you find that you are already in a tall stone corridor. This corridor is less than ten feet wide, but it is hundreds of feet high. Looking forward, you can't even see your head. Looking at this scale, it should be. It's far surpassed the Dengxian Hall you saw on the periphery.
去！¤go with!
不好，这下试炼大概是失败了！¤No, this trial probably failed!
哈哈哈，我果然所料不错。这登仙殿的阁主好手段，竟能将人的肉体与魂魄分别传送到两个不同的空间。¤Hahaha, I really expected it to be good. This pavilion master of the Immortal Palace can teleport the human body and soul to two different spaces.
你...你怎么能打到他们？¤You... how can you hit them?
只见魏无极召唤出数十柄灵气飞剑，围绕你们二人形成一个飞速旋转的剑阵，轻松便将那些石人挡在外面。¤I saw Wei Wuji summon dozens of flying swords of spiritual energy, forming a rapidly rotating sword formation around the two of you, easily blocking the stone men outside.
说的简单，我光是要躲避那些石人的攻击就极为不易，哪里还有功夫做这些。¤Simply speaking, it is extremely difficult for me to avoid the attacks of those stone men. There is no time to do this.
这千年来我对灵魂能力的运用颇有研究，或许我可以将自己的一部分力量强行分给{ta}，这样或许便能够满足领悟《玄清天衍录》的条件。¤I have studied the use of my soul power over the past thousand years, so perhaps I can forcibly divide some of my own power into {ta}, which might be able to satisfy the conditions for comprehending the《 Xuanqing Heavenly Derivation》 Record.
你按虚影的要求盘腿坐下，很快，一道神念传入你的识海。你下意识地控制神识与这道神念接触，却丝毫没有任何反应。¤You sit down cross-legged as requested by the phantom, and soon, a divine consciousness spreads into your sea of ​​consciousness. You subconsciously control the divine consciousness to contact this divine consciousness, but there is no response at all.
上万年？你怎么可能活这么久？¤Ten thousand years? How could you live so long?
很快，刚才那道神念再一次传入你的识海。你控制神识与它刚一接触，便有无数的文字钻入你的脑海之中。¤Soon, the divine consciousness just now spreads into your sea of ​​consciousness again. As soon as you control the divine consciousness and come into contact with it, countless words dig into your mind.
玄微飞升后，此人便破解了外围的传送阵法，未曾经过试炼就直接进入了内殿。¤After Xuanwei ascended, this person cracked the outer teleportation array and entered the inner hall directly before the trial.
你不一样！你可是...¤You are different! You are...
灵魂体？你是怎么进入这里的？¤Soul body? How did you get here?
难道是你帮了他？怎么可能，登仙殿的阵法不可能将两个灵魂同时传送到一个空间，除非...¤Did you help him? How could it be possible that the formation of Dengxiandian could not transmit two souls to the same space at the same time, unless...
来吧，我们再试一次。¤Come on, let's try again.
只需观摩这些笔走游龙的字体，你便感到体内的灵气似受到呼应般地开始沸腾，正在按照功法所记录的那样自行地运转起来。¤Just by observing the fonts of these pens and walking dragons, you will feel that the aura in your body starts to boil as if it is being echoed, and it is running on its own as recorded in the exercises.
想要修炼这《玄清天衍录》，必须有极强的灵魂能量作为基础。尽管那人修为不俗，但这最基础的条件却无法满足。¤If you want to cultivate this Xuan Qing Tian Yan Lu, you must have a strong soul energy as a foundation. Although the person has a good cultivation level, the most basic conditions cannot be met.
看来若想要通过试炼，必须依靠自身的灵魂力量击败那些石人，这也是那玄微设下这种试炼关卡的原因吧。¤It seems that if you want to pass the trial, you must rely on your own soul power to defeat the stone men. This is why the Xuanwei set up this trial level.
这里是登仙殿真正的内阁，唯有通过玄微老贼设下的诸多考验之人，才能来到这里。¤This is the real cabinet of Dengxian Hall. Only those who have passed the many tests set by the old thief Xuanwei can come here.
呼...¤call...
名字这种东西，几千年前我便忘了。我或许曾经是人，是妖，也可能是魔，又有什么关系...现在我仅剩下这一缕残念，被永远拘束于此。¤I forgot something like a name thousands of years ago. I may have been a human, a demon, or a demon, what does it matter... Now I only have this remnant thought, and I am bound forever. this.
你口中的玄微，便是建立这座登仙殿之人么？¤The Xuanwei in your mouth is the one who built this Immortal Hall?
也差不多是时候替你接受传承了，你且坐好。¤It's almost time to accept the inheritance for you, you sit still.
这么说，若是我得到了这份传承，你便可以解脱了？¤That said, if I get this inheritance, you will be free?
无妨，灵魂能量稍有损耗罢了...没有伤及根源，很快就可以恢复的。¤It's okay, the soul energy is a little bit depleted... It doesn't hurt the root cause, it will be restored soon.
一阵笑声将你唤醒，你睁开眼，正好看到那道虚影化为点点星光，消散在空气之中。¤A burst of laughter wakes you up, you open your eyes, just in time to see the phantom turning into a little starlight, dissipating in the air.
太久没有和人说过话了，我已经被这无尽的孤独折磨了上万年...¤It's been a long time since I spoke to anyone. I have been tortured by this endless loneliness for tens of thousands of years...
{w}{w=0.5}我知道你一定有很多想问的...尽管问吧，我会一一给你解答。¤{w}{w=0.5} I know you must have a lot to ask... Just ask, I will answer you one by one.
你依魏无极所言，重新入定，魏无极的声音在你脑海中轻轻响起。¤According to Wei Wuji's words, you re-enter Ding, Wei Wuji's voice rang gently in your mind.
玄微老贼施法将我的魂魄囚禁于此，替他守护这该死的功法传承。直到有人能够成功领悟，我才能挣脱这无尽的枷锁！¤Old thief Xuanwei used a spell to imprison my soul here, guarding this damn practice inheritance for him. Until someone can successfully comprehend it, I will be able to break free from this endless shackles!
我现在要将一部分灵魂能量分于你，注意了。¤I want to share part of the soul energy with you now, pay attention.
除非它发现不了。据我所知，除非我自行从这柄剑中脱离出来，还未曾有人能够发现我的存在。¤Unless it can't find it. As far as I know, unless I get out of this sword by myself, no one has ever discovered my existence.
不必灰心，我还有一法，或许可以一试。¤Don't be discouraged, I have another way, maybe I can try it.
没错，自登仙殿建立以来，你是第二个来到这里的人。¤Yes, you are the second person to come here since the establishment of the Dengxian Temple.
既然你能够通过玄微老贼的试炼，自然有能力领悟这门功法，今天应该就是我留在这世上的最后一日了，哈哈哈哈哈。¤Since you can pass the trial of the old thief Xuanwei, you are naturally able to comprehend this technique. Today should be the last day I stay in this world, hahahahaha.
哈哈哈哈哈，活着？如果这也算活着的话。¤Hahahahaha, alive? If this is also alive.
切断五感后，你没有了时间流逝的概念，也不知过了多久，当你再一次睁开眼的时候，发现自己已经来到了一个陌生的房间之中。¤After cutting off the five senses, you no longer have the concept of time passing, and you don't know how long it has passed. When you open your eyes again, you find that you have come to a strange room.
不会吧，难道我领悟了功法以后，这登仙殿的试炼就关闭了？¤No, after I understand the technique, the trial of climbing the Immortal Palace is closed?
这柄剑...的确，深不可测。¤This sword... indeed, unfathomable.
他与你不同，他是那玄微老贼的师弟，精通阵法，又对这登仙殿的构造了如指掌。¤He is different from you. He is the junior thief of Xuanwei old thief. He is proficient in the formation and knows the structure of the Immortal Palace.
这便是...《玄清天衍录》，不亏是万年前...所有人都想得到的顶尖功法...¤This is... Xuan Qing Tian Yan Lu, not to lose is ten thousand years ago... the top technique that everyone wanted to get...
魏老，你没事吧？¤Old Wei, are you okay?
哈哈哈，等出了古迹以后，这个消息肯定很快就会传出去。¤Hahaha, after the monuments are out, this news will definitely spread soon.
哈哈哈哈，终于成功了。¤Hahahaha, finally succeeded.
你放开识海，一团蓝色的能量体钻了进来，与你的神识慢慢融为一体。你感觉自己的灵魂不断壮大，进入了一种前所未有的清醒状态。¤You let go of the sea of ​​consciousness, and a group of blue energy bodies penetrated in and slowly merged with your divine consciousness. You feel that your soul is constantly growing and you have entered an unprecedented state of sobriety.
你扭头一看，果然不知何时，身后的门已经打开，大门之外正是你刚刚进入的主殿，还有一人正站在那块方尖碑前上下打量，所幸还没有注意到你。¤You turn your head and look. As expected, the door behind you has opened. Outside the door is the main hall you just entered. There is another person standing in front of the obelisk and looking up and down. Fortunately, he has not noticed you. .
终于又有人来了...你是这一万多年来，第一个走到这里的人类。¤Finally someone has come again... You are the first human being here in over ten thousand years.
哼，没错，便是这老贼。就算忘记了我自己的名字，我也不会忘记他！¤Hmph, that's right, it's the old thief. Even if I forget my own name, I won't forget him!
快走吧，怀璧其罪，最好还是不要让别人发现是你得到了这份传承。¤Let’s go, you’re guilty of the crime, and it’s better not to let others discover that you got this inheritance.
虚影愤怒的咆哮声将你从入定的状态唤醒，你从它的声音中感受到了巨大的愤怒与恐惧。¤The phantom's angry roar awakens you from the state of concentration, and you feel great anger and fear from its voice.
习得功法：《玄清天衍录》¤Acquisition of exercises: Xuan Qing Tian Yan Lu
不...不，这不可能！¤No...no, it's impossible!
你不是说在我之前还有其他人也来过么？他是不是也没能接受这功法的传承？¤Didn't you say that anyone else came before me? Did he fail to accept the inheritance of this technique?
没错，到时候封印解除，我自然也不会被拘束于此。¤Yes, when the seal is lifted, I will naturally not be constrained here.
为什么会这样？既然你能够通过玄微老贼的试炼，怎么可能接受不了这功法的传承！¤Why is this? Since you can pass the trial of the old thief Xuanwei, how can you not accept the inheritance of this technique!
看，门已经打开了。¤Look, the door is already open.
你不正是为此而来的么，这传承便是那名扬天下的《玄清天衍录》。¤Didn't you come here for this? This inheritance is the famous Xuan Qing Tian Yan Lu.
老夫有一死敌，平日里倒也不怕他，但前些日子怪我贪心，想要夺那巫山的仙蛊天锣，便和那蛊真人打了一架。¤The old man has a mortal enemy, and I am not afraid of him usually, but I blamed myself for being greedy a few days ago, and wanted to seize the Immortal Gu Tiangong in Wushan, so I had a fight with the real Gu.
这...这是巫山的虫蛊！你什么时候...？¤This...this is Wushan's Insect Gu! When did you...?
老夫孤身一人，没有什么门派约束，你若是敢帮我这个忙，我这身修行的法门就是传授给你也无妨，如何？¤The old man is alone, and there is no discipline. If you dare to do me this favor, it doesn't hurt to teach you the method of my practice, how about it?
师兄...把噬血珠交出来，我不想与你为难。¤Brother... hand over the Blood Devouring Bead, I don't want to embarrass you.
前辈的大敌定是修为高深，晚辈又能做什么呢？¤Senior's enemy must be a high level of cultivation, what can juniors do?
桀桀桀桀，这通心蛊是巫山十大蛊中发作最快的一种，以你的修为，没两个时辰，是压制不住的。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie, this Tongxin Gu is the fastest one among the ten great Gu in Wushan. With your cultivation base, within two hours, it can't be suppressed.
你这{xiaozi}眼珠子总是骨碌碌乱转，倒也是个心思灵巧之人。¤Your {xiaozi} eyes are always turbulent, but you are also a smart person.
（这老道神识远高于我，修为深不可测，说话行事又颇为乖癖，我该怎么应答？）¤(This old man's spiritual awareness is far higher than mine, his cultivation is unfathomable, and he speaks and acts in a peculiar manner, how should I respond?)
不过...你这{xiaozi}来的倒巧，老子恰好遇到点麻烦，你若是能帮我办好这件事，老夫也不会亏待你。¤But... it's a coincidence that you {xiaozi} came here. I happened to be in trouble. If you can help me with this, I won't treat you badly.
{vpunch=10,0.5}轰！！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5} Boom!!!
哪家的{xiaozi}这么不长眼，打搅老子修炼，难道没看到这庙前有老夫留下的印记么？¤Which {xiaozi} is so short-sighted and disturbs Lao Tzu's cultivation, don't you see the mark left by the old man in front of this temple?
你一个炼气期的{xiaozi}，他必然不会在意，等时机一到，你便服下这颗丹药，偷袭于他，定能见效。¤You {xiaozi} in the refining period, he will definitely not care. When the time comes, you will take this pill and sneak on him, and it will be effective.
这颗“血煞丹”是老夫从巫山换得的秘药，有短暂提升修为的作用，你且收着。若是我那死敌真的寻来，我自有办法与他周旋。¤This Bloodrend Pill is the secret medicine that this old man exchanged from Mt Wu. It can temporarily improve the user's cultivation. Take it. If my mortal enemy finds us, I have my methods to deal with him.
我这伤估计还得有一段时间才能养好，这段时间，你便与老夫一同住在这破庙里。¤I still need some time to recover from this injury, during this period, you will live with the old man in this broken temple.
桀桀桀桀，你倒是爽快。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie, you are refreshing.
哼，我有教主大人赐我的凤血魔袍，你剩下这几成功力，又能奈我何？便让你多活两个时辰。¤I have the Phoenix Blood Demon Cloak given to me by the Lord, what can you do with the few percent of your power left? I will let you live for two more hours.
呵，这破庙有什么好，老子若不是受了点伤，一时也没地方可去，怎么会待在这儿。¤Heh, what's so good about this ruined temple? If I hadn't been injured a little and had nowhere to go for a while, how could I stay here?
天邪子，你不好好地做你那古神教的护教护法，一路追着老子来了宁州，真是辛苦你了。¤Tian Xiezi, you didn't stay as a Guardian of your ancient gods, and chased me all the way to Ning Province. It must have been hard for you.
是，晚辈记下了！¤I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a job.
{vpunch=10,0.5}咳咳...咳咳...¤{vpunch=10,0.5} ahem... ahem...
多谢前辈！¤Thank you senior!
嘿，那小子的法门很是邪道，不知对老子用了什么蛊术，令我这一身功力散去了七七八八，如今若是再被我那死敌寻到，肯定不是他的对手。¤Hey, that kid's method is very evil. I don't know what Gu technique was used against Lao Tzu, which made me lose all my power. Now if it is found by my mortal enemy again, it is definitely not his opponent.
前辈这般修为高深的修士，却躲在这处破庙里疗伤，恐怕这麻烦不小吧？¤Senior, a cultivator with such a high level of cultivation, is hiding in this ruined temple to heal his injuries. I'm afraid this is not a small trouble, right?
晚辈修为浅薄，恐怕帮不上前辈什么忙。¤The juniors are shallow in cultivation, I'm afraid they won't be able to help the seniors much.
罢了，这事你若不愿，老夫强求也是无用，你自行离开便是了。¤No matter, if you don't want this matter, it's useless for the old man to force it. Just leave by yourself.
天邪子，你那一套假惺惺的模样，对老子可不管用。这噬血珠是认主的法宝，老子若是没死，你根本操控不了它。¤Tian Xiezi, your hypocritical appearance doesn't work for Lao Tzu. This blood-devouring orb is a magic weapon to recognize the Lord. If Lao Tzu is not dead, you can't control it at all.
晚辈只是想找个地方暂住几日，没想到冲撞了前辈，这...这便离去。¤The junior just wanted to find a place to stay for a few days, but I didn't expect to run into the senior, this...this left.
哈哈哈，师兄，那蛊真人使的黑丝蛊，可是天下奇毒，你现在还能剩下几成功力？¤Hahaha, brother, the black silk gu of the real Gu, but the world is so poisonous, how much success do you have left now?
我本想与师兄叙叙旧，既然师兄你没有这个意思，那师弟我便送你上路吧！¤I wanted to reminisce about the old with brother, since brother you didn't mean that, then brother, I will send you on the road!
噢？那你不妨运气试试。¤Oh? Then you might as well try your luck.
（此时正是出手的大好时机！）¤(This is a good time to make a shot!)
若是晚辈有能出的上力的地方，定当全力而为！¤If the younger generation has a place where they can exert their strength, they must do their best!
你这段时间就待在庙里{color=red}休息{/color}，不要出去走动了。¤You will stay in the temple {color=red} resting {/color} during this time, don't go out and walk around.
你注意到原本通向地阵眼空间的传送阵变得黯淡无光，应该是无法继续使用了。¤You notice that the original teleportation array leading to the Earth Formation Eye space has become dull, and should not be able to continue using it.
是否前往地阵眼？¤Do you want to go to the earth formation eye?
公孙季说完示意大家可以去尝试破阵了，你也选定一个阵眼前往。¤Gongsun Ji finished saying that everyone can try to break the formation, you also choose a formation to go.
据说其中地阵眼是杀阵所在，而南方灼热无比，在下估摸着便是了。至于其他两个阵眼，天当与地相对，人居两者之中。¤It is said that the eye of the ground formation is where the killing formation is located, and the south is extremely hot, so I guess it is. As for the other two formations, heaven is opposite to the earth, and humans live in the two.
该阵分天地人三大阵眼，只需破解所有阵眼，此阵立破。¤The formation is divided into three major formations of heaven, earth and people. You only need to crack all the formations and this formation will be broken.
诸位莫慌，据在下所知，现在我们处于涵虚仙人所设阵法中。此阵虽具备灵气循坏，有生生不息之效能。但经上百年，其威能仍是被削弱许多。¤Don’t panic, everyone, as far as I know, we are now in the formation set up by the Hanxu immortal. Although this formation has aura circulation and has the effect of endless life. But after hundreds of years, its power is still weakened a lot. .
你细细观察之后发现，周遭灵气火旺金衰，阵法空间里也因此灼热无比，其中以南方的烧灼感最为强烈。¤After you observe carefully, you find that the surrounding spiritual energy is flaming and golden, and the formation space is also extremely hot because of this, and the burning sensation in the south is the strongest.
你们顺利通过护府大阵进入仙府后，只见所处环境瞬间转换，大家已然处于仙府内部的另一个阵法中。¤After you successfully entered the Immortal Mansion through the Guardian Palace, you saw that your environment instantly changed, and everyone was already in another formation within the Immortal Mansion.
是否前往人阵眼（左）？¤Do you want to go to the Eye of Human Formation (left)?
是否前往天阵眼？¤Do you want to go to the Eye of Heaven?
是否前往人阵眼（右）？¤Do you want to go to the human formation eye (right)?
是否回到涵虚仙府主阵法？¤Do you want to return to the main formation of Hanxu Immortal Mansion?
你无意中发现一枚火属性妖丹。¤You inadvertently found a fire attribute demon pellet.
你发现一块稀有妖兽的逆鳞。见左右无人，你迅速将之收入囊中。¤You found a piece of rare Spirit Beast's reverse scale. Seeing that no one is around, you quickly pocket it.
你刚进入天阵眼，便发现地上满是残破的傀儡，显然有人已经将入口清理了一番。¤As soon as you entered the sky, you found that the ground was full of broken puppets. Apparently someone had cleared the entrance.
你阵道修为太低，看不出什么门道来。¤Your formation dao cultivation is too low to see what's going on.
让你奇怪的是，这种布阵手法让你觉得很是熟悉却又想不起来在哪见过。¤What's strange is that you feel familiar with this formation technique but you can't remember where you've seen it before.
走上前去却只发现被破除的阵法和满地的傀儡残骸。¤You walk up and find only broken formations and the remains of puppets all over the ground.
你发现前方有阵法波动。¤You notice a formation fluctuation in front of you.
经过感知后你发现此处曾布下的是集困、幻、杀一体的阵法或是多重阵法，虽比涵虚仙府的阵法弱上不止一筹，但也是高明的布阵手法。¤After perceiving it, you find out that the formation that was laid here is a combination of trapping, illusion and killing formation or multiple formations, which is more than a chip weaker than the one in Hanxu Immortal Mansion, but it is also a brilliant formation technique.
你仔细检查残骸，发现全都是因高温而融毁，估计是离火门的修士所为。¤You carefully examine the wreckage and find that all are melted and destroyed by the high temperature, presumably by the cultivators of the Heavenly Fire Gate.
你观战了一会，发现百里奇等人不但没击破阵法核心，反倒受伤不轻。倒是他们退下时，阵法核心也变得暗淡起来，并没有追击。¤You watched the battle for a while, and found that Baili Qi and others not only did not break the core of the formation, but also injured. On the contrary, when they retreated, the formation core also became dark, and did not chase.
稍远处传来神通轰击阵法的声音，走近一看，原来是百里奇等人在尝试以力破阵。¤A little farther away came the sound of divine powers bombarding the formation, and when you get closer, it turns out that Bailiqi and others are trying to break the formation with force.
前进一段时间后，你在附近发现了几个照顾伤者的修士，正是李青麟，慕容颖等人。¤After advancing for some time, you found several cultivators tending to the wounded nearby, none other than Li Qinglin, Murong Ying and others.
你观察了一会，发现自己完全看不懂这个阵法的路数。¤You observe for a while and find that you can't understand the number of ways of this formation at all.
观察许久后，你自认为看破了此阵。走上前去，随意一挥手便是灵力澎湃而出轰击在核心薄弱部位。只听“咔嚓“一声，后者也是随之碎裂。¤After observing for a long time, you think you have seen through this formation. Walking forward, a casual wave of your hand is the spiritual power surging out to blast at the core weak part. Just hear the click sound, the latter is also broken.
在你的灵气终于耗尽后，不论是体外的皮肤、毛发，还是体内的经脉、气海都已经燃烧起来。若是不能及时回到公孙季的阵法中，只怕一时三刻间便是要化为飞灰。¤After your aura is finally exhausted, the skin and hair outside, the meridians and the sea of ​​qi in the body have been burned. If you can’t return to Gongsun Ji’s formation in time, I’m afraid it will happen in a moment or three. To be turned into fly ash.
{FirstName}{gongzi}，在下感到此间阵法出现了变动，只怕有什么东西要出来了。¤{FirstName}{gongzi}, I feel that there has been a change in the formation here, I am afraid that something will come out.
你忙活一阵后，发现这个阵法空间中的狂暴灵气已然平息，与外界无异。¤After you have been busy for a while, you find that the violent aura in this formation space has subsided, and it is no different from the outside world.
在不知走了多久后，你的灵气护盾终是在狂暴灵气的冲击下碎裂开来。灼热的阵法空间如同火焰炼狱一般，甚至让你感觉经脉都要燃烧起来了。但也只能运功护身，咬牙前进。¤After walking for a long time, your aura shield finally shattered under the impact of violent aura. The hot array space is like flame purgatory, and it even makes you feel that the meridians are about to burn. But it only Be able to protect your body, grit your teeth and move forward.
{vpunch=10,0.5}（这里灵气过于狂暴，我要多多留意{color=#d0380a}自身体力{/color}为上！）¤{vpunch=10,0.5}(The aura here is too violent, I need to pay more attention to {color=#d0380a}self-strength{/color} first!)
随着不断地前进，你感到阵法空间内的灵气也愈发狂暴，好在你实力够强，还不至于被影响行动。¤As you continue to advance, you feel that the aura in the formation space becomes more and more violent. Fortunately, you are strong enough to not be affected by your actions.
在这个炼狱里，你已经只剩这一个念头了。¤In this purgatory, you have only this thought left.
正当你松一口气时，一个火焰裹挟着的傀儡向你冲来。¤Just as you breathed a sigh of relief, a puppet wrapped in flames rushed towards you.
还请你再加快些速度，尽量多解除几个阵法核心。¤Please increase your speed a little bit and remove as many formation cores as possible.
正当你准备休息一会时，一个傀儡向你袭来。¤Just as you were about to take a break, a puppet attacked you.
（前进...前进...前进...）¤(Forward...forward...forward...)
你忙活一阵后，发现这个阵法空间中的灵气消退许多，令人窒息的灼热感也渐渐消散。¤After you have been busy for a while, you find that the aura in this formation space has faded a lot, and the suffocating burning sensation has gradually dissipated.
你在神通的保护下来到公孙季身边，发现他早已在此设下一个不知名阵法，不但隔绝了外界的狂暴灵气，甚至还有恢复的功效。¤You came to Gongsun Ji under the protection of supernatural powers and found that he had already set up an unknown formation here, which not only isolates the violent spirit of the outside world, but also has the effect of restoration.
在下刚才探寻到三个阵法核心，但由于此间灵气过于狂暴，在下没来得及将之关闭，只得回到入口设下疗伤阵法，再从长计议。¤Xia Xia just explored the three core formations, but because the aura here was too violent, Xia Xia didn't have time to close them, so I had to go back to the entrance and set up the healing formations, and then consider the long term.
刚踏入地阵眼的传送阵，灼热的灵气浪潮几乎将你压倒在地。还好你下意识地使用神通护住自身，所以几乎没有受伤。¤Just stepping into the teleportation formation of the ground, the scorching wave of aura almost overwhelmed you to the ground. Fortunately, you subconsciously used magical powers to protect yourself, so there was almost no injury.
体力-1¤Physical Strength-1
{FirstName}{gongzi}请来这边。¤{FirstName}{gongzi}, please come here.
但是在下需要花费一点时间疗伤，不如{FirstName}{gongzi}前去关闭阵法核心，在下于此维持阵法接应{FirstName}{gongzi}。¤But I need to spend a little time healing, so why don't {FirstName}{gongzi} go ahead and close the formation core, and I will maintain the formation here to receive {FirstName}{gongzi}.
你发现了一个阵法机关，并轻而易举地击毁了。¤You found a formation organ and destroyed it easily.
你发现一个阵法机关，并轻而易举地击毁了。¤You found a formation organ and destroyed it easily.
你发现一个阵法机关，并轻而易举地摧毁了。¤You find a formation organ and destroy it with ease.
是否回到涵虚主阵法？¤Does it return to the main Hanxu formation?
你说完发现处于另一个空间的倪旭欣并没有听你说完，早已不知道跑哪里去了。¤After you finish talking, you find that Ni XuXin, who is in another dimension, didn't listen to you. I don't know where to go anymore.
我们走的方向确实是相反的，而且应该只是能互相感觉到，而不是在一个空间才对。也不知涵虚仙人葫芦里卖的什么药。¤We are going in the opposite direction, and we should only be able to feel each other, not in the same space. I don't know what medicine is sold in Xuxian Gourd.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你不是去另一个人阵眼了么，怎么会出现在我这边。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, didn't you go to another person to fight, why did you show up on my side.
一阵眩晕后，你被传送到另一个阵法空间。令人讶异的是，你居然可以感受到另一个人阵眼中发生的事情。¤After a stun, you are teleported to another formation space. Surprisingly, you can actually feel what is happening in the eyes of another formation.
你来到人阵眼所在之处，却只看到一个传送阵。稍有犹豫之后，径直跨入其中。¤You came to the place where the eyes of the human formation were, but only saw a teleportation formation. After a little hesitation, you went straight into it.
你注意到阵法空间中灵气浓度逐渐增加，约摸着是到了人阵眼核心附近了。找准方向后不久便发现核心所在。¤You noticed a gradual increase in the concentration of aura in the formation space, and it was probably near the core of the human formation. After finding the correct direction, you found the core.
你无意中发现一块三星石。¤You unintentionally found a three-star stone.
这次真是伤得不轻...¤It's really hurt this time...
女子突然大叫一声，你吓了一跳，连忙转身戒备，然而眼前却空无一物¤The woman suddenly yelled, you were taken aback, and you turned around to be on guard, but there was nothing in front of you.
{shidi}，莫怪师姐心狠，这秘密，自然是知道的人越少越好...¤{shidi}, don’t blame Senior Sister for being cruel, this secret is naturally the less people who know the better...
啊！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Ah! {vpunch=10,0.5}
{shidi}，小心身后！¤{shidi}, be careful behind you!
正当你觉得奇怪之时，身后剑声已至，你低头一看，一柄利剑已经穿透了你的胸膛，鲜血顺着剑尖往下流淌...你身体一软，便倒在了地上。¤Just when you feel strange, the sound of the sword behind you has arrived. When you look down, a sharp sword has penetrated your chest, and the blood is flowing down the tip of the sword... When your body is soft, you fall down. To the ground.
发生什么事了，你们是被何人所伤？¤What happened, who hurt you?
谁？¤Who?
这个...额...此事说来话长...¤This... uh... this is a long story...
师兄，师姐，我也是竹山宗内弟子，奉命在矿脉巡逻。¤Senior Brother, Senior Sister, I am also a disciple of the Bamboo Mountain Sect, and I have been ordered to patrol the veins.
你无意中发现一株月灵花。\n¤You unintentionally found a Moonspirit Blossom. \n
闻言你也尝试着用神识探查了一番，也没有其他发现。便带头深入探查。¤Smell you also try to use the soul sense to explore some, and no other findings. Then take the lead to explore deeper.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我刚用神识探查了一番却发现这树的垂根竟能隔绝探查，在这也未发现煞气，看来得深入一番才能有所得了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, I just used the soul sense to explore some but found that the tree's hanging roots can actually isolate the probe, in this also did not find the brake gas, it seems to have to go deeper to get something.
海上的漩涡竟是因这大树而起，但也没看它有多大动作,如此伟力真是令人称奇。¤The whirlpool on the sea is actually due to this tree, but did not see it has much action, so great power is really amazing.
除了一棵占满你视野的古树外再无它物。没有预期中的仙府或是遗迹，只有如云的顶盖，似定海神柱的茎干，由树枝而下自成迷林的垂根，在海底俨然自成一界。¤In addition to an ancient tree that fills your field of vision, there is nothing else. There is no expected immortal residence or relics, only the top cover like a cloud, like the stem of the pillar of the sea, from the branches of the tree and down to form a mysterious forest of hanging roots, in the bottom of the sea just like a world of its own.
以前在无尽之海游历时，你也不是没深入到海底过，但眼前的场景却超乎你的预期。¤Previously in the endless sea travel, you are not not deep to the bottom of the sea, but the scene in front of you is beyond your expectations.
你们二人仗着自身实力，半途便强行脱离了漩涡，没有选择直达起源而是选择了一个相对安全的距离先观望一番。¤The two of you, relying on your own strength, forced your way out of the whirlpool halfway through, not choosing to go straight to the origin but choosing a relatively safe distance to watch first.
你一边思考着，一边冲着倪旭欣可能前进的方向走去，却发现身后那截断裂的根须竟是扫了过来。¤You ponder while rushing in the direction where Ni XuXin might be advancing, only to find that the broken root whisker behind you actually swept over.
（难道倪兄在刚才的攻击中发现了什么，所以没有等我稳定神魂便已经先行追上去了？那我也快追上去吧。）¤（Could it be that Brother Ni found something in the attack just now, so he didn't wait for me to stabilize my divine soul and already went after him first? Then I'll go after him too.）
倪兄，这神识...¤Brother Ni, this soul sense...
当你满是疑惑的准备与倪旭欣交流一番时，却发现附近根本没有他的身影，除了垂下的根须，剩下的，只有断裂的根须，其中一根还离你很近。¤When you are full of doubts and ready to communicate with Ni XuXin, you find that there is no figure of him nearby, except for the dangling roots, the rest, only broken roots, one of which is still very close to you.
你强行稳住状态，但预期的下一波攻击并没有如期而至。¤You forcefully stabilize your state, but the expected next wave of attacks does not arrive as expected.
当你满是疑惑的准备与倪旭欣交流一番时，却发现前方一个身影一闪而过，身边的倪旭欣也是早已不见。¤When you are full of doubts and ready to communicate with Ni XuXin for a while, you find a figure flashing in front of you, and Ni XuXin beside you is also long gone.
倪兄可是在刚才的攻击中发现了什么？嗯，我还是尽快追上去吧。¤Ni brother but in the attack just now found something? Well, I'd better catch up as soon as possible.
你强行稳住状态，但预期的下一波攻击并没有如期而至。反而是你感到自己对五行大道的领悟又上了一个层次。¤You forcefully stabilize your state, but the expected next wave of attacks does not arrive as expected. Instead, you felt that your comprehension of the Five Elemental Dao had gone up another level.
就在你打算与倪旭欣商量一下加速前进时，不知从何处来的神识攻击让你神魂受到剧烈冲击，乃至一阵眩晕，不得不停下未说完的话语，强行凝心静气稳住神魂。¤Just when you plan to discuss with Ni XuXin to speed up your progress, the soul sense attack from nowhere makes your soul suffer a violent impact and even a dizziness, and you have to stop your unfinished words and forcefully concentrate your mind to stabilize your soul.
倪兄，这垂根外围貌似没有什么危险，不如我们...¤Ni brother, this hanging root periphery seems to be no danger, why don't we ...
在前进了一段时间后，你们离古树核心的距离也是越来越近，但依旧没有类似煞气的发现。¤After advancing for a period of time, the distance between you and the core of the ancient tree is getting closer and closer, but there is still no discovery similar to the evil spirit.
闻言，你赶忙审视自身状态，这才发现古树不知何时{color=#d0380a}扎根{/color}在了你身上！但显然倪旭欣的情况明显更严重一些，所以是整个人都被树根包裹住的状态。¤Upon hearing this, you rush to examine your own state, only to discover that the ancient tree had somehow {color=#d0380a} rooted {/color} in you! But apparently Ni XuXin's situation is obviously a bit more serious, so is the state of the entire person is wrapped in the roots of the tree.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}别愣着了！古树在寄生我们！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}Don't freeze! The ancient tree is parasitizing us!
犹豫间，疑似倪旭欣的根须居然是用剑气攻击了自身。但没有起到什么效果，就像是倪旭欣真用剑气攻击了古树的根须一般。¤Hesitantly, the suspected Ni XuXin's roots actually attacked itself with Sword Qi. But it did not have any effect, as if Ni XuXin really attacked the ancient tree's root whiskers with Sword Qi.
（这...难道倪兄也陷入幻觉？所以准备攻击我？）¤（This... Could it be that Brother Ni also fell into an illusion? So he is ready to attack me?）
你还在思考时，那截根须已经是剑气外放，俨然是倪旭欣准备全力攻击时的架势。¤While you are still thinking about it, the root whisker is already letting out Sword Qi, just like when Ni XuXin is preparing to attack with full force.
（又是幻觉！！？）¤（Another hallucination!?）
在倪旭欣的呼喊中你迅速脱离思考状态，却发现眼前本该是倪少位置的，居然又是断裂的神树根须！¤At Ni XuXin's shout you quickly get out of your thinking state, only to find that what should have been Ni Shao's position in front of you is actually the broken root of the divine tree again!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}！小心！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}! Watch out!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
海底古树旁的两人陷入了沉思。¤The two people by the ancient tree at the bottom of the sea were in deep thought.
但他们若是能活着出去，无尽之海的修士对漩涡底下的情况应该会了解更多才对。¤But if they could get out alive, the cultivators of the Endless Sea should know more about the situation underneath the whirlpool.
仔细想来，我们一路走到这里，除了幻觉也没有遭遇过其他的危险...¤Come to think of it, we've come all the way here and haven't encountered any danger other than illusions...
能活着到海底的修士应该主要是在幻觉中互相残杀至死的，但...那些单独被卷入海底的修士又是怎么陨落的呢？¤The cultivators who made it to the bottom of the sea alive should have mainly killed each other to death in the illusion, but... How did those cultivators who were swept to the bottom of the sea alone fall?
所以那些被漩涡吸入的人都是在幻觉中死去的？¤So those who were sucked in by the whirlpool died in an illusion?
不，恐怕这里从来都没有什么魔剑，至于我们之前猜测的煞气，也只是就是刚才遇到过的幻觉。¤No, I'm afraid there was never any magic sword here, and as for our previous speculation about the fury, it was just an illusion that we had just encountered.
难道魔剑在这树干里？¤Could the magic sword be in the trunk of this tree?
这里好像并没有煞气或者类似的异象，更不用说魔剑了，难道...¤There does not seem to be a fury or similar visions here, let alone the magic sword, could it be...
二人一路小心提防，终于是来到了神树茎干前。¤The two of them were careful all the way to the stalk of the divine tree and finally arrived at it.
（这...倪兄不会是又中招了吧？但这次没有神识攻击，应该...是不同情况。）¤（This... Brother Ni is not hit again, right? But this time there is no soul sense attack, should... It's a different situation.）
（难道，我陷入幻觉了？那我应该等他帮我解开幻觉，还是说尝试下自救？）¤（Could it be, that I fell into an illusion? （Should I wait for him to help me out of the illusion, or should I try to save myself?
在倪旭欣的呼喊中你迅速脱离思考状态，却发现眼前本该是倪少位置的，居然是断裂的神树根须！¤At Ni XuXin's shout you quickly break out of your thinking state, only to find that what should have been Ni Shao's location in front of you is actually a broken divine tree root whisker!
你好不容易追上倪旭欣，他却直接对你展开了攻击。¤You have a hard time catching up to Ni XuXin, but he attacks you directly.
附近没有倪旭欣的身影，估计是已经走远了。倒是有几朵道蕴流转的小花长在根须之上。¤There is no Ni XuXin's figure nearby, so I guess he has gone far away. On the contrary, there are several small flowers with Dao implication flowing growing on top of the root beard.
你顺手将小花摘下放入储物袋中。¤You smoothly pick the small flowers into the storage bag.
哼，那就来吧。¤Hmph, let's do it then.
噢？我看不出有什么理由要把这里让给你，有本事赢了我再说。¤Oh? I don't see any reason to give this place to you, win me if you can.
{$NickName}名声在外，我早有听闻。既然你开口了，今日我便卖你这个面子，请吧。¤{$NickName} has a reputation, I've heard of it. Now that you have spoken, I will sell your face today, please.
我看上这里的矿脉了，不知道友可否割爱，把这里让给我？¤I like the veins here, I wonder if you can give me this place?
噢？我看不出有什么理由要把这里让给你。¤Oh? I don't see any reason to give this place to you.
既然道友你有需要，那我让与你便是，请！¤Since you need it, I'll let you have it, please!
我看上这里的矿脉了，按规矩来比试比试吧。谁赢了，这里就归谁。¤I like the vein here, let's have a competition according to the rules. Whoever wins, the place will be yours.
既然是{$NickName}你有需要，那我让与你便是，请！¤Since it's {$NickName} you need it, then I'll give it to you, please!
在下自然不是前辈的对手，不劳您动手，在下自己离开便是...¤I am naturally not a match for you, so I don't need you to do it, I will leave myself...
映入眼帘的是一方水池。¤The pond that meets the eye is a pond.
道友稍后。¤Daoist later.
有劳了。¤Thank you.
请~¤Please~
此次药浴的材料由我承担，为了感谢{FirstName}道友为我龙族前后奔波。¤The materials for this medicinal bath are on my shoulders, and as a thank you to {FirstName}Daoist friends for running backwards and forwards for my dragon family.
先祖九玄在创出引雷锻体之法后，于阵内设有药池以雷电之力辅助吸收重元换血的药性，这样虽没有雷鸣海九霄雷狱的功效，但却也胜在稳扎稳打过程并无危险¤After our ancestor Jiu Xuan created the method of attracting lightning to forge the body, he set up a medicinal pool within the formation to assist in absorbing the medicinal properties of the reborn blood with the power of lightning.
只见他一掐法诀，上百株鲜红的药草从他的储物袋飞出，化作药液进入眼前的水池，一阵浓郁的药香弥散在空中。¤As soon as he saw the magic trick, hundreds of bright red medicinal herbs flew out from his storage bag and turned into medicinal liquid into the pool in front of him, and a strong medicinal fragrance filled the air.
你方一入阵，四周的引雷柱就开始运转，阵法的上方凝聚了一片雷云。¤As soon as your party entered the formation, the lightning pillars around you began to operate, and a thunder cloud coalesced above the formation.
“轰”¤'Boom.''
不愧是{FirstName}道友，锻体的效果很是不错。¤Not bad for a {FirstName} daoist, the forging of the body is very good.
一道雷电命中你的肉身，狂暴肆虐的能量在你的体内游走，此时药池中的药液也包裹住你不断的修复你的肉身，在不断的破坏与新生中你明显感觉到肉身强度在提升。¤A lightning bolt hits your flesh and the violent and rampant energy swims through your body, at this time the medicinal liquid in the medicinal pool also wraps around you constantly repairing your flesh, in the constant destruction and renewal you clearly feel the strength of your flesh increasing.
嗯？¤Very?
没想到{FirstName}道友已是登峰造极的体修大家了，之前倒是我班门弄斧了。¤I didn't realize that {FirstName}DaoYou are already a great practitioner of physical training.
一道雷电命中你的肉身，但是以你在体道的修为这雷电完全不能伤你分毫，其中蕴含的能量被你全数吸收，此时药池中的药液也包裹住你，其中的药力不断被吸收。¤A lightning bolt hits your flesh, but with your cultivation in the Body Dao this lightning bolt cannot hurt you at all, the energy contained in it is all absorbed by you, at this time the medicinal liquid in the pool also wraps around you, the medicinal power in it is continuously absorbed.
之后如此往复又来了八道天雷，对你而言波澜不惊的渡过了。¤After that there were eight more thunderbolts, which passed without a hitch for you.
此时你更感觉到这天雷中的能量一部分被体内的九龙天雷火所吸收。¤At this moment you feel even more that part of the energy in this heavenly thunder is absorbed by the Nine Dragons Heavenly Thunder Flame inside your body.
你伸出左掌九龙天雷火出现在掌心，在火焰四周不断有电花涌动，一缕无形的能量没入火焰，随后火焰的焰色逐渐变成纯粹的橙红色，散发一阵天地之威。¤You stretch out your left palm and the Nine Dragons Heavenly Thunder Flame appears in your palm, around the flame there is a constant surge of electricity, a wisp of invisible energy enters the flame, then the flame's flame colour gradually turns pure orange-red, emitting a burst of heaven and earth's might.
此时一股空灵的能量游离在九龙天雷火周围。¤At this moment an ethereal energy wandered around the Nine Dragons Heavenly Thunder Flame.
嘶~九天劫火！！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Hiss~ The Nine Heavens Robbery Fire!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
我还要留在这里维护阵法，不送了。¤I have to stay here to maintain the formation, so I won't send it off.
不过这仅是假设，引雷锻体一生仅有第一次有效果，这个假设连大圣自己都没有达成。恭喜道友了，获得这等异火真是令人羡慕。¤However, this is only an assumption, inducing lightning to forge the body only has an effect for the first time in one's life, an assumption that even the Great Sage himself has not reached. Congratulations, Fellow Daoist, to obtain such a special fire is truly enviable.
先祖九玄曾在随笔中假设，我族九龙天雷火源自雷鸣海九霄雷狱中的劫火，若是有人身怀此火入阵锻体若是捕捉到那一缕先天之气可使体内异火进化为先天劫火。¤Our ancestor Jiu Xuan once hypothesized in his writing that our Nine Dragons Heavenly Thunder Flame originated from the robbery fire in the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison of the Thunder Sea, and that if someone carries this fire into the formation to forge his body if he captures a wisp of the innate Qi he can evolve his body into the innate robbery fire.
道友何事？¤What's the matter with fellow Taoists?
还是先前往化龙池吧。¤Let's go to Hualongchi first.
你感受到血脉深处似有什么被引动了。¤You feel something deep in your bloodline that seems to be triggered.
道友，快！！！¤Daoist, hurry up! ! !
说罢，只见其于体内飞出一道法印飞向龙珠，并施展法术。¤After all, I saw that it flew out a seal in the body and flew to the Dragon Ball, and cast a spell.
道友，请进入化龙池，切记不要抵抗这龙珠之中的龙脉之力。¤Fellow Daoist, please enter the Dragon Transformation Pond, and remember not to resist the power of the dragon veins in this dragon ball.
你看到敖玄浮于半空之中，他身旁便是龙珠，海量精纯的龙脉之力从中磅礴而出。¤You see Ao Xuan floating in mid-air, and beside him is the Dragon Ball, from which a vast amount of pure Dragon Vein power comes out.
忽然，周围的龙脉之力，成气旋状向你体内涌入。¤Suddenly, the power of the surrounding dragon veins pours into your body in a cyclone.
嗯？这是？¤Huh? This is?
哈哈哈，没想到道友竟身怀我龙族血脉乃是我龙族旁支，也不知为何此前我竟没有发现。¤Hahaha, I didn't expect that fellow Daoist actually carries my dragon bloodline, which is a side branch of my dragon family, and I don't know why I didn't find it before.
既如此在下便助道友一臂之力。¤That being the case, I will help fellow Daoists.
只见其逼出一滴精血飞入你的额头，精血没入之后你逐渐陷入了空灵状态。¤I saw that it forced a drop of blood essence into your forehead, and after the blood essence submerged, you gradually fell into an ethereal state.
道友终于醒了，看道友的状态应是大有收获，敖玄就恭喜道友了。¤Daoist you're finally awake, looking at your state you seem to have made great gains, Ao Xuan congratulates you.
远处一道遁光向你飞来。¤A distant light is flying towards you.
此番机缘全凭道友成全，这份人情我记下了。¤This opportunity is all fulfilled by fellow Taoists, and I have written down this favor.
道友客气了，我先走一步，道友若是有事可以来皇龙殿找我。¤Daoist friend is polite, I will take a step first. If you have any business, Daoist friend can come to the Emperor Dragon Hall to find me.
道友不要抗拒，让龙脉之力为你淬体。¤Do not resist, fellow Daoist, let the power of the dragon veins temper your body.
周围的龙脉之力疯狂的向你体内涌入。¤The power of the surrounding dragon veins pours into your body frantically.
九幽数百米长的触手蜷缩于此，一动不动。它的伤势似乎很重，甚至没有发现你已经追了过来。你决定...？¤The hundreds of meters long tentacles of the Nine Ghosts are curled up here, motionless. It seems to be so badly injured that it didn't even notice that you had come after it. You decide...?
你全力运转神通，向九幽攻去。谁知这蓄势一击竟似打在空气中一般，九幽的躯体化作一团黑雾倏然散开，几息之间便将你笼罩在其中。¤You use your divine power to attack the Nine Ghosts. But the momentum of the strike seemed to hit the air, the body of the nine ghosts into a black mist abruptly dispersed, a few breaths will envelop you in it.
你心下一惊，连忙向后闪去，想要离开这团诡异的黑雾，却发现不知何时，双脚已被九幽的触手紧紧缠住，动弹不得！¤You were shocked, and quickly dodged backwards to get away from the strange black fog, but found that somehow, both feet have been tightly entangled by the tentacles of the nine ghosts, can not move!
九幽作为无尽之海四大妖圣之一，恐怕没有这么简单就被打败，你决定小心试探一番。¤As one of the Four Great Demon Saints of the Endless Sea, I'm afraid that the Nine Specters are not so easily defeated, and you decide to test it carefully.
你随手掐了一个小法诀，向九幽攻去。谁知这道法术竟似打在空气中一般，九幽的躯体化作一团黑雾倏然散开。¤You casually choked a small spell and attacked the Nine Ghosts. Who knows that this spell seems to hit the air, the body of the nine ghosts into a black mist abruptly scattered.
你早有防备，闪身躲过了暗中向你伸来的数条触须，但转瞬之间已被滚滚黑雾笼罩在了其中。¤You have been prepared, dodging several tentacles to you, but in a flash has been rolled in the black fog enveloped in it.
对方深吸一口气，似是下了什么决定。¤The other party took a deep breath, as if he had made a decision.
对方松了一口气，开口说道。¤The other party breathed a sigh of relief and said.
道友可知，我龙族的客卿？¤Do you know, the guest of my dragon clan?
而我龙族的客卿，不仅可以去我族坤龙殿交易我龙族宝物、功法典籍，若是贡献突出还可以前往化龙池，进行一场化龙血浴。¤And the guest of my dragon clan can not only go to our clan's Kunlong Palace to trade my dragon clan treasures and manuals, but also go to the Dragon Transformation Pond for a blood bath if the contribution is outstanding.
我龙族虽是孤悬于海外，但是若有外族强者能获得我族的认可，也可以成为我龙族的客卿。¤Although my dragon clan is isolated overseas, if there are strong foreigners who can gain the approval of my clan, they can also become the guest of my dragon clan.
坤龙殿乃是我龙族宝库，其中不仅仅有我龙族自己的独有之物，更有我族自上古年间收集的奇珍异宝。¤The Kun Long Hall is a treasure trove for our dragon clan, containing not only our own unique items, but also the exotic treasures that our clan has collected since the ancient times.
我龙族有一套传承自上古的秘法，介以化龙池之中的龙珠浴血跃龙门，自身能融合一丝龙族血脉，百里家初代家主便是如此。¤My dragon family has a set of secret methods that have been inherited from ancient times. The dragon ball in the Dragon Transformation Pond is bathed in blood and jumps over the dragon gate.
道友可愿意成为我族客卿。¤Daoyou may be willing to become our clan's Guest?
{xiaozi}，可别冲动，这龙族可是有化神妖圣坐镇，能让他们这么大出血，这差事肯定不简单。¤{xiaozi}, don't be impulsive, this dragon clan has Deity Transformation demons to make them bleed so much, this job is definitely not easy.
嗯（我应该...）¤Hmm (I should...)
龙族乃是海上霸主，更有四大妖圣之一的覆海大圣坐镇，也需要我这一介外人？道友若不如实道来，恕我不能答应。¤The Dragon Clan is the dominant power on the sea and has one of the Four Great Demon Saints, the Great Sage of the Oversea, sitting in its place. If you do not tell me the truth, I cannot agree.
龙族乃是海上霸主，更有四大妖圣之一的覆海大圣坐镇，也需要我这一介外人？道友若不如实到来，恕我不能答应。¤The dragon tribe is the hegemon of the sea, and there is one of the four demon saints, the great saint of the sea, also need me, an outsider? If you do not come truthfully, forgive me for not being able to agree.
既然如此，敖灵也不便勉强，这就送道友出去。¤That being the case, Ao Ling couldn't be reluctant, so he sent fellow Daoists out.
海上霸主？我龙族经历上古鲲龙之战早已不复从前，连龙宫都已经丢了，父亲也在闭死关欲突破化神不理外务，东海近来又有异动，浪方那老妖怪也不安分，此时正值多事之秋，正需要道友这样的修为精深之人，你若是还有顾虑但问无妨。¤Overlord of the sea? My dragon clan experienced the ancient Kunlong battle long gone, even the Dragon Palace has been lost, my father is also in seclusion trying to break through to Deity Transformation and ignore foreign affairs. It's an eventful time, and you need someone with profound cultivation like your fellow Daoist. If you still have concerns, it's okay to ask.
对方面露苦涩。¤The other side showed bitterness.
上古时期，我龙族本是居于东海，筑有龙宫，天下鳞甲来朝。不过鲲族狼子野心、冒然来袭，此战撼天动地上古龙宫更是被击沉于海底。最终我龙族虽惨胜，却也不得不退居于化龙海。¤In ancient times, my dragon family originally lived in the East China Sea, built a dragon palace, and the world came to court with scales. However, the Kun clan's wolf son's ambition and rash attack, this battle shook the earth and the Ancient Dragon Palace was sunk to the bottom of the sea. In the end, although my dragon race won a tragic victory, it had to retreat to the sea of ​​dragons.
浪方海鲲族，乃是上古鲲鹏后裔，本与我龙族相安无事，但不知道从何处得到了一门邪法《吞龙决》，引动上古鲲鹏血脉吞噬龙族以精进修为。¤The Langfang Haikun clan are descendants of the ancient Kunpeng. They were at peace with our dragon clan, but they got an evil method Dragon Swallowing Art from somewhere, which motivated the ancient Kunpeng blood to devour the dragon clan to improve their cultivation.
道友，有所不知，覆海大圣正是家父。¤Fellow Daoist, I don't know, the Great Sage Fuhai is my father.
上古龙宫虽是沉没于海底，但近来偶有碎片浮于海面之上，我族派人调查但其中甚是凶险，甚至有元婴期长老陨落其中。¤Although the Ancient Dragon Palace sank on the bottom of the sea, there are occasionally fragments floating on the sea surface recently. Our clan sent people to investigate, but it is very dangerous, and even the elders of the Yuan Ying period fell into it.
唉....实不相瞒，陨落其中的乃是我的兄长敖玄，一身修为元婴巅峰仅次于父亲，兄长最后一点消息乃是告诫龙族，其中尽是龙尸死气切勿靠近。故而我们也不甚了解其中诡谲。¤Sigh.... to tell the truth, it was my elder brother Ao Xuan who fell among them. His cultivation base was second only to his father at the peak of Nascent Soul. The last piece of news from my elder brother was to warn the dragon clan, which are full of dragon corpses, and don't get close to them. . So we don't really understand the weirdness of it.
.......节哀。¤......Condolences.
目前当务之急是前往东海调查那处龙宫碎片，道友可愿成为龙族客卿助我一臂之力？¤The most urgent task at present is to go to the East China Sea to investigate the fragment of the Dragon Palace. Would you like to become a guest of the Dragon Clan and help me?
唉....既然如此，敖灵也不便勉强，这就送道友出去。¤Alas...Since this is the case, Ao Ling can't be reluctant, so he will send fellow Daoists out.
那就多谢道友了，这龙鳞印是我龙族客卿信物，事不宜迟东海之行还望道友速速动身。¤Then I would like to thank Daoist friends. This dragon scale seal is a token of my dragon clan's guest. If it is not too late, I hope that Daoist friends will leave quickly.
敖灵还有一不情之请，道友进入那陨龙之地还请祭起这龙鳞印，感应我兄长...¤Ao Ling still has a ruthless request. Daoist friends enter the land of the falling dragon and please sacrifice this dragon scale seal to sense my brother...
道友，是要我前去收敛令兄的尸身？¤Fellow Daoist, do you want me to go and collect Brother Ling's body?
兄长的命符虽失去感应，但是他一身修为几近化神，就是浪方老贼都不一定能留住他，故而敖灵还有一丝幻想。此事不论成败，我个人都将拿出一枚天道果作为酬劳。¤Although his brother's life talisman lost his senses, his cultivation was almost Deity Transformation, and even the old thief Langfang might not be able to keep him, so Ao Ling still had some illusions. Regardless of success or failure, I will personally take out a Heavenly Dao Fruit as a reward.
我尽力而为。¤I try my best.
还请道友火速行事。¤Also ask fellow Daoists to act quickly.
道友，在龙宫中有何发现？¤Fellow Daoist, what did you find in the Dragon Palace?
刚刚进入龙宫，你就能看到敖玄敖灵兄妹已经在等待你了。¤As soon as you enter the Dragon Palace, you can see that Ao Xuan and Ao Ling are already waiting for you.
敖玄？敖灵？¤Ao Xuan? Ao Ling?
你还未开口，你携带的龙魂石就自己飞了出来。¤Before you even opened your mouth, the dragon soul stone you were carrying flew out by itself.
一股浩瀚的神识扫过这个龙宫。¤A vast divine consciousness swept across the Dragon Palace.
敖玄暗暗将妹妹挡在身后，你能感受到龙宫的大阵开始飞速运转了，数道强横的气息也从各个建筑爆发而出。¤Ao Xuan secretly kept his sister behind him, and you could feel the Dragon Palace's grand formation starting to fly, and several powerful auras erupting from various buildings.
晚辈正是，敢问前辈来我龙族有何指教。¤The junior is exactly, dare to ask the senior to come to my dragon clan for advice.
尔等不必惊慌，本座龙皇九霄。¤You don't have to panic, this Dragon Emperor Jiuxiao.
说罢，一股王者威压席卷了这片空间，你感受到了一种源自血脉的服从。¤After all, a king's coercion swept this space, and you felt a kind of obedience derived from blood.
说罢，一股王者威压席卷了这片空间，对面敖灵、敖玄兄妹似有屈膝的迹象。¤After all, a king's coercion swept this space, and the brothers and sisters Ao Ling and Ao Xuan on the opposite side seemed to show signs of bowing their knees.
不过这威压仅持续一瞬间便收了回去。¤However, this coercion only lasted for a moment and then retracted.
四处遁光四起，皆立于敖玄敖灵兄妹身后，你看到焚天、煮海也在其中。¤There are lights everywhere, all standing behind Ao Xuan and Ao Ling, you can see Fen Tian and Zhu Hai are among them.
拜见老祖！！¤I pay my respects to the venerable Ancestor! !
此番多亏了小友，我才得以脱困。¤Thanks to my little friend, I was able to get out of trouble this time.
你们父亲在哪里？叫他来见我。¤Where is your father? Call him to see me.
敖玄面露难色。¤Ao Xuan's face was embarrassed.
父亲他前几日尝试化神失败，修为大退目前正在闭死关疗伤。¤Father, he failed in his attempt to reach Deity Transformation a few days ago, and he is currently in retreat to heal his injuries.
唉...我先于龙墓温养神魂，等他出关命他来见我！¤Alas... I will warm up my soul before the dragon tomb, and wait for him to come out and order him to see me!
说罢龙魂石直飞龙墓。¤After all, the Dragon Soul Stone flew directly to the Dragon Tomb.
恭送老祖！！¤Congratulations to the grandfather! !
{FirstName}道友，究竟是何情况？¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, what is the situation?
你将上古龙宫之中的情况告诉他。¤You tell him the situation in the Ancient Dragon Palace.
原来如此，此番凶险，道友护送老祖归来，多谢道友了！¤It turned out to be the case, this time is dangerous, fellow Daoist escorted the ancestors back, thank you fellow Daoist!
说罢敖玄拱手作揖。¤After speaking, Ao Xuan bowed his hands.
族内事务繁重我先走一步，道友若是有事可来皇龙殿找我。¤The affairs of the clan are heavy, so I will go first. If you have something to do, you can come to the Emperor Dragon Hall to find me.
我也在替我父亲搜寻化神所用的丹药，虽然丹灵果我现下没有，但这龙血草乃是替代之物此番就赠与道友了。¤I am also searching for the Deity Transformation Pill for my father. Although I don't have the Pill, the dragon's blood grass is a substitute and I will give it to fellow Taoists.
近些年我龙族式微，鲲族在此獠的带领下不断滋扰我族，道友此举当是为我族除去一心腹大患。¤In recent years, my dragon clan has been declining, and the Kun clan has been harassing my clan under the leadership of this clan.
此时你收到一道神识传音。¤At this time, you received a divine voice transmission.
言毕，焚天长老上前一步。¤After speaking, Elder Fen Tian took a step forward.
还请前辈指点。\n¤Also ask seniors for advice. \n
小友战力惊天竟能越级击杀化神妖圣，看来蜕凡成仙只日可见。¤The little friend's combat power is astonishing, and he can leapfrog the level to kill the demon saint. It seems that the Deity Transformation is only visible every day.
多谢敖灵道友，谬赞了。¤Many thanks to fellow Daoist Ao Ling, it's a compliment.
{FirstName}道友，不知能否移步大殿，敖玄有事相商。¤{FirstName}Daoist friends, I wonder if you can move to the main hall, Ao Xuan has something to discuss.
道友，在浪方海域击杀那鲲族余孽的事已然传遍各方威震四海了。¤Fellow Daoist, the killing of the remnant of the Kun clan in the Langfang sea area has already spread all over the world.
道友，这冰心寒玉、仙淼铜是我龙宫珍藏的六品炼器材料，这就赠与道友。¤Daoist friend, this Bing Xinhan Jade and Xianmiao Bronze are the materials of the sixth-grade refining equipment collected by my Dragon Palace, so they are given to Daoist friends.
此番大恩，我龙族上下必会铭记，若有需要我龙族必不推辞。¤This great kindness will definitely be remembered by my dragon clan, and my dragon clan will not refuse if necessary.
{FirstName}道友，小女子敖灵，目前暂代族长之位。。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, the little girl Ao Ling, currently serves as the temporary patriarch. .
不过，化神与其他境界之间堪称仙凡之别，这蜕凡成仙不知多少天骄被阻于此。¤However, the difference between the Deity Transformation and other realms can be called the difference between the immortals and the immortals. I don't know how many arrogances have been blocked here.
刚刚进入龙宫，你就发现一团魂火浮于空中。¤As soon as you entered the Dragon Palace, you found a mass of soul fire floating in the air.
不过小友你于我龙族有大恩，你且随我来。¤But little friend, you have a great favor to my dragon clan, so come with me.
确实并非亲眼所见，乃是我族中长老前去查探时感应到了道友独有的龙鳞印上的气息罢了¤It's not what I saw with my own eyes, but when the elders of our clan went to investigate, they sensed the aura on the unique dragon scale seal of fellow Daoists.
道友，那鲲族余孽与人交手后落败身死。不知是否是道友所为？¤Fellow Daoist, the remnant of the Kun tribe was defeated and died after fighting with others. I don't know if it's the work of a buddy?
小友，观你气息已是元婴后期，看来蜕凡成仙只日可见。¤Little friend, looking at your breath, you are in the late stage of Nascent Soul, it seems that you can only see the transformation into an immortal.
不过小友你于我龙族有大恩，当你突破至元婴后期乃至化神期便可来龙墓寻我。¤However, you have been a great benefactor to my dragon clan. When you break through to the late YuanYing stage or even the Deity Transformation stage, you can come to the Dragon Tomb to find me.
抵达海底龙宫，你看到远处一个女子正在等你。¤When you arrive at the Underwater Dragon Palace, you see a woman waiting for you in the distance.
刚刚进入龙宫，你就发现一团魂火浮于空中，敖灵、敖玄等人皆立于广场之上迎接你。¤As soon as you entered the Dragon Palace, you found a mass of soul fire floating in the air, and Ao Ling, Ao Xuan and others stood on the square to greet you.
不过，元婴化神之间堪称仙凡之别，这蜕凡成仙不知多少天骄被阻于此。¤However, the difference between Nascent Soul and Deity Transformation can be called the difference between immortals and mortals. I don't know how many arrogances have been blocked from this transformation into immortals.
确实并非亲眼所见，乃是我族中长老前去查探时感应到了道友独有的龙鳞印上的气息罢了。¤It's not what I saw with my own eyes, but when the elders of our clan went to investigate, they sensed the aura on the dragon scale seal unique to Daoist friends.
称不上指点，不过是一点小帮助罢了。龙墓乃是我龙族禁地，莫说外人就是焚天煮海他们也没有资格进入。¤Not a guide, but a little help. The Dragon Tomb is a forbidden place for my Dragon Clan, not to mention outsiders are not qualified to enter.
浪方海域¤wave side sea
道友威名赫赫，敖灵早有耳闻，今日得见果然名不虚传。¤Ao Ling has heard a lot about your reputation, and today I have seen it.
对方看着你欲言又止...¤The other side looked at you and wanted to say something...
此番百里家归还龙珠，阁下也是出力甚多，我在此谢过道友了。这两颗龙皇果还望道友收下。¤This time the Baili family returned the dragon pearl, you also contributed a lot, I would like to thank you here. I hope that you will accept these two Dragon Emperor Fruits.
正是。不过我速速离去应是无人发现吧？¤Exactly. But if I leave quickly, no one will notice, right?
你且随我来。¤You will come with me.
刚刚进入龙宫，敖灵、敖玄等人皆立于广场之上迎接你。¤Just after entering the Dragon Palace, Ao Ling, Ao Xuan and others stood on the square to greet you.
刚刚进入龙宫，敖灵等人皆立于广场之上迎接你。¤Just entered the Dragon Palace, Ao Ling and others are standing on the square to greet you.
小友，观你气息已是化神强者，当日见你便觉得根骨惊奇他日必成就不低，没曾想这短短百年便已成化神强者。¤Little friend, I saw that you are already a strong Deity Transformation cultivator. When I saw you that day, I thought that you had amazing bones and that you would be a great success in the future.
你说的可是此物？¤Is this what you said?
引雷柱？¤Lightning pole?
我会留意的。¤I'll keep an eye out.
道友，雷狱阵需要成为我族供奉才能进入。¤Fellow Daoist, the Thunder Prison Array needs to be a Guest Elder in our clan to enter.
只见他手掐数道法诀，随着引雷柱的补全阵法开始运转。¤He could only see his hand choke several spells, and as the lightning-attracting pillar was replenished the formation began to operate.
道友，雷狱阵乃是我龙族自上古传下来的引雷锻体之法。¤Fellow Daoist, the Thunder Prison Array is the method of attracting thunder and forging the body handed down from ancient times by my dragon clan.
不过，目前阵基缺失已经不能运转了。¤However, the current lack of formation base has been unable to operate.
九霄雷狱阵的阵基名唤{color=#d0380a}“引雷柱”{/color}，它的炼制手法自上古之后就已经遗失了。¤The base of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison Array is called {color=#d0380a}“Thundering Pillar”{/color}, and its refining method has been lost since ancient times.
不过，上古龙宫沉于{color=#d0380a}东海{/color}之下，传闻有人在东海的龙宫遗迹之中寻到过此物。¤However, the Ancient Dragon Palace sank under the {color=#d0380a}East Sea{/color}, and it is rumored that someone has found this object in the remains of the Dragon Palace in the East China Sea.
多谢道友为我龙宫重建雷狱阵。¤Thank you, Fellow Daoist, for rebuilding the Thunder Prison Formation for my Dragon Palace.
道友，可愿意帮助我龙宫修复雷狱阵？¤Fellow Daoist, are you willing to help my Dragon Palace repair the Thunder Prison Array?
多谢道友相助，不过这雷狱阵还需要2根引雷柱才能完全恢复。¤Many thanks to fellow Daoists for your help, but this Thunder Prison Array still needs 2 Lightning Pillars to fully recover.
修复雷狱阵需要3根引雷柱，目前已经收集到{$TempValue}根了。¤It takes 3 lightning rods to repair the Thunder Prison Array, and {$TempValue} has been collected so far.
多谢道友相助。¤Thank you for your help.
我这就开始着手修复阵法。¤I started to repair the array.
介时由我为道友主持阵法，道友入阵引雷锻体。¤I will preside over the formation for you, and you will enter the formation to induce lightning to forge your body.
道友可知这引雷锻体的过程是什么样的？我入阵又需要什么准备？¤Do you know what the process of attracting lightning to forge the body is like? What preparation do I need to enter the formation?
据记载入阵者体道须有融会贯通的境界，如若不然可能会有危险。¤According to the records, those who enter the formation must be able to integrate their body dao, otherwise they may be in danger.
雷鸣海每隔数百年都会有天地异象九霄雷狱降世，据先祖记载其中雷电乃是先天之雷若能抗住雷劫并且吸收对锻体大有裨益。¤According to our ancestors, the thunderbolts are the lightning of the Heaven and Earth. If you can resist the thunderbolts and absorb them, it will be beneficial to your body.
雷狱阵乃是我族前辈九玄大圣，根据雷鸣海九霄雷狱所创，用以引雷锻体。¤The Thunder Prison Formation was created by my clan's predecessor, the Great Sage Jiu Xuan, based on the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison of the Thundering Sea, to induce thunder to forge the body.
以我的体道修为还是不要冒险了。¤With my Body Dao cultivation it is better not to take any chances.
道友，何事？¤Friends, what's the matter?
我该如何进入雷鸣海九霄雷狱呢？¤How do I enter the Thundering Sea Nine Heavens Thunder Prison?
但在九霄雷狱中吸收先天灵气需要锻体秘术，先祖九玄有记载其中几门吸收先天神雷的秘术，不过其中多是为我龙族量身定制的应该没有适合道友的。¤But absorbing the innate spiritual energy in the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison requires body forging secret arts. Our ancestor Jiu Xuan has recorded several of these secret arts for absorbing the innate divine lightning, but most of them are tailor-made for my dragon tribe there should be nothing suitable for you.
九霄神雷乃是先天之雷，在其中引雷锻体，可以吸收先天之气精进体道。道友进入其中不断承受雷劫就可吸收先天灵气。¤The Divine Thunder of the Nine Heavens is the lightning of the innate heavens, and by drawing lightning into it to forge your body, you can absorb the innate energy to refine your body dao. If you enter it, you will be able to absorb the innate spiritual energy.
那雷鸣海引雷锻体又该如何完成？¤And how should the Thundering Sea induce thunder to forge the body?
九霄雷狱本就是一处存在于异空间的天地异象，而链接它的空间节点是不断变动的，想要进入必须找到空间节点。¤The Nine Heavens Thunder Prison is a heaven and earth phenomenon that exists in a different space, and the spatial nodes linking it are constantly changing, so you must find the spatial nodes to enter.
说罢他递给你一块玉简，你将神识探入其中。¤Saying this he hands you a jade slip and you probe your soul sense into it.
对了，我想起了有一门应该适合道友。¤By the way, I have remembered one discipline that should suit the Taoist.
关于雷鸣海我就知道这么多了。¤That's all I know about the Thundering Sea.
哦，对了先祖曾在笔录中记载，在渡过了锻体之后，还陷入了顿悟之中，领悟了一道渡劫仙术，只是可惜...¤Oh yes, the ancestor had recorded in his handwriting that after crossing the forged body, he also fell into an epiphany and comprehended a transmigration immortal technique, but unfortunately...
多谢告知。¤Thanks for the information.
一道光幕挡住了你。¤A curtain of light blocks you.
道友，你这次的仪式就我亲自主持。¤Fellow Daoist, I personally preside over your ceremony this time.
一道光幕挡住了你，远远望去一颗龙珠浮于空中。¤A light curtain blocks you, and you can see a dragon ball floating in the air from a distance.
道友，这进入龙脉之中的化龙池，必须你成为供奉之后。¤Fellow Daoist, after entering the Dragon Transformation Pond in the dragon veins, you must become a Guest Elder.
道友，我龙族龙珠为百里败类所盗取，现在这龙脉之中的化龙池不过是徒有其表罢了。¤Fellow Daoist, my dragon balls were stolen by Baili scum, and now the Dragon Transformation Pond in this dragon vein is nothing more than an appearance.
道友，可是要进入化龙池？¤Fellow Daoist, but you want to enter the Dragon Transformation Pond?
道友，若是准备好了，随时可以来找我。¤Fellow Daoist, if you are ready, you can come to me at any time.
小友，来此可有要事？¤Little friend, is there something important to come here?
一道光幕阻挡住了你，九霄并没有回应你。¤A curtain of light blocks you, and the ninth heaven does not respond to you.
浪方体内灵气充裕，灵力屏障的恢复速度极快。要尝试现在就攻击肉壁逃离这里么？¤Lang Fang has abundant spiritual energy in his body, and the recovery speed of the spiritual barrier is extremely fast. Do you want to try to escape from here by attacking the meat wall now?
已经修炼了{$year}年，但浪方体内的灵气仍然十分充裕，灵力屏障的恢复速度极快。要尝试现在就攻击肉壁逃离这里么？¤He has been cultivating for {$year} years, but the spiritual energy in Lang Fang's body is still very abundant, and the recovery speed of the spiritual energy barrier is extremely fast. Do you want to try to escape from here by attacking the meat wall now?
修炼了{$year}年，浪方体内的灵气已经稀释了不少，要尝试现在就攻击肉壁逃离这里么？¤After cultivating for {$year} years, the aura in Lang Fang's body has been diluted a lot. Do you want to try to attack the flesh wall to escape from here?
修炼了{$year}年，浪方体内的灵气已经大不如前，要尝试现在就攻击肉壁逃离这里么？¤After cultivating for {$year} years, the spiritual energy in Lang Fang's body is not as good as before. Do you want to try to attack the flesh wall and escape from here?
你在他的体内修炼，无异于是在与他争夺灵气，间接也削弱了他的实力。到时候再想办法动手，应该比现在要容易的多。¤When you cultivate in his body, it is tantamount to competing with him for spiritual energy, which indirectly weakens his strength. When the time comes, it should be much easier than it is now.
浪方每次施展吞噬神通后，都需要花费大量的时间才能将这些灵气全部炼化吸收。¤Every time Lang Fang used the Devouring Magical Power, it took a lot of time to refine and absorb all these spiritual qi.
这些肉壁都有灵气屏障的保护，而且屏障恢复的速度奇快，想要打穿肉壁从这里逃出去，恐怕没有那么简单。¤These flesh walls are protected by aura barriers, and the barrier recovery speed is extremely fast. I am afraid it is not that simple to break through the flesh walls and escape from here.
若是施展领域神通，未必不能破除这里的云雾。要为此强行开启领域么...？¤If you use domain supernatural powers, you may not be able to break the clouds here. Do you want to forcibly open the realm for this...?
就这样过了一两个时辰，你实在是讲无可讲，一时间不知道说些什么，愣在了原地。¤After an hour or two like this, you really have nothing to say, you don't know what to say for a while, and you are stunned in place.
传言吞云大圣修为通天，不过依我看……也不过尔尔。¤It is rumored that the Great Sage Swallowing the Clouds cultivated to reach the sky, but in my opinion...it's not that much.
说罢，你身前的云雾分出了一条小道，吞云大圣也消失在了云雾中。你凭空作了一揖，便离开了此地。¤After all, the cloud and mist in front of you split a path, and the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud also disappeared into the cloud and mist. You bowed out of thin air and left the place.
好强的神识修为...难怪能够看破本座的幻雾。¤Such a strong spiritual cultivation base... No wonder he was able to see through the phantom fog of this seat.
（此人莫非...便是吞云大圣？）¤(Could this person be... the Great Sage Swallowing Clouds?)
正是，不过他并非宁州之人，而是从雍州而来……¤Exactly, but he is not from Ning Province, but from Yong Province...
有意思，短短不到十日的时间，便能看破本座的云雾幻象...¤Interesting, in less than ten days, you can see through the cloud illusion of this seat...
哈哈哈哈哈，口出狂言。那就让本座看看你有几分能耐！¤Hahahahaha, ranting. Then let this seat see how capable you are!
在下乃是龙族供奉，还望看在龙族的份上，给在下几分薄面……¤I'm a Guest Elder of the dragon clan, and for the sake of the dragon clan, please reconsider it.
不行，这云雾法门相当高明，仅凭我目前对于水道的感悟，还不足以破开它...得想想别的办法。¤No, this cloud and mist method is quite clever, and just based on my current understanding of the waterway, it is not enough to break it... I have to think of other ways.
你尝试操控周天的云雾，云雾开始慢慢翻滚着向两旁褪去，远处一名身着青衣的白发男子若隐若现，似乎正在打量着你...¤You try to control the clouds and mists around the sky, and the clouds and mists begin to slowly roll and fade to both sides. In the distance, a white-haired man in blue clothes is looming, and he seems to be looking at you...
有趣...你的眼睛很独特，竟能看破本座的幻雾。¤Interesting... Your eyes are so unique that you can see through the phantom fog of this seat.
无奈之下，你只得向他求饶。¤In desperation, you had to beg him for mercy.
你将灵气灌入双目之中，但目力所及皆是白茫茫的一片，最多不过看到数百米开外的地方。¤You poured spiritual energy into your eyes, but as far as your eyes could see, it was a vast expanse of white, and at most you could only see a few hundred meters away.
笑话，本座要人类的灵石有何用？¤Just a joke, what's the use of this man's spiritual stone?
你将神识展开，向周围探去。但这里的云雾有一定阻挡神识的效果。反复尝试了多次以后，你还是没能找到正确的方向。¤You spread out your consciousness and probed around. But the clouds and mists here have the effect of blocking the consciousness. After trying many times, you still can't find the right direction.
笑话，就算是覆海大圣亲至本座也不一定给他面子。¤It's a joke, even if the great saint of Fuhai comes to this seat, it doesn't necessarily give him face.
雾气渐浓，一开始你只觉得这在吞云海上是正常现象，但没过多久，四周就变成了白茫茫的一片，一时间竟让你分不清方向。¤The fog is getting thicker. At first, you only think that this is a normal phenomenon in the sea of ​​swallowing clouds, but it didn't take long for the surrounding to become a white piece, and for a while, you couldn't tell the direction.
这浓雾非同寻常，竟然还能阻挡我的神识...在这吞云海上有能力施展此等神通的，恐怕...¤This thick fog is unusual, and it can even block my soul sense... I am afraid that someone who has the ability to use such magical powers in this sea of ​​swallowing clouds...
传言吞云大圣修为通天，在下特来讨教，还望大圣指点一二。¤It is rumored that the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud has cultivated into the sky, and I am here to ask for advice. I also hope that the Great Sage will give some pointers.
你施展领域，全力一击下，雾气轰然散开，远处一名身着青衣的白发男子若隐若现，似乎正在打量着你。¤You cast the domain, and with a full blow, the mist dissipated, and a white-haired man dressed in azure loomed in the distance, as if he was looking at you.
道友与我修为相当，又何须用指点二字。本座也许久未与同阶修士切磋交流了，今日便与道友过上两招罢。¤Fellow Daoist and I have the same cultivation level, so why use the word pointing? Maybe it’s been a long time since I have exchanged ideas with fellow Daoists, so I’ll have two moves with fellow Daoists today.
看来还得想想别的办法...¤Looks like I have to think of another way...
罢了，下次来你若能通过本座的考验，本座倒不是不能指点你一二。¤That's all, if you can pass the test of this seat next time, it's not that this seat can't give you some pointers.
恐怕只有化神期妖圣，吞云大圣吧。¤I am afraid that there is only the demon saint in the Deity Transformation stage, the great saint swallowing clouds.
原来如此...虽然变化更加复杂，但与我所学的幻雾法门还是有许多相似之处。用操控幻雾的手法，应当可以破除这里的云雾。¤That's it...Although the changes are more complicated, there are still many similarities with the magic mist method I have learned. Using the method of manipulating the phantom fog, it should be able to break the cloud and fog here.
前辈息怒，其实在下来自宁州，还与化神期强者白帝颇有渊源，望前辈给两分薄面...放过离开。¤Senior calm down his anger, in fact, he is from Ning Province, and he has a lot of ties to the Deity Transformation stage powerhouse Bai Di, I hope senior will give you two points of thin noodles... let it go.
哈哈哈，小友既能破了我的幻雾境，也算是与本座有缘，今日便与小友过上两招罢。¤Hahaha, my little friend can break through my phantom fog, and it can be considered a relationship with this seat, so I will have two moves with my little friend today.
前辈息怒，其实在下来自宁州{$menpaistr}，还望前辈给两分薄面……¤Senior calm down his anger, in fact, he is from Ning Province{$menpaistr}, and I hope that senior will give two points of thin noodles...
呵呵呵，听来人类的世界倒也颇为有趣，只可惜小友实力稍欠火候。¤Hehehe, it sounds like the human world is quite interesting, but it's a pity that the little friend's strength is a little underwhelming.
你全力施展神通，连续不断的向着同一处攻去。也不知过了多久，雾气渐渐淡了，远处一名身着青衣的白发男子若隐若现，似乎正在打量着你。¤You use your full power to attack the same place continuously. I don't know how long it took, the fog gradually faded away, and a white-haired man in a green robe loomed in the distance, and seemed to be looking at you.
原来如此...云雾虽然变换莫测，但终究不过是对于水之道的一种运用方式。凭我对于水之道的感悟，应当可以破除这里的云雾。¤So it turns out... Clouds and mists change unpredictably, but after all, they are just a way of using the way of water. Based on my understanding of the way of water, it should be able to break the clouds and mists here.
看来不破除这片幻雾，是没有办法从这里离开了。得想想办法...¤It seems that there is no way to leave from here without breaking this phantom fog. Gotta figure out a way...
哦？本座为何要放过你？¤Oh? Why should I let you go?
你盘腿坐下，细细感悟云雾的流动...¤You sit cross-legged and feel the flow of clouds and mists...
你收敛起气息，过了一会，云雾不但没有散去，反而更重了。¤You restrained your breath, and after a while, the cloud and mist not only did not dissipate, but instead became heavier.
只见周围的雾气淡了下来，不远处隐约出现了一名身着青衣的白发男子。¤I saw the surrounding fog lighten down, and a white-haired man in blue clothes loomed not far away.
你施展神通，向四周的浓雾中猛然攻去。雾气一阵翻滚后又恢复了平静，似乎什么事也没有发生...¤You cast your magical powers and slammed into the thick fog around you. After the fog rolled for a while, it returned to calm, as if nothing had happened...
云层之后，一名身着青衣的白发男子，竟也在打量着你。¤Behind the clouds, a white-haired man in Tsing Yi was looking at you.
这么说，这血河老祖也是化神修为？¤So, Patriarch Blood River is also a Deity Transformation cultivator?
白帝乃是白帝楼楼主，宁州第一剑修，凭一己之力便击退了那血剑宫的血河老祖，其创下的天地人剑，堪称一绝……¤Baidi is the owner of Baidi Building, the number one sword cultivator in Ning Province, and he defeated the Patriarch Blood River of the Blood Sword Palace by himself.
噢？这白帝是何许人也？¤Oh? Who is this White Emperor?
噢？这{$menpaistr}是什么？¤Oh? What is this {$menpaistr}?
你天生异瞳，目力便异于常人。将灵气灌入双目之中，隐隐约约便看见前方站着一名身着青衣的白发男子，竟也在打量着你。¤You are born with different eyes, and your eyesight is different from that of ordinary people. I poured spiritual energy into my eyes, and I vaguely saw a white-haired man in a blue shirt standing in front of me, who was looking at you.
我要给前辈多少灵石，前辈才肯放过我？前辈不妨直说便是。¤How many spirit stones do I have to give to senior before senior is willing to let me go? Seniors may wish to say it directly.
若是施展神通连续攻击，未必不能破除这里的云雾，但恐怕对灵力损耗颇大...要强行破除这里的幻雾么？¤If you use magical powers to continuously attack, you may not be able to break the clouds here, but I am afraid that the loss of spiritual power will be quite large... Do you want to forcibly break the magic fog here?
这里的云雾虽然有一定阻挡神识的效果，但你将神识凝于一点，穿透力便大大的增强了。反复试探之下，终于穿透了厚厚的云层。¤Although the clouds and mists here have the effect of blocking the consciousness to a certain extent, if you condense the consciousness at one point, the penetration power will be greatly enhanced. After repeated attempts, he finally penetrated the thick clouds.
这...门派其实是人类特有的称谓，每个门派都有其独特的功法传承，自成一方势力，这{$menpaistr}便是在下师承的门派……¤This... sect is actually a unique title for human beings. Each sect has its own unique inheritance of exercises, and it is a force of its own. This {$menpaistr} is the sect under the apprentice...
按照这个思路，你讲完传说后，便又开始讲一些关于化神强者的传闻，或是一些捕风捉影的故事。吞云大圣同样听的津津有味。¤According to this line of thinking, after you have finished telling the legend, you will start to tell some rumors about the Deity Transformation, or some stories about catching the wind. The Great Sage Swallowing Cloud also listened with gusto.
（这吞云大圣虽然修为高深，但似乎对人类世界很是陌生，连一些基础的概念都不知道...）¤(Although this Cloud Swallowing Sage has a high level of cultivation, he seems to be very unfamiliar with the human world, and he doesn't even know some basic concepts...)
你讲了一些宁州广为流传的精彩传说，每当讲的告一段落，吞云大圣便简单地问两个问题，你便又同他解释。¤You talked about some wonderful legends that were widely circulated in Ning Province. Whenever the story came to an end, the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud simply asked two questions, and you explained it to him again.
前辈，在下无意打扰前辈静修，只是无意间飞入此处，还望前辈恕罪。¤Senior, I didn't intend to disturb the senior's retreat, but just flew into this place unintentionally, and hoped that the senior would forgive me.
嗯，走吧。¤Well, let's go.
快走啦，这里我都清理干净了，没什么好看的。¤Let's go, I've cleaned up here, there's nothing to look at.
你又在附近搜索了一番，果然没有更多收获。若不是一股淡淡的血腥味萦绕不散，你甚至会怀疑这附近并不是战场。¤You searched the neighborhood again, and sure enough, nothing more. If it weren't for a faint smell of blood lingering, you would even suspect that the vicinity was not a battlefield.
（这...不论是屋内还是屋外，竟然都没有战斗的痕迹...）¤(This...whether inside or outside the house, there is no sign of fighting...)
你向星铃儿点点头，而后又示意自己想在附近看看。¤You nodded to Xing Linger, and then signaled that you wanted to take a look nearby.
这边的修士都被我解决啦，比想象中的要简单一点，嘻嘻。¤The cultivators here are all solved by me, it's a little simpler than I thought, hee hee.
而星铃儿正坐在灵田边的凉亭内哼小曲。¤And Xing Linger was sitting in the pavilion beside Lingtian humming a little song.
屋前还有几片贫瘠的灵田，其中草药都还没生长完成，并无价值。¤There are still several barren spiritual fields in front of the house, in which the herbs have not yet grown and are worthless.
一排简单的房屋排列在你眼前，简易程度让人觉得不过是临时居住所用。¤A row of simple houses lined up in front of you, the simplicity of which makes it feel like nothing more than temporary housing.
另一边有些我在意的气息，还是待会再来此处吧。¤On the other side, there are some breaths that I care about, so I'll come back here later.
你正为星铃儿强大的实力惊叹时，却看见还有另一位修士正潜伏在大殿的阴影中准备出手袭击她，后者却像是被其他物事吸引了注意力一般，毫无防备。¤When you were amazed by Xing Ling'er's powerful strength, you saw another cultivator lurking in the shadow of the main hall, ready to attack her, but the latter seemed to be attracted by other things and was defenseless.
星道友小心！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Fellow Daoist Star should be more careful! {vpunch=10,0.5}
但预想之中的攻击并没有到来，甚至呼喝也戛然而止，只有四处逸散的红白之物沾染了你方才凝集的灵气护盾。定睛看去，此些污物的主人已是瘫倒在星铃儿身前。¤But the expected attack did not come, and even the shouting stopped abruptly. Only the red and white things that escaped everywhere stained the aura shield that you just condensed. Looking closely, the owner of these filth has collapsed in front of Xing Ling'er.
刚步入大厅你便听到其中妖人在大声呼喝，立时凝气护体，准备应对。¤As soon as you entered the hall, you heard the demons shouting loudly, and immediately condensed the air to protect the body, ready to deal with it.
此乃禁地锁鸾堂！何人擅...¤This is a forbidden place to lock Luan Hall! Who is good at...
由于不知这里是否有妖人埋伏，你不愿让星铃儿独自赴险，只得跟上去。¤Since you don't know if there are monsters in ambush here, you don't want to let Xing Ling'er go to danger alone, so you have to follow.
一座破败的建筑横卧在此地，其点缀着绿意的门墙上不断渗出压抑的痛哼和幽暗的呻吟。¤A dilapidated building lay on the ground, its green-dotted door walls oozing repressed groans and dark moans.
你虽不知这是何处，但星铃儿显然已经知道屋内有些什么。于是你还在犹豫时，她已皱着眉头，一言不发地步入其中。¤Although you don't know where this is, Xing Ling'er obviously already knows what's in the house. So while you were still hesitating, she frowned and stepped into it without saying a word.
这边是教众的居所，还是交给我吧，解决教主之后你再来帮忙也不迟。¤This is the residence of the congregation, so leave it to me. It's not too late for you to help after the leader is resolved.
哼，多说无益。威不威风还是先问过我的神通再说吧，看招！¤Hmm, it's useless to talk too much. Prestige or not, let's ask my supernatural ability first, let's see!
道友好威风，不过{$JinJie1}修为就弄了个教主当，竟还妄称本座。¤The Taoist is friendly and majestic, but {$JinJie1} has become a leader because of his cultivation, and he even pretends to be the seat.
大胆狂徒！竟敢在本座面前出言不逊！¤Daring fanatic! How dare you speak rudely in front of this seat!
你若交出采补秘术，我就是来讨教的道友，不然嘛，就是取你命的人。¤If you hand over the secret technique of harvesting and replenishing, I will be the Taoist friend who came to ask for advice, otherwise, I will be the one who took your life.
何人打扰本座清修？¤Who is disturbing the cleaning of this building?
一座平平无奇的大殿立于道路尽头，其中一位修士正背对大门盘膝而坐。¤An unremarkable hall stood at the end of the road, one of the cultivators with his back facing the gate was sitting there.
相比之前那处，这里才是不正常。走吧，该去找正主了。¤Compared to the previous place, this place is abnormal. Let's go, it's time to find the real master.
去其他地方看看吧,这里没什么。¤Look elsewhere, nothing here.
这里看起来还挺正常的，好像还有专人清理打扫，不但用具摆放整齐，而且鲜有尘杂。¤It seems quite normal here, it seems that there are special people to clean up, not only the utensils are neatly arranged, but also there is little dust.
但并未有修士驻守在此地，甚至除洞府内常见的用具外别无他物，硬要说的话，也就还有夹杂着各种异香的灵气和某些难以描述的异味罢了。¤But there are no cultivators stationed here, and there is even nothing other than the common utensils in the cave. If you insist, there are auras mixed with various strange fragrances and some indescribable odors.
星铃儿说着，已是漫不经心地轻踩莲步走入其中。你摇摇头，保持警惕地跟随在后。¤Xing Ling'er said, she stepped lightly on the lotus and walked into it casually. You shook your head and followed vigilantly.
还是先进去看看再说吧。¤Let's go ahead and take a look.
星道友的意思是？¤What do you mean by fellow star?
哼，可没修炼那么简单。¤Hmph, it's not as simple as cultivating.
这里灵气充盈，还有着简单的聚灵阵法加持，莫不是所谓“神教“成员用于修炼的地方？¤There is a lot of spiritual energy here, and there is a simple spirit gathering array blessing. Could it be that the members of the so-called God Sect use it for cultivation?
嗯...¤Ok...
所以甚少有修士愿耗时追查，更不用说像这妮子一般赶尽杀绝。如不是其中有什么恩怨，便是个嫉恶如仇的性子罢。¤Therefore, very few cultivators are willing to take time to investigate, let alone kill them like this girl. If there is no personal grudge between them, it is probably due to her hatred of their actions.
采补秘术么...我印象中的宁州还是有相关功法流传的，不过修这类邪术难成气候，修炼者往往又精于躲藏，像这般自成小门派者更是难究其踪。¤This secret art... In my impression, it's wide spread in Ning Province but it's difficult to cultivate. Practioners are also usually adept as hiding and for small sects like this, it's difficult to find their traces.
老头子，你听说过这什么采补秘术么？¤Old man, have you heard of this secret art of Harvesting and Replenishing?
星铃儿只是点点头，看起来并没有放在心上。¤Xing Ling'er just nodded and didn't seem to care.
星道友多加小心。¤Star Daoist friends be more careful.
不可，我先去困住那些教众，你解决他们的头目后尽快来帮我。这些妖人，今天一个也别想跑！¤No, I'll trap those cultists first, and you will help me as soon as you solve their leader. These monsters, don't even try to run away today!
那我们直取教主？想必教主死后，其他教徒也会作猢狲而散，难成威胁。¤Then we take the sect leader? I believe that after the death of the sect leader, other members will also be scattered as rats, it is difficult to become a threat.
经我神识查探，往左便是教主居所，右方则有若干教众。¤After my spiritual investigation, I found that the leader's residence was on the left, and there were several members of the church on the right.
经过刚才锁鸾堂一事，星铃儿显然是心情有些不佳，于是这筑基初期修士一句话还未说完，便已是丢掉了自己的性命。¤After the incident in the hall, Daoist Star was clearly in a bad mood, the cultivator of the Early Stage Foundation Realm hadn't even finished speaking before losing their life...
站住！我怎么没见过你...¤Stop! Who are you? How come I haven't seen you...
（你快去解决他，我用神识为你掩盖战斗波动，省得引起他人注意。）¤(Take him down quickly, I will stop the battle fluctuations from spreading out with my soul sense so we don't alert the rest of the people in the cave...)
你正考虑着，是该直接动手解决这个自称神教中人的陌生修士，还是先问上两句借此让他放松警惕，免得动静过大，却接到星铃儿的神识传音。¤You are considering whether or not to directly take this cultivator down who claims to be a member of the Ancient God's Cult, or asking a few questions first in order to lower his vigilance... Before you can decide, you receive a sound transmission from Daoist star.
你们是何人？来拜入神教的？难道不知本教只收男弟子么？¤Who are you? Did you come to join the cult? Don't you know we only accept male disciples?
随着通羽上人与林沐心一前一后地离开，星宫这大殿终于又回到静谧之中，仿佛什么都没发生过。¤As Master Tongyu and Lin Muxin left in tandem, the hall of Star Palace finally returned to silence, as if nothing had happened.
回到星宫时，星铃儿正站在星宫大殿上，像是在等你们。¤When returning to the Star Palace, Xing Linger was standing on the Star Palace main hall, as if waiting for you.
再次被通羽上人及林沐心打断后，丹阳子未再说什么，起身拂袖而去。¤After being interrupted again by Master Tongyu and Lin Muxin, Dan Yangzi didn't say anything, got up and walked away.
哼，这老不死的，真烦人。¤Hmph, this immortal, so annoying.
白帝这老家伙是不是知道你和本宫的关系，所以故意让你来邀请我？¤Did this old man, the White Emperor, know about your relationship with this palace and therefore deliberately asked you to invite me?
咳，我还有些事要忙，失陪了。¤Cough, I still have something to do, sorry for that.
那柳红鸾呢？若不是你贪图玩乐，不理事务，她又如何会...¤What about Liu Hongluan? If you didn't want to have fun and ignore business, how could she...
（奇怪，丹阳子为何将{$xing}道友称为宫主？}¤(Strange, why did Danyangzi call fellow Daoist {$xing} the palace master?}
后者接到请帖后用神识漫不经心地扫过，而后便是凡眼可见的，愤怒占据了她的脸庞。¤The latter received the invitation and swept it through with her soul sense in a careless manner, before it was visible to the mortal eye and anger took over her face.
沐心说的宫主便是她，柳红鸾。¤The palace lord Mu Xin said was her, Liu Hongluan.
我...我...我突破化神与他何干！¤I...I...I broke through the Deity Transformation and what did he have to do with him!
{$TmpTalkString}，帮我转告白帝，本宫到时自会前往观礼。¤{$TmpTalkString}, tell the White Emperor for me that my palace will be there to observe the ceremony.
你可还记得约七百年前我带回的那个姓柳的小女孩？¤Do you still remember the little girl named Liu that I brought back about seven hundred years ago?
不知宫主找我与通羽前来何事？为何不见冲虚散人？¤I don't know why the palace master asked me and Tongyu to come here? Why don't you see the Chongxu scattered people?
谨遵宫主命。¤Obey the order of the palace master.
父亲！我也认为通羽长老说的对。¤Father! I also think that Elder Tongyu is right.
但你心知肚明，星宫与古神教之间既已结下仇怨，绝不会就这么轻易结束。¤But you are well aware that since the enmity between the Star Palace and the ancient gods has been forged, it will never end so easily.
星宫大殿之中，星凝正独自于此浏览着什么。¤In the main hall of the Star Palace, Starling is alone here browsing for something.
还能说什么，不就是对我晋升化神而不告抱有不满么。¤What else can I say, isn't it that I am dissatisfied with my promotion to Deity Transformation without suing?
唉...¤Ugh...
我本只想让星宫在宁州平稳发展，但这古神教既是如此嚣张，恐怕星宫的处世方式也得变...¤I just wanted to let Xinggong develop smoothly in Ning Province, but since the ancient gods are so arrogant, I am afraid that Xinggong's way of life will also change...
嗯...可是冲虚散人勾结古神教欲加害宫主，被发现后引柳红鸾、心儿以及{FirstName}道友在追杀时入阵遭伏，从而导致柳红鸾战死？¤Hmm... But Chongxu Sanren colluded with the ancient gods to harm the palace lord. After being discovered, Liu Hongluan, Xin'er and fellow Daoist {FirstName} were caught in the battle and were ambushed, resulting in Liu Hongluan's death?
我与{$Lin}私交甚好，相助也是分内之事，道友不用客气。¤I have a very good personal relationship with {$Lin}, and it is my duty to help, so you are welcome.
嗯？有什么不对么？¤Ok? Is there something wrong?
家主！我以为当务之急还是讨论一番如何对待古神教，不应纠结于此。¤Homeowner! I thought that the most urgent task was to discuss how to deal with the ancient gods, and we should not be entangled in this.
好！{vpunch=10,0.5}好！{vpunch=10,0.5}好！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤good! {vpunch=10,0.5} Good! {vpunch=10,0.5} Good! {vpunch=10,0.5}
听闻丹阳子将星铃儿称作宫主让你有些摸不着头脑，你身旁的通羽上人却是满脸平静，一副理所当然的样子。¤Hearing that Dan Yangzi called Xing Ling'er the palace lord makes you a little confused, but Master Tong Yu beside you has a calm face and a natural look.
哼，上门质问又如何，若不是我今日亲口说出来，以你的修为能看穿不成？还不是被瞒到现在。¤Hmph, what about coming to the door and questioning? If I hadn't said it myself today, would you be able to see through it with your cultivation? It has not been concealed until now.
不错，白帝即将渡劫飞升，特让我来邀请你前往观礼。¤It's true, the White Emperor is about to ascend through the tribulation, and has asked me to invite you to come and observe the ceremony.
白帝既有此心，本宫便奉陪到底，¤If the White Emperor is so inclined, I will be there to the end.
哼，说得轻巧，只怕是瞒了我们不下四百年了吧！{vpunch=10,0.5}此前我就在想，你星凝怎么突然转变了性子竟愿呆在宫中修炼，若不是无惑一直相信你，我早就上门质问了！¤Hmph, it's easy to say, I'm afraid it's been deceived from us for more than 400 years! {vpunch=10,0.5}I was thinking earlier, why did you Xing Ning suddenly change your temper and actually want to stay in the palace to cultivate? If it wasn't for Wuhuo who always believed in you, I would have come to question you long ago!
见星凝一副不耐烦的样子，你也没说什么，只是将请帖从储物袋中取出，并通过以灵气御物将其递送过去。¤Seeing Xingning's impatient look, you don't say anything, just take the invitation out of your storage bag and pass it over by using your aura to control the object.
{vpunch=10,0.5}这些，本宫可还没淡忘！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}This is not lost on me!
两人向你点点头，而后沉默地落座。¤The two nodded to you, then took their seats in silence.
好，通羽长老请便。¤Alright, Elder Tongyu, please.
是很久了。¤It's been a long time.
提到宫主身死一事，林沐心似是又回到了奇门绝魂阵中，连话语都有些颤抖。¤When it came to the death of the palace lord, Lin Muxin seemed to have returned to the Qimen Soulless Formation, and even the words trembled.
哼，还有什么好问的。说吧，星凝，瞒了我们多少年了。¤Hmm, what else to ask. Come on, Xing Ning, how many years have you been hiding from us?
让{FirstName}道友见笑了。¤Let {FirstName}Daoist friend laugh.
（{FirstName}{$NickName},父亲和宫主这是在说什么啊，我怎么有些...不对，我完全没懂。）¤({FirstName}{$NickName}, what are the father and the palace lord talking about, why am I... wrong, I don't understand at all.)
这不是今天的重点，我找你们来是为了讨论星宫的立场。¤This is not the point of the day, I am here to discuss the constellation's position.
武陵城那老头竟让你来递送请帖？也罢，我就收下请帖吧，但观礼就免了，我没兴趣。¤How dare that old man from Wuling City ask you to deliver invitations? I'll accept the invitation, but I'm not interested in watching the ceremony.
胡闹！我本以为只是先祖留下了什么秘法或丹药让你寿元多于寻常修士，结果你却连如此重大的事都瞒着我们么！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Bullshit! I thought it was just some secret method or medicinal pill left by the ancestors to give you more lifespan than ordinary cultivators, but you are hiding such an important matter from us! {vpunch=10,0.5}
宫主，这是怎么回事？¤Palace Master, what's going on?
哼，我是为无惑那废物觉得不值，修真路上有半生都在为星宫操劳，结果到寿尽道殂都不知道宫主早已有化神修为。¤Hmph, I don't think it's worth it because of Wuhuo's trash. I spent half my life working for the Star Palace on the way to self-cultivation. As a result, I didn't know that the Palace Master had already cultivated Deity Transformation at the end of his life.
是啊，我都好久没见过父亲这么生气了。¤Yes, I haven't seen my father so angry in a long time.
你收下星铃儿相赠的物事后，想再客套什么，刚好见到丹阳子，通羽上人从门外走入。¤After you accepted the gift from Xing Linger, you wanted to be more polite, but just when you saw Dan Yangzi, Master Tongyu walked in from the door.
通羽长老，你传令下去，让星宫弟子近期以修炼论道为主，减少外出游历的频率，以防古神教还有后手针对。至于是否要针对这邪教做些行动，等那老不死的消了气再作商议。¤Elder Tongyu, you send the order to let the disciples of the Star Palace focus on cultivating and discussing the Tao in the near future, and reduce the frequency of going out to prevent the ancient gods from being targeted. As for whether to take some action against this cult, we will discuss it after the old man has calmed down.
好，道友慢走，我就不送了。¤Okay, fellow Daoist walk slowly, I won't give it away.
星宫出了如此变故，需要商谈一番应对之策，道友若有兴趣可以留下旁听。¤There is such a change in the star palace, and it is necessary to discuss some countermeasures. If you are interested, you can stay and listen.
但...但宫主此前在与我一同追杀...冲...冲虚散人时，被这叛徒引入古神教的大阵中，身...身死道消了...¤But... but the palace master was chasing... rushing... rushing towards the vacant people with me before, and was introduced into the great formation of the ancient gods by this traitor.
一时间丹阳子与星凝的气势互不相让，大殿内的气氛也是猛地降至冰点，满脸迷茫的林沐心更是识趣地闭上了嘴，转而用神识与你交流。¤For a while, Dan Yangzi and Xing Ning's auras were at odds with each other, and the atmosphere in the hall suddenly dropped to freezing point. Lin Muxin, who was confused, closed his mouth even more wisely, and turned to communicate with you with his soul sense.
好，很好。古神教蛊惑我派长老，还害死鸾儿，本宫可未曾淡忘！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Good, very good. The Ancient Gods sect compelled our elders and killed Luan'er, this palace has not forgotten! {vpunch=10,0.5}
白帝前辈即将渡劫飞升，特让我来邀请你届时前往观礼。¤Senior White Emperor is about to ascend, and has asked me to invite you to come and observe the ceremony at that time.
星铃儿皱了皱眉头，但没有反驳，而是转头向你。¤Xing Linger frowned, but did not refute, but turned to you.
我还是不参与星宫内务了。¤I still don't participate in the internal affairs of the star palace.
这印记...武陵城那老头是不是要飞升了？¤This seal... Is that old man from Wuling City about to soar?
但为何心儿会称柳红鸾为宫主呢？还请宫主告知。¤But why does Xin'er call Liu Hongluan the palace master? Please also inform the palace lord.
待通羽上人应承，星凝也是化作一道流光离开大殿，不知去了何方。¤When Master Tongyu agreed, Xing Ning also turned into a streamer and left the hall, not knowing where to go.
在你刚准备踏入殿中之时，她虽未说什么，但已放下手中的玉简。¤As you are just about to step into the hall, she has put down the jade slip in her hand, although she has not said anything.
你是？宫主的...女儿？¤you are? The...daughter of the palace lord?
待其行至大殿门外，话语才伴随着叹息而至。¤When he walked to the door of the main hall, the words came with a sigh.
丹阳子不知所以然地看向林沐心，显然是不知她在质疑什么。而通羽上人则是向你投来询问的目光，你虽说是对此情形有些想法，但未确定之时也不便开口，只得假装没看到通羽上人的目光，反而是看向星玲儿。¤Dan Yangzi looked at Lin Muxin for some reason, apparently not knowing what she was questioning. And Master Tongyu casts an inquiring look at you. Although you have some thoughts about this situation, it is not convenient to speak when you are not sure. You have to pretend that you don't see Master Tongyu's eyes, but look at Xing Linger.
居于上位的星玲儿并没有回应你的目光，像是在思考着什么，一时间也没有为在座各位解惑的打算。¤Xing Linger, who is in the upper position, did not respond to your gaze, as if she was thinking about something, and she did not plan to answer your questions for a while.
星凝一边说着，一边漫不经心地用神识扫过请柬，而后便惊讶的扬起了眉毛。¤Xing Ning said while absently sweeping the invitation with her soul sense, before raising her eyebrows in surprise.
{size=26}私交...{/size}¤{size=26}Personal...{/size}
自然记得，宫主当时见其可怜传以简单的星宫功法，之后又因其天资聪颖便一直带在身边。只是近四百年来我经常闭关，很少见到她，想来她应该也是差不多吧。¤Naturally, I remember that the palace lord saw that he had passed on a simple star palace exercise, and after that, he always took it with him because of his talent and intelligence. It's just that I have often retreated for the past four hundred years, and I have rarely seen her. I think she should be about the same.
你！¤you!
唉，又不是没见过飞升，还要和一帮老家伙装正经，无聊死了。¤It's not like I've never seen an ascension before, I have to pretend to be serious with a bunch of old guys, it's boring as hell.
随着她的诉说，丹阳子一脸错愕的看向星玲儿，通羽也是满脸凝重。¤Following her remarks, Dan Yangzi looked at Xing Linger in astonishment, and Tong Yu also had a solemn face.
你略一思考后，决定留下旁听。¤After a little thought, you decided to stay as an observer.
通羽上人轻轻叹了口气，而后朗声打断星凝与丹阳子的争吵。¤Master Tong Yu sighed softly, and then interrupted the quarrel between Xing Ning and Dan Yangzi loudly.
哼。¤Humph.
通羽长老等等，我跟你一起去，我可不想现在回林府面对父亲。¤Elder Tongyu wait, I'll go with you, I don't want to go back to Lin Mansion to face my father now.
心儿，通羽，此事便由你们和宫主商议定夺吧，我有些乏了。¤Xin'er, Tongyu, it's up to you and the palace master to discuss this matter, I'm a little tired.
我都好久没见过父亲这么生气了。¤I haven't seen my father so angry in a long time.
很好...古神教蛊惑我星宫长老，令我派名誉扫地，还欲加害于本宫。¤Very well... The Ancient God Sect compelled the elders of my Star Palace, brought our sect into disrepute, and tried to inflict harm on our palace.
道友若有兴趣，星宫双修秘术《神交法》也可借与道友一观。¤If you are interested, you can also borrow the double-cultivation secret technique Divine Intercourse with your fellow daoists.
此丹方所记丹药可在突破至化神期时使用，虽不是星宫独有，但也称得上是稀有之物，希望能为道友往后的修炼之路添上一番助力，炼丹所需八角玄冰草与地心淬灵乳也一并相送。¤The medicinal pills recorded in this pill recipe can be used when breaking through to the stage of Deity Transformation. Although it is not unique to the Star Palace, it can also be called a rare thing. I hope it can add some help to the future cultivation path of Daoist friends. The star anise black ice grass and the earth core quenching milk needed for alchemy are also given.
此次多谢道友相助，不然仅凭林长老前去支援，恐怕也要陨落于魔教手中。¤This time, I would like to thank the Daoist friends for their help. Otherwise, if Elder Lin went to support him, I am afraid that he would also fall into the hands of the demon sect.
此次确实是我疏忽了，也罢，我就好好说明一下吧。¤It is true that I was negligent this time, so let me explain.
父亲？你说她是宫主？但...¤Father? You say she is the palace master? but...
家主，宫主能顺利突破至化神期，于星宫而言当是好事。既可壮大星宫实力，又能稳固我派在修仙界的地位近千年，为何要为好事愠恼呢？¤The Patriarch, the Palace Master can successfully break through to the Deity Transformation Stage, which is a good thing for the Star Palace. It can not only strengthen the strength of the star palace, but also stabilize the position of my faction in the world of immortals for nearly a thousand years.
一股{color=red}神识{/color}从你身上扫过。¤A stream of {color=red}Soul Sense{/color} swept across you.
哈哈哈，终于溜进来了！¤Hahaha, finally sneaked in!
{vpunch=10,0.5}糟糕，被发现了，还是赶紧溜吧！¤{vpunch=10,0.5} Oops, I was found, let's slip away!
道友止步，此处乃竹山宗地界。¤Fellow Daoist, this is the boundary of the Bamboo Mountain Sect.
嗯，我也没发现。还是先进去看看再说吧。¤Well, I didn't find that either. Let's go ahead and take a look.
但附近好像没有神识妖兽的气息。¤But there doesn't seem to be any aura of soul sense monsters nearby.
我之前发现的元婴妖兽就是在附近，这洞窟说不定就是它的巢穴。¤The Nascent Soul monster I discovered before is nearby, and this cave might be its lair.
走吧，这些千年冰心石对我们也没啥用，还是让其他有缘人来取吧。¤Let's go, these thousand-year-old ice heart stones are useless to us, let's let other people get it.
嗯，稀有之物必有伴生，说不定我们挖下去还能发现大量的百年冰心石呢。¤Well, rare things must be accompanied, maybe we can find a large number of century-old ice cores when we dig.
好呀，不过我储物袋放不下了，先放你那吧~¤Okay, but I can't fit my storage bag, so let's put yours first~
那就给你咯。¤Then give it to you.
不对不对，是我先见到的，应该是我的。¤No, no, I saw it first, it should be mine.
见到了就是我的，森蛛腿也是肉嘛。¤If you see it, it's mine, and the spider legs are also meat.
你要这个干嘛？¤What do you want this for?
诶，这是伴生的千年冰心石吧。¤Hey, this is the accompanying Millennium Bingxin Stone.
通道的角落中，一簇晶石正若有似无地闪烁着银白之光，如清秋破晓之时的薄雾，满溢清冷之感。¤In the corner of the passage, a cluster of spar is flickering with a silver-white light, like the mist at the dawn of the clear autumn, full of coldness.
嗯，小心些。¤Well, be careful.
估计就在那妖兽修炼的地方！只要我们取了那万载冰心石，不怕它不现身，嘿嘿。¤It is estimated that it is where the monsters cultivated! As long as we take the ten thousand years of ice heart stone, we are not afraid that it will not show up, hehe.
唔，这个数量的话，附近可能还有万载冰心石，估计...¤Well, with this amount, there may be ten thousand years of ice core stones nearby. It is estimated that...
闻言你走上前去，控制法宝在那簇晶石左近深挖了些，底下果然有更多冰心石，对于这种难得一见的四品矿材来说，甚至算得上条千年冰心石矿脉。¤Hearing that, you stepped forward and dug a little deeper around the cluster of spar for the control magic weapon. There are more ice core stones underneath. For this rare fourth-grade mineral, it can even be regarded as a thousand-year-old ice core stone. veins.
好啊你，居然还打我的主意。那要是白跑一趟，肯定是沾了...咦，等等，这千年冰心石的数量好像有点多。¤Okay, you still hit me. If it is a waste of time, it must be stained... Hey, wait, the number of Bingxin Stones in this thousand years seems to be a bit large.
反正我是陪你来的，亏了算你的，嘿嘿。¤Anyway, I came with you, it's your fault, hehe.
嗯，不过那家伙不知道跑哪去了，若只是些千年冰心石，我们可是白跑一趟。¤Well, but that guy doesn't know where he went, if it's just some thousand-year-old ice heart stones, we'll be running for nothing.
这里好像有冰心石，品阶还不低的样子，若这里真有元婴妖兽，那至少也应该是千年冰心石吧。¤There seems to be a Bingxin Stone here, and its rank is not low. If there are really Nascent Soul monsters here, it should be at least a thousand-year-old Bingxin Stone.
快些收了这万载冰心石，我们回林府吧。¤Hurry up and collect these ten thousand years of ice heart stone, let's go back to the Lin Mansion.
听说五品神识系妖丹可以用来炼制强化神识的高品阶丹药，所以想收集一些而已，但看来是我仙缘不足，今天不能如愿了。¤I heard that the fifth-grade soul sense system demon pills can be used to refine high-grade medicinal pills that strengthen spiritual consciousness, so I want to collect some, but it seems that my immortal fate is not enough, and I can't do it today.
要那妖丹做什么？¤What do you want that demon pill to do?
可惜没找到那元婴妖兽，我对它的妖丹倒是有些兴趣。¤It's a pity that I couldn't find the Nascent Soul Monster Beast, but I'm a little interested in its demon pill.
嘿嘿，那可不是。¤Hey, that's not it.
还真把自己代入跟班啦？这么强力的跟班，可要让其他修士羡慕死了。¤Are you really substituting yourself into a follower? Such a powerful follower would make other cultivators envious.
啧，林小姐真是大方，以后有这种好事别忘了也叫上小的。¤Tsk, Miss Lin is really generous, don't forget to call her a junior if there is such a good thing in the future.
好吧。不过这万载冰心石我也不太感兴趣，就当是你陪我来探险的小费好了，嘻嘻。¤Ok. But I'm not too interested in this ten thousand years of ice heart stone, just take it as a tip for you to accompany me to explore, hee hee.
说不定是刚好离开洞穴了吧，既然如此，我还是先把万载冰心石挖下来，好歹算是点收获。¤Maybe I just left the cave. In that case, I’d better dig the Wanzai Bingxin Stone first, it’s a little gain.
我上次确实是在这附近感应到了它强大的神识，但今天却是在秘宝的辅助下都没有任何发现。¤I did sense its powerful divine consciousness near here last time, but today I didn't find anything with the help of the secret treasure.
进来之后除了那金丹期的小蜘蛛，我们好像都没碰见什么。¤After we came in, we didn't seem to have encountered anything except the little spider from the Golden Core Stage.
你之前提到的那个妖兽呢？¤What about the monster you mentioned earlier?
但林沐心出奇地没有在意，而是皱着眉头不知在想什么。¤But Lin Muxin didn't care, she frowned and didn't know what she was thinking.
不愧是林家二小姐。¤As expected of the second Miss Lin family.
想起当年在结侣大典上的万载冰心石所铸银色冠，你不禁有些唏嘘。¤Thinking of the silver crown cast by the Wanzai Bingxin Stone at the wedding ceremony, you can't help but sigh.
我家可是有一顶完全以万载冰心石铸成的银色冠，比天然矿脉好看多了。¤In my house, there is a silver crown made entirely of 10,000-year-old ice core stone, which is much prettier than the natural ore veins.
虽然，不是特别多，也不算特别稀有，而且没想象中好看，但真是第一次见到天然的万载冰心石矿脉呢！¤Although it's not too many, it's not too rare, and it doesn't look as good as I imagined, but it's the first time I've seen the natural Wanzai Bingxin Stone vein!
当然啊，我还是第一次看到万载冰心石矿脉呢！¤Of course, this is the first time I have seen Wanzai Bingxin Stone veins!
怎么，{$LIn}很兴奋？¤What, {$LIn} is excited?
洞窟尽头，一簇晶石正闪烁着银白之光，如雾凇沆砀，清冷异常。¤At the end of the cave, a cluster of spar is shining with silver-white light, like smog, and it is unusually cold.
噢！果然有万载冰心石矿脉！¤Oh! Sure enough, there are ten thousand years of ice core stone veins!
噢！是万载冰心石矿脉！¤Oh! It's a ten thousand years of ice heart stone veins!
而始作俑者——一只元婴期的冥蛛，正堵在洞口，已是趁你检查林沐心伤势的时间完成下一击的蓄力。¤And the initiator, a ghost spider in the Nascent Soul stage, is blocking the entrance of the hole, and is already charging for the next blow while you are examining Lin Muxin's injury.
你连忙上前检查林沐心的伤情，好在她虽是身受重伤，但本就很强大的神识在法宝的被动保护下并无大碍，只是暂时失去了战斗力而已。¤You hurriedly stepped forward to check Lin Muxin's injury. Fortunately, although she was seriously injured, her powerful soul sense was not a big problem under the passive protection of the magic weapon, but she only temporarily lost her combat effectiveness.
只听她一声惨叫，凄艳的鲜血随之沾染了你的衣袍。¤You only heard her scream, and the dreary blood stained your robe.
嗯？啊！¤Ok? what!
{$Lin},小心！¤{$Lin}, be careful!
不，我们一起上，省得让它跑了。¤No, let's go together to save it from running.
好，交给我，你先把伤情稳住。¤Well, leave it to me, you can stabilize the injury first.
没事，小伤而已，先宰了这孽畜再说。¤It's okay, it's just a minor injury, let's slaughter this evil beast first.
{$NickName}，你怎么样？你可不能出事啊...¤{$NickName}, how are you? You can't have an accident...
你一边应承着林沐心，一边小心翼翼的操控着法宝试探着阵法。¤While you promised Lin Muxin, you carefully controlled the magic weapon to test the formation.
你见法宝来不及撤回，只得一把将林沐心扯入怀中，而后抱着她勉强侧身，尽力驱动神通挡住那道银芒。¤When you saw that the magic weapon was too late to withdraw, you had to pull Lin Muxin into his arms, and then hugged her reluctantly to the side, trying his best to drive the magical power to block the silver light.
正在你转头想与林沐心说什么时，却瞥见一束银芒飞刺向毫无防备的林沐心。¤Just when you turned your head and wanted to say something to Lin Muxin, you caught a glimpse of a silver beam flying towards the unsuspecting Lin Muxin.
唔，不愧是五品矿材，想完整的取下来还真没那么容...¤Well, as expected of a fifth-grade mineral, it's really not that easy to remove it completely...
你一边应承着林沐心，一边小心翼翼的操控着法宝，想把这万载冰心石完整的从矿脉中凿出。¤While you promised Lin Muxin, you carefully controlled the magic weapon, trying to completely chisel out the ten thousand years of ice core stone from the mineral vein.
不过这阵法很是简单，只需...¤But it's very simple, just...
嗯，正是如此，而且我们眼前的万载冰心石也是幻象而已，真实的冰心石应该在阵内的其他位置。¤Well, that is exactly the case, and the Wanzai Bingxin Stone in front of us is just an illusion. The real Bingxin Stone should be in other positions in the array.
啊，难怪我们之前都没能发觉万载冰心石的气息，原来是被这阵法遮掩了么？¤Ah, it's no wonder that we haven't been able to detect the breath of Wanzai Bingxinshi before. Was it hidden by this formation?
可能要稍微等我一会了，这里竟以万载冰心石为基础，形成了一个小型的天然幻阵。¤It might have to wait for me for a while, but a small natural magic formation was formed here based on the Wanzai Bingxin Stone.
我就不信你没什么怕的。¤I don't believe you have nothing to fear.
你轻笑着将冥蛛驱逐至洞窟之外。¤You chuckle and drive the spider out of the cave.
哼，凡人不也会怕能被随意碾死的小虫子。¤Hmph, mortals aren't afraid of little bugs that can be run over at will.
哦？你一个元婴修士居然怕金丹期的冥蛛？¤Oh? You, a Nascent Soul cultivator, are actually afraid of the ghost spiders of the Jindan stage?
快把它赶走，我讨厌虫子。¤Get it out of here, I hate bugs.
嗯？金丹期的冥蛛？¤Ok? A ghost spider in the Jindan period?
（地阶上品傀儡么，此处大概是中继阵基吧。）¤(A top-grade puppet on the ground level, this is probably the relay formation base.)
（虽然时间紧迫，但先想法办解除阵法应该会在之后的战斗中更有优势。）¤(Although time is tight, thinking about how to disarm the formation first should give you an advantage in subsequent battles.)
嗯，好，我们快去救宫主吧。¤Well, okay, let's go save the palace master.
{$Lin}放心，有我在，不会有事的。¤{$Lin}Don't worry, I'll be fine with me.
唔，那也只能向前了。¤Well, that can only go forward.
嗯，好，那我们快去救宫主吧。¤Well, okay, then let's go save the palace master.
{$Lin}放心，我会保护你的。¤{$Lin}Don't worry, I'll protect you.
那怎么办，我们先退出去观察下情况么？¤So what should we do, shall we exit first to observe the situation?
不但被加强不止一星半点，还加入许多变化，看来我们贸然进入是有些莽撞了。¤Not only has it been strengthened by more than a little bit, but also many changes have been added. It seems that we are a bit reckless to enter rashly.
这...我从未见过如此不祥的阵法，感觉就像一个更为强大的落魂阵。¤This... I have never seen such an ominous formation, it feels like a more powerful soul-falling formation.
一进入阵法中，空间便是昏暗了起来，你们纵是作为修仙之人也难以视物，除此之外更是有刺耳的哀嚎不断地传入你们耳中，其中夹杂着的尖利悲啸刺激着你们的魂体，以至于都不敢展开神识探测，只能靠肉眼勉强辨认，而后谨慎摸索前进。¤As soon as you enter the formation, the space becomes dark, and even if you are immortals, it is difficult for you to see things. In addition, there are piercing mourning constantly entering your ears, which are mixed with sharp whistles It stimulates your soul body, so that you dare not start the detection of spiritual consciousness, you can only recognize it with the naked eye, and then cautiously grope forward.
{color=#d0380a}西南方{/color}好像有战斗的波动，宫主应该在那边。希望她能坚持到我们过去。¤{color=#d0380a}The southwest{/color} seems to have fluctuations in battle, and the Palace Master should be there. Hope she can stick to our past.
（这傀儡看起来绝非凡物，大约有普通元婴修士实力，应该是核心阵基之一了。）¤(This puppet looks extraordinary, it has the strength of an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator, and it should be one of the core formation bases.)
你略一沉思，而后巧妙的运用几缕灵气轻易破除了此处阵基。¤You pondered for a while, and then skillfully used a few wisps of spiritual energy to easily break the formation here.
（唔，这里似乎是个核心阵基，但...我的阵道领悟不够...）¤(Well, this seems to be a core formation base, but...my understanding of formation is not enough...)
（唔，此处似乎是一处核心阵基。）¤(Well, it seems to be a core formation here.)
磔磔磔，待我将你们擒下，便将你小子的血肉神魂尽皆炼为灵气，为我冲虚散人的化神之路添上一块踏脚石。至于林沐心嘛，就让你感受一番曾让我思过百年的采补之术好了。可惜恒...¤Ding Ding Ding, when I capture you all, I will refine all your flesh, blood, spirit, and soul into spiritual energy, adding a stepping stone to my path to Deity Transformation. As for Lin Muxin, just let you experience the harvesting and nourishing technique that has made me think for a hundred years. It's a pity he...
可惜刚才下手重了点，让宫主当场陨落了，不然还能让你们一起做个伴，磔磔磔。¤It's a pity that I started a little harder just now, and the palace lord fell on the spot, otherwise, I can still let you all be companions together, 磔 磔.
哼，知道了。¤Hum, got it.
别多嘴！¤shut up!
磔磔磔，待我将你俩擒下，便让你们感受下这曾害我思过百年的采补之术，可惜恒...¤Deng Deng Deng, when I capture you two, I will let you experience this technique of harvesting and replenishing that has made me think for a hundred years, but it is a pity...
哼，我就道阵法怎么可能出了问题，果然是你们这两只老鼠。不过也无妨，我亲爱的星宫宫主已经陨落，接下来就轮到你们了。¤Hmph, I wondered how could there be a problem with the formation, it really is you two mice. But it doesn't matter, my dear star palace master has fallen, and it's your turn next.
两人感应到你们的气息，转头看向你们。¤The two sensed your breath and turned to look at you.
你们二人来到西南方的阵眼，冲虚散人与一位不明身份的修士正在此商量着什么。¤The two of you came to the array eye in the southwest, where Chongxu Sanren and an unidentified cultivator were discussing something.
不满在冲虚散人脸上一闪而逝，而后便攻向你，而那神秘修士则是缠上林沐心。¤Dissatisfaction flashed on the face of Chongxu Sanren, and then attacked you, while the mysterious cultivator was entangled in Lin Muxin.
少跟他们啰嗦，赶紧动手。¤Stop talking to them, and act quickly.
下辈子可要记好别再惹我。哦不，我要让你们的血肉神魂都被炼作灵气，为我冲虚散人的化神之路再添两枚踏脚石，方能解我心头之恨！¤Remember to stop messing with me in your next life. Oh no, I want all of your flesh and soul to be refined into qi, and add two more stepping stones to my path to Deity Transformation, so that the hatred in my heart can be relieved!
你们这两只老鼠既已闯入我这奇门绝魂阵，就让你们见识下阵法的威能吧，磔磔磔。¤Now that you two mice have broken into my Qimen Soulless Formation, let you experience the power of the formation, 飔飔飔.
哼，方才还在想阵法出了什么问题，果然是有老鼠进来了啊，不过也无妨，我亲爱的宫主已经陨落，接下来就到你们了。¤Hmph, just now I was still thinking about what went wrong with the formation. Sure enough, a mouse came in, but it doesn't matter, my dear palace master has fallen, and it's up to you next.
他身旁则是一位遮住面部的不明修士，在你们近旁还有重伤倒地的星宫宫主。¤Next to him is an unknown cultivator covering his face, and next to you is the star palace palace master who was seriously injured and fell to the ground.
你们二人来到西南方的阵眼，冲虚散人屹立于阵法空间中，其周身环绕着悲啸的怨魂，宣示着冲虚散人阵法主人的身份。¤The two of you came to the formation eye in the southwest, and the Chongxu Sanren stood in the space of the formation, surrounded by mournful and whistling resentful souls, declaring the identity of the master of the Chongxu Sanren formation.
你们二人来到西南方的阵眼，冲虚散人屹立于昏暗的阵法空间中，宣示着冲虚散人阵法主人的身份。¤The two of you came to the formation eye in the southwest, and the Chongxu Sanren stood in the dim formation space, declaring the identity of the master of the Chongxu Sanren formation.
磔磔磔，我刚才还觉得少了些什么，这就送上门来了么。¤Ying Ying Ying, I felt that something was missing just now, so it will be delivered to your door.
你们二人来到西南方的阵眼，冲虚散人屹然立于昏暗的阵法空间中，其周身环绕着悲啸的怨魂，宣示着冲虚散人阵法主人的身份。¤The two of you came to the eye of the formation in the southwest, and the Chongxu Sanren stood in the dark formation space, surrounded by mournful resentful souls, declaring the identity of the master of the Chongxu Sanren formation.
哼，我就道阵法怎么可能出了问题，果然是你们这两只老鼠。不过也无妨，就让你们见识见识我古神教的强大秘术吧。¤Hmph, I wondered how could there be a problem with the formation, it really is you two mice. But it doesn't matter, let you see the powerful secret techniques of my ancient gods.
你们二人来到西南方的阵眼，冲虚散人与一位不明身份的修士正在失去效用的阵法中商量着什么。¤The two of you came to the array eye in the southwest, and the Chongxu Sanren and an unidentified cultivator were discussing something in the ineffective array.
罢了，我们也回去吧。¤Well, let's go back too.
她居然是化神期...¤She is actually a Deity Transformation cultivator...
她，就这么走了？¤Did she just leave?
不知是因为那脸上难掩的苦涩，还是对你们冷漠的态度，让你突然觉得这张脸又陌生了起来。¤I don't know if it was because of the bitterness that was hard to hide on the face, or because of the indifferent attitude towards you, that suddenly made you feel that this face was unfamiliar again.
星铃儿朝你和林沐心看了一眼，而后便直接往星宫方向踏空而去，其速度之快远超元婴修士的极限，甚至即便是擅长遁术的元婴巅峰修士燃血而遁也难企及。¤Xing Ling'er glanced at you and Lin Muxin, and then walked directly towards the Xing Palace. Its speed far exceeded the limit of Yuan Ying cultivators, and even the peak Yuan Ying cultivators who were good at escape techniques burned their blood and escaped. Also difficult to reach.
甚至本应在此的冲虚散人也不知是化为了齑粉还是被在刚在的战斗中被击飞到了不知何处。至于逃跑，他肯定是没这个能耐。¤Even the Chongxu scattered people who were supposed to be here didn't know whether they were turned into dust or were knocked flying to somewhere unknown in the battle just now. As for escaping, he must not have the ability.
映入眼帘的，只有广袤的天空，无垠的黄土，矗立于中的橘裙女性修士以及她怀抱里的另一位身着蓝裙疑似宫主的女修。除此之外，再无它物。¤All that came into view were the vast sky, the boundless loess, the orange-dressed female cultivator standing in the middle, and another female cultivator in a blue dress who was suspected of being the palace master in her arms. Other than that, nothing else.
你走过去将林沐心扶起，而后将目光投向战斗所在地。¤You walked over to help Lin Muxin up, and then turned your attention to the battle site.
这就是化神强者么，竟恐怖如斯...¤Is this the powerhouse of Deity Transformation, so terrifying...
而一旁的林沐心就有些狼狈了，她毕竟不擅长于防御一道，面对化神强者一击的余波竟已是跌坐在地，久久未能站起身来。¤Lin Muxin, who was on the side, was a little embarrassed. After all, she was not good at defending. Facing the aftermath of the Deity Transformation powerhouse's blow, she fell to the ground and failed to stand up for a long time.
战斗的余波携天地之威四溢，周遭的灵植凡木尽皆化为飞灰。你们由于所处的位置较近，也是切身体会了这一击余波的威力。¤The aftermath of the battle overflowed with the might of heaven and earth, and all the surrounding spiritual plants and trees were turned into ashes. Because you are in a relatively close position, you have also personally experienced the power of the aftermath of this blow.
你倒还好，只感觉像是一条元婴期暴龙迎面撞来，虽让你有些气血骤起且行气不畅，但还勉强能保持站立的姿态。¤You're not too bad, it just feels like a Nascent Soul Tyrannosaurus slams into your face. Although you have some qi and blood, and your breath is sluggish, you can barely maintain a standing posture.
正当你们猜测来者是谁时，那边已经是开战。¤Just when you were guessing who was coming, there was already a war over there.
林沐心只是迷茫的摇摇头，示意自己完全没头绪。¤Lin Muxin just shook her head in confusion, indicating that she was completely clueless.
好像是阵法被破后引来了化神修士...此处接近竹山宗和化尘教，难道是这两派中的高人？¤It seems that after the formation was broken, the Deity Transformation cultivators were attracted... This place is close to the Bamboo Mountain sect and the dust sect, is it the master of these two sects?
你们正在赶往之前战斗波动出现的位置时，却看见一位修士自东北方踏空而来，其速度之快远超元婴修士的极限，甚至即便是擅长遁术的元婴巅峰修士燃血而遁也难企及。¤When you were rushing to the position where the previous battle fluctuations appeared, you saw a cultivator coming from the northeast, and his speed far exceeded the limit of the Nascent Soul cultivator, and even the peak Nascent Soul cultivator who was good at escape was burning blood And escape is hard to come by.
去其他地方看看吧。¤Look elsewhere.
而且，那洞府只怕也是在战斗中被夷为平地了。¤Moreover, the cave mansion was probably razed to the ground during the battle.
嗯，方位肯定不会错，看来是在战斗中出现了什么变故。导致这本该是副门主洞府的地方灵气失衡，乃至数日过去还未恢复。¤Well, the orientation is definitely not wrong, it seems that something changed during the battle. As a result, the spiritual energy of this place, which was supposed to be the deputy sect master's cave residence, was out of balance, and it has not recovered even after several days.
难道...¤Is it...
这里的灵气浓度还不及武陵城客栈，他一个金丹修士怎会于此设下洞府？¤The concentration of aura here is not as good as that of the Wuling City Inn. How could he, a Jindan cultivator, set up a cave here?
奇怪，他们副门主的洞府应该就在此处才对。¤Strangely, the cave mansion of their deputy sect master should be here.
其他也没什么了，去其他地方看看吧。¤Nothing else, let's look elsewhere.
看来这门主与那魔修战力相差确实不止一星半点。¤It seems that the difference in combat power between this sect master and that evil cultivator is indeed more than a star and a half.
若不是{$ZaiXia}有位师妹正好与其相识，曾在传音符中留下过神识印记确认了其身死，只看这战场还以为他已是脱身而去。¤If it wasn't for a junior sister in {$ZaiXia} who happened to be acquainted with him, who had left a mark of divine consciousness in the sound transmission to confirm his death, he would have thought that he had escaped just by looking at this battlefield.
嗯。据言此处就是该门派门主的洞府所在，而那门主被魔修一剑斩入药田后，应当是尸骨无存。¤Ok. It is said that this is where the sect master's cave dwelling is located, and after the sect master was cut into the medicine field with a sword from the evil cultivator, there should be no bones left.
看来这里就是主要战场了。¤It seems that this is the main battlefield.
这块不大的药田已是被那魔修斜斩成两半，药田中的剑痕先不说深度，单单其中看似缓慢却不断弥漫的血气就足以让金丹修士倒吸一口凉气。若不是有这血气剑痕的存在，只怕洞府阵法内的“灵雾“早已消失殆尽。¤This small medicine field has been slashed in half by the evil cultivator. The depth of the sword marks in the medicine field is not to mention the depth. The seemingly slow but continuous blood energy in the medicine field is enough to make Jindan cultivator take a deep breath. . If it weren't for the existence of this bloody sword mark, I'm afraid the spiritual mist in the cave formation would have disappeared long ago.
而那药田也只是形状保持完整而已。¤And that medicine field is only the shape remains intact.
说是废墟，但细看之后反倒觉得废墟都不至于如此残破。除药田还相对完整外，把炼丹房，炼器房与修炼用的密室那切口平整的残垣拼凑在一块，可能都找不出一面完整的墙壁。¤It is said to be a ruin, but after a closer look, I feel that the ruins are not so dilapidated. In addition to the relatively complete medicine field, if the alchemy room, the refining room, and the secret room used for cultivation are put together with the flat cut debris, it is possible that there is no complete wall.
透过这“灵雾”，映入眼帘的便是阵法的废墟。¤Through this spirit fog, what comes into view is the ruins of the formation.
而阵法内部，清晰可见的灵气稀释了粘稠的血气，以奇异的方式结合成淡粉色的“灵雾”。¤Inside the formation, the clearly visible spiritual energy diluted the viscous blood energy and combined into a pale pink spiritual mist in a strange way.
这里本应是一处洞府，如今只剩一角残破阵法尚在吸收外界的天地灵气，但该阵法的其他威能尽失如今也只是相当于一个低阶的聚灵阵而已。¤This was supposed to be a cave, and now there is only a corner of the broken formation that is still absorbing the spiritual energy of the world, but the other powers of the formation are lost, and now it is only equivalent to a low-level spirit gathering formation.
嗯，室内的物事也没有被动过。门派弟子应该都战死在宗门大阵那里了。¤Well, indoor things have not been passive. The disciples of the sect should have all died in the Zongmen Great Array.
嗯，室内的物事也没有被动过。门派弟子应该都在其他地方被斩杀了。¤Well, indoor things have not been passive. The disciples of the sect should have been beheaded elsewhere.
此处是弟子居所。这里...完全没有战斗留下的痕迹。¤This is where the disciples live. Here... no trace of the battle at all.
是未被战斗波及，但，此处也可以说是发生过战斗。¤It was not affected by the battle, but it can also be said that a battle has occurred here.
这里便是藏经阁，看来此处未被战斗波及，建筑都还算完好。¤This is the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion. It seems that this place has not been affected by the battle, and the buildings are still in good condition.
{FirstName}{$NickName}观察真是细致，若不是有你提醒，在下险些没想到。¤{FirstName}{$NickName}'s observation is really meticulous. If it wasn't for your reminder, I would have never thought of it.
对于一个血剑宫魔修而言，这种小门派的功法神通应该没什么吸引力才对。¤For a blood sword palace evil cultivator, such a small sect's magical powers should not be attractive.
不会，虽然阵法已经被毁，但阵基所在之处还有灵核残留。那血剑宫魔修应是在解决了所有修士后，以某种手段破除这藏经阁的守护阵法，并在其中停留了一小段时间，只是不知出于何种目的。¤No, although the formation has been destroyed, there are still spiritual cores where the formation is located. The blood sword palace evil cultivator should have solved all the cultivators, broke the guardian formation of this bookstore by some means, and stayed in it for a short period of time, but for some unknown purpose.
咦？确实是诶，我都没注意到。会不会是他们藏经阁一直都没有用阵法来守护呢？¤Huh? Yeah, I didn't notice it. Could it be that their Book Collection Pavilion has never been guarded by a formation?
藏经阁这种门派重地怎会没有阵法守护呢？¤How could there not be an array of protection in a sect such as the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion?
我不太明白...¤I do not quite understand...
但，现在，显然还不是时候。\n¤But, now is clearly not the time. \n
听完你的话，他陷入沉思。藏经阁也因此恢复了寂静，且会在你们离开之后长久地沉陷于寂静之中。¤After hearing your words, he fell into deep thought. The Tibetan Sutra Pavilion has thus recovered its silence, and will remain silent for a long time after you leave.
唔...¤Well...
损耗并不大，此人破阵的风格可比战斗时的手段柔和多了。¤The loss is not large, and this person's style of breaking the formation is much softer than the means of fighting.
原来如此，我明白了，还是{FirstName}{$NickName}观察细致，我竟一时疏忽未留意到这藏经阁没有阵法。¤It turned out to be the case, I understand, but {FirstName}{$NickName} observed carefully, and I was negligent and didn't notice that there was no formation in this library.
也许他对小门派的藏经阁不屑一顾，或是灭门完赶紧离开了吧。\n¤Maybe he was dismissive of the small sect's Tibetan scriptures pavilion, or he should leave quickly after destroying the door. \n
正是如此。看来这血剑宫魔修在战后还于此停留过一段时间，就是不知出于何种目的。照常理来说，这种小门派的功法神通他应该看不上眼才对。¤exactly. It seems that this blood sword palace evil cultivator stayed here for a while after the war, just for some unknown purpose. According to common sense, he should not look down on the magical powers of this kind of small sect.
我也不知为何，还是去其他地方看看吧。¤I don't know why, let's look elsewhere.
（居然还有闲情逸致把秘籍全毁掉么。）¤(Is there still a leisurely feeling to destroy all the cheats?)
正常人灭门之后不是应该尽快离开现场么，他为何要把藏经阁中的秘籍都毁掉？¤Shouldn't a normal person leave the scene as soon as possible after destroying the door, why would he destroy all the secrets in the Bookstore Pavilion?
只见藏经阁一层的地板上满是碎屑。有的是被绞成齑粉的书籍，有的则是被捏碎的玉佩，当然，也有少数不知名材质的碎渣。料想应该是用来记载相对高阶的功法或神通。¤I saw that the floor on the first floor of the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion was full of debris. Some are books that have been twisted into powder, some are jade pendants that have been crushed, and of course, there are also a few slag of unknown materials. It is expected that it should be used to record relatively high-level exercises or supernatural powers.
你走上前去，视线越过{$npcid}投向室内。¤You step forward, looking past {$npcid} into the room.
{$ZaiXia}不知道该怎么说，还是{FirstName}{$Nickname}自己来看吧。¤{$ZaiXia} doesn't know what to say, but {FirstName}{$Nickname} will see for yourself.
怎么了？¤What's going on?
只听“吱呀”一声，藏经阁的古旧大门应声而开，于此同时一声短促像是经过压抑的低声惊呼传入你的耳中。¤Just listening to the squeak, the ancient door of the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion opened in response, and at the same time, a short exclamation like a suppressed low voice entered your ears.
{$npcid}一边说着，一边就打算推门进入藏经阁。¤As {$npcid} spoke, he planned to push the door and enter the Tibetan Scriptures Pavilion.
嗯，我们进去看看吧。¤Well, let's go in and see.
看来这血剑宫魔修在战后还于此停留过一段时间，就是不知出于何种目的。照常理来说，这种小门派的功法神通他应该看不上眼才对。¤It seems that this blood sword palace evil cultivator stayed here for a while after the war, just for some unknown purpose. According to common sense, he should not look down on the magical powers of this kind of small sect.
你右手一挥，一些灵核碎片从藏经阁周遭的隐蔽处向你飞来。途中剔除一些已被损耗的碎片后，将相对完好的部分收入储物袋中。¤With a wave of your right hand, some spiritual core fragments flew towards you from the hidden places around the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion. After removing some worn-out fragments on the way, the relatively intact parts are put into the storage bag.
损耗并不大，此人破阵的风格可比传闻中的手段柔和多了。¤The loss is not large, and this person's style of breaking the formation is much softer than the rumored method.
不无可能。¤Not impossible.
可能是为了激起这小门派的门主与副门主的愤怒？然后让他们因此在战斗中露出更多破绽什么的...¤Maybe it was to arouse the anger of the sect master and deputy sect master of this small sect? And then let them show more flaws in the battle or something...
也许只是随意地一刀刚好劈在牌位上吧，这里好像没有其他值得注意的东西了。¤Maybe it's just a random knife that just hits the tablet, there seems to be nothing else worth noting here.
有太多种可能，在下目前也没头绪。¤There are too many possibilities, and I have no clue at the moment.
有太多种可能，我目前也没头绪。¤There are so many possibilities, I don't have a clue right now.
这一剑看起来像是故意落在牌位上，但此举有什么意义呢。¤This sword looks like it was deliberately dropped on the tablet, but what's the point of this move.
供桌已经是断为三截，正中的一截与其上本摆放着的牌位在神通之下早已化为飞灰，左右两截则与剩下的牌位一同散落在剑痕附近。¤The offering table had already been broken into three pieces, the middle piece and the tablet on the top had already been turned into ashes under the supernatural power, and the left and right pieces were scattered around the sword marks along with the rest of the tablet.
而当中供奉的祖师牌位及其供桌就没这么好运了。¤And the patriarch tablet and its offering table enshrined in it are not so lucky.
这里本是大殿，门派传承中最重要的地方。但如今已是被一剑由当中斩作两半，徇剑痕望去，大殿中的蒲团和雕塑等物事都还完好，只是落了些灰在上面而已。¤This is the main hall, the most important place in the inheritance of martial arts. But now it has been cut in half by a sword, and looking at the sword marks, the futons and sculptures in the hall are still intact, but some dust has fallen on them.
想不到{$NpcName}对这里还挺熟悉。¤Unexpectedly, {$NpcName} is quite familiar with this place.
{color=#d0380a}副门主洞府{/color}还未去过，要去看看么？\n¤{color=#d0380a}I haven't been to the Vice Sect Master's Cave Mansion{/color}, should I go take a look? \n
{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}还未去过，先去看看吧。¤{color=#d0380a}The Book Collection Pavilion{/color} hasn’t been there yet, so let’s take a look first.
是护宗阵法方向！我们快过去。¤It is the direction of the guardian formation! Let's go quickly.
可惜副门主洞府附近的阵法已被那莽夫破坏殆尽了，不然还能再多一金丹修士的生魂，只能将就将就了，磔磔磔。¤It's a pity that the formation near the cave mansion of the deputy sect master has been completely destroyed by the reckless man. Otherwise, there will be one more soul of a Jindan cultivator.
磔磔，那血剑宫的疯子果然上门找麻烦了，没白费我偷溜进来后暗中设下的拘魂阵。¤Deng Deng, the madman from the Blood Sword Palace really came to the door to ask for trouble, and it didn't waste the soul arrest array that I secretly set up after sneaking in.
你与{$NpcName}正讨论时，一阵阴恻恻的笑声从护宗阵法方向传来。¤When you and {$NpcName} were discussing, a gloomy laughter came from the direction of the guardian formation.
嗯，稍微知道些。¤Well, know a little bit.
毕竟是在下的任务，还是有过了解的。只是掌握的信息还是太少，在下也提供不了更多的帮助了。¤After all, it is the next task, and I have already understood it. It's just that the information I have is still too little, and I can't provide more help.
是有过了解，但也只知道这么多。¤Yes, I know, but only so much.
嘿嘿，其实是接受任务时有给我讲述过啦。¤Hehe, it was actually told to me when I accepted the quest.
{$NpcName}也不急着出手攻击，而是转过头来与你交换了个眼神。¤{$NpcName} didn't rush to attack, but turned his head and exchanged glances with you.
{$NpcName}一击破坏那脆弱的拘魂阵后，在阵中邪修惊愕的眼神中，你的攻击不期而至。¤After {$NpcName} destroyed the fragile Soul Retention Formation with one blow, your attack came unexpectedly in the stunned eyes of the evil cultivators in the formation.
好，交给{$ZaiXia}吧。¤OK, let's go to {$ZaiXia}.
让我来吧，{$NpcName}在一旁看着别让他跑了就好，我还有很多事情想好好问问他呢。¤Let me do it, {$NpcName} just watch and don't let him run away, I still have a lot of things I want to ask him.
{$NpcName}见状也不犹豫，手捏法诀，就要驱使法宝攻击阵法。¤Seeing this, {$NpcName} didn't hesitate, pinched the magic trick, and then drove the magic weapon to attack the formation.
你们二人赶到宗门大阵附近时，那人正站在不知何时设下的拘魂阵中，试图淬炼手中满是繁复密纹的深色幡类法宝。¤When the two of you arrived near the Zongmen Grand Formation, the man was standing in the Soul Detention Formation that was set up at an unknown time, trying to temper the dark banner-like magic weapon full of intricate and dense patterns in his hands.
{$NpcName}过奖了，只是这魔修实力不济而已。¤{$NpcName} has won the prize, but this evil cultivator is not strong enough.
{FirstName}{$NickName}的实力真是让我大开眼界了，原只道金丹修士在战斗时打不过还是能跑的，{FirstName}{$NickName}却能生擒金丹修士，只怕击杀他更是轻而易举。¤The strength of {FirstName}{$NickName} really opened my eyes to me. It turned out that only the cultivator Jindan could still run if he couldn't beat him in battle, but {FirstName}{$NickName} could capture the cultivator Jindan alive. Killing him is even easier.
以你丰富的战斗经验又怎么会放过这等好机会，立时便驱动法宝一顿猛攻，随后而至的强力神通更是直接让其丧失战斗力。¤With your rich combat experience, how could you miss such a good opportunity, and immediately drive the magic weapon to make a fierce attack, and the powerful magical power that follows directly makes it lose its combat effectiveness.
不知是出于顾忌在一旁盯着他的{$NpcName}，还是已然灵气枯竭，这魔修在硬结一记躲不开的攻击神通后，出现了短暂的停顿。¤Whether it was because he was staring at his {$NpcName} out of scruples, or because his spiritual energy was already exhausted, the evil cultivator paused for a while after indulging in an inescapable attack.
{$NpcName}见此情形更是早已放松警惕，在一旁为你鼓掌叫好。¤Seeing this, {$NpcName} has already let down her guard and applauded you from the side.
这魔修虽是实力不错，但还远不如你。初时，他还能与你正面碰撞一番，可几招过后就只能在慌乱中躲闪你的法宝及神通。¤Although this evil cultivator has good strength, it is far from yours. At the beginning, he can collide with you head-on, but after a few moves, he can only dodge your magic weapons and magical powers in a panic.
如今禾山道和沂山派之间已经彻底反目，我还是不要在这里闲逛了。¤Now that there is a complete revolt between the Wo Shan Road and the Yishan Sect, I'd better not wander around here.
沂山双鬼死后，沂山派很快便分崩离析了，如今此地已经成为了一片废墟。¤After the death of the two ghosts of Mount Yi, the Mount Yi sect soon fell apart, and now this place has become a ruin.
在下阴魂岛岛主李司魂，愿为{$xiaoyou}解惑，{$xiaoyou}可有什么想知道的？¤Under the Yin Soul Island Lord Li Si Soul, would like to help {$xiaoyou} to solve the problem, {$xiaoyou} can there be anything you want to know?
神阴石是极阴三海中罕见的纯黑石块，由阴气与神识共同汇集而成，多于一些海岛上出现。¤God Yin stone is a rare pure black stone in the three seas of extreme Yin, brought together by Yin Qi and God Consciousness, mostly found on some islands.
老头，若此话当真，你岂不是重生有望了？¤Old man, if this is true, won't you be reborn hopefully?
自然没有，本座为何要在此处渡劫？¤Naturally not, why should this seat be here for the tribulation?
话虽如此，不过我有预感，此事不会这么简单…¤That said, but I have a hunch that this will not be so simple...
旁白¤narration
阴魂岛内除了适合{color=#d0380a}魂体{/color}修炼之外，最重要的是有一套适合灵魂体的{color=#d0380a}体系{/color}。¤In addition to being suitable for {color=#d0380a}soul body{/color} cultivation within the Island of Yin Souls, the most important thing is that there is a {color=#d0380a} system{/color} for soul bodies.
灵魂体比修士弱得多，如果没有一套互惠的体系，便根本无法立足。¤Soul bodies are much weaker than cultivators, and without a reciprocal system, they simply cannot gain a foothold.
你不再收敛修为，释放出了一丝化神的威压，岛主马上便察觉到了这一点。¤You cease to reign in your cultivation and release a hint of the pressure of a Deity Transformation, which the island master immediately senses.
此乃阴魂岛重地，{$xiaoyou}还是不要靠近为好。¤This is a heavy place on the Island of Yin Souls, {$xiaoyou} or better not to go near it.
此术乃是不知多少万年前，机缘巧合下所得，你又从何听起？¤The art is unknown how many thousands of years ago, by chance, and where did you hear about it?
“老头，在这三冥海渡劫莫非有何不妥？”¤Old man, isn't there something wrong with crossing the tribulation in the Three Deep Seas?
以你化神期的实力，别人自然也看不出任何端倪。¤With your strength at the Deity Transformation stage, others will naturally not be able to see any clues.
你不希望他们因为境界差距而改变对你的态度，便将自身修为隐藏了起来。¤You hid your cultivation because you did not want them to change their attitude towards you because of the difference in realms.
自古以来这阴魂岛便存在于此，至于可以追溯到什么时期老夫也不得而知。¤The island has been in existence since ancient times, but as for how long exactly; no one knows.
不过{$xiaoyou}既然是修士之身，眼下倒是有两件事需要道友帮忙，若能办成其中一件，这逆天造化术便归道友了。¤But {$xiaoyou} since you are in the body of a cultivator, there are two things that I need your help with right now, if I can do one of them, this Reverse Heaven Creation Art will be yours.
老夫也正是因为此物，才在这阴魂岛有些威望。¤The old man is also because of this thing, only in this Yin Soul Island some prestige.
司徒礼意味深长地看了你一眼。¤Situ Li gave you a meaningful look.
整座岛充满了阴郁的气息，看上去不太适合人类居住，也许只有灵魂体会选择栖息在这样的岛上吧。¤The whole island is full of gloomy aura, does not look very suitable for human habitation, perhaps only the soul body will choose to inhabit such an island.
岛主¤Island Lord
越过一座稍微大些的山峰，顿觉柳暗花明——远方赫然有一个极为显眼的灰白色气旋，从地面一直盘旋到天际。众多灵魂体纷纷聚集在气旋四周，场面颇为壮观。¤After crossing a slightly larger peak, I felt a darkness - there was a conspicuous gray-white cyclone in the distance, hovering from the ground to the sky. Many souls have gathered around the cyclone, the scene is quite spectacular.
若你有心，且去了解一下任务内容也无妨。¤If you have the heart, and go to understand the content of the mission can not hurt.
在这极阴三海上，由于被极强的阴气覆盖，一些修为较高或神识较强的修士死后，元神并不会立刻溃散，而是会依附于这阴气之上，形成自己的{color=#d0380a}阴体{/color}。¤In this extreme Yin three sea, due to the extremely strong Yin Qi cover, some cultivators with higher cultivation or stronger soul sense after death, the spirit does not immediately collapse, but will cling to this Yin Qi, forming their own {color=#d0380a} Yin body {/color}.
这重铸肉身之法名为{color=#d0380a}逆天造化术{/color}，灵魂体若使用此术，便可重新铸造一副与生前无二的身躯。¤This recast body method is called {color=#d0380a}reverse sky creation technique{/color}, soul body if you use this technique, you can recast a body that is no different from the one you had before you were born.
“这三冥海阴气极重，恐怕不是渡劫的好地方，你还是不要答应他为好。”¤These Three Deep Seas is extremely heavy with Yin energy, I'm afraid it's not a good place to transmigrate, you'd better not say yes to him.
你自然要说已经找到了解决方法，不然此术岂不是空中楼阁？¤You naturally have to say that you have found a solution, otherwise this art is not a pavilion in the air?
呵呵，之所以还是这副模样，是因为这逆天造化术的使用要求极为严苛。¤The reason why I still look like this is because the requirements for the use of this reverse creation technique are extremely demanding.
只是想不到，有朝一日我还真要用到它。¤I just can't imagine that one day I really need to use it.
呵呵，此术可不是能轻易获得的，只有收集到{color=#d0380a}五块神阴石{/color}才可与我交换，阴魂岛上历来便是这个规矩。¤The actual fact is that this is not an easy technique to obtain, only collect {color=#d0380a}five divine Yin stones {/color} to exchange with me, the Yin Soul Island has always been this rule.
尽管不如正常修士效果明显，但灵魂体也是可以修炼的。¤Although not as effective as normal cultivators, but the soul body can also be cultivated.
“虽然我对渡劫之事知之甚少，不过渡劫地点确实是至关重要、需要好好筛选的。”¤Although I know very little about transmigration, the place of transmigration is indeed crucial and needs to be properly screened.
阴体的本质是我们所依附的阴气，阴气修炼的越凝实，就越接近于修士的身体。¤The essence of the yin body is the yin energy that we are attached to, and the more condensed the yin energy is cultivated, the closer it is to the body of a cultivator.
…若真有这么神奇的秘术，岛主为何不先给自己重铸一个肉身？¤...If there is really such a magical secret art, why doesn't the island master recast a physical body for himself first?
你迟疑地看了他一眼。¤You give him a hesitant look.
嗯…¤Hmmm...
你不知不觉便被这场景吸引了过去。而与此同时，不远处一个极为凝实的灵魂体也发现了你，朝你飞了过来。¤You are unknowingly drawn to this scene. And at the same time, an extremely solid soul body not far away also found you and flew towards you.
…若当真如此，要如何才能获得？¤...If that's true, how do I get it?
我们用外界修士需要的一些情报、草药等，换取{color=#d0380a}神阴石{/color}、以及帮我们清除一些威胁。¤We use some of the information, herbs, etc. that outside cultivators need in exchange for {color=#d0380a} divine Yin stones{/color}, as well as to help us remove some threats.
“嗯。”¤Hmm.
偶尔有外界修士来此交易，由于是互惠互利的关系，外界修士也很少透露我们的存在，避免更多人前来竞争。¤Occasionally, cultivators from outside come here to trade, and as it is a mutually beneficial relationship, outside practitioners rarely reveal our presence to avoid more competition.
那{$xiaoyou}便四处看看罢，有什么不懂的再问老夫便是。¤The {$xiaoyou} will take a look around and ask the old man again if he doesn't understand anything.
那在下便恭候前辈的好消息了。¤Then I will be waiting for good news from the seniors.
这些只是一群小角色，无需理会他们，直接去岛内打探罢。¤These are just a bunch of small players, no need to pay attention to them, go directly to the island to poke around.
主角¤main character
阴气旋能聚集大量的阴气供灵魂体修炼，所以才会有大量的灵魂体聚集于此。¤The soul body will gather a large amount of Yin Qi for the soul body to cultivate, so there will be a large number of soul body gathered in this.
修炼分两个方向，一个是通过{color=#d0380a}神阴石{/color}修炼自己的神识，另一个则是利用{color=#d0380a}阴气旋{/color}修炼自己的{color=#d0380a}阴体{/color}。¤There are two directions of cultivation, one is to cultivate one's divine consciousness through the {color=#d0380a}Shen Yin Stone{/color} and the other is to use the {color=#d0380a}Yin Qi Spiral{/color} to cultivate one's {color=#d0380a}Yin Body{/color}.
听完这番话，你表面陷入沉思，实则是在用神念沟通铁剑中的魏无极。¤After hearing these words, you are in deep meditation on the surface, but in reality, you are using your divine thoughts to communicate with Wei Wuji in the iron sword.
若前辈肯在三冥海渡劫，这逆天造化术在下便双手奉上。¤If senior is willing to cross the tribulation at the Three Deep Seas, I will give you this Heavenly Creation Technique with both hands.
不过老夫已经找到了解决之道，要重回人形不过是时间问题而已。¤But the old man has found a solution, to return to human form is just a matter of time.
此物对修士并无大用，但对我等灵魂体却大有裨益。{$xiaoyou}若有寻到，与我兑换一些天才地宝，也算是互惠互利了。¤This object is not of great use to cultivators, but it is of great benefit to our soul bodies. {If you find it, exchange it with me for some genius treasures, it is also mutually beneficial.
阴体最开始甚至连一块石头都拿不起来，但修炼过后却能如臂使指。阴体修的越强，{color=#d0380a}重铸肉身{/color}的可能性也就越高。¤The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on a stone, but after training you will be able to use your fingers. The stronger the Yin body is cultivated, the higher the possibility of {color=#d0380a} recasting the flesh {/color}.
原来前辈乃是化神修为，此前在下有所不敬，还望前辈海涵…¤I hope you will forgive me for my previous disrespect... Deity Transformation
至于事情的详细内容，道友去向之恒与无尘那打听即可。¤As for the details of what happened, you can just ask Zhiheng and Wudu there.
他浑身灰白，一副饱经风霜的花甲老人模样，一眼看去便觉实力不俗。¤He was covered in gray, a weathered old man look, a glance at it will feel the strength is not bad.
岛上零星点缀着一座座不太高的山，地面也起伏不平。¤The island is sporadically dotted with a not too high mountain, the ground is also undulating.
随着你越来越接近，四周灵魂体也越来越多——他们看上去极为透光，似乎随时都会被风吹散一般。¤As you get closer, there are more and more souls around - they look extremely translucent and seem to be blown away by the wind at any moment.
这…倒也不算什么秘密了。¤This...is not much of a secret.
将阴魂岛作为据点，灵魂体既可以在此{color=#d0380a}修炼{/color}，又可共同抵御外敌，还能吸引特殊的{color=#d0380a}修士{/color}前来{color=#d0380a}交易{/color}，一举三得。¤By using Yin Soul Island as a stronghold, soul bodies can both {color=#d0380a} cultivate here{/color}, defend together against foreign enemies, and attract special {color=#d0380a} cultivators{/color} to {color=#d0380a} trade{/color}, killing three birds with one stone.
此事本座无法答应你，秘术之事就按此前说的来罢。¤This matter cannot be promised to you by the throne, so let the matter of the secret arts be as previously stated.
作为一名修士，灵魂体们无不对你侧目。时常有三五成群的灵魂体小声议论你。¤As a cultivator, the souls are invariably looking at you sideways. From time to time there are groups of three or five soul bodies whispering about you.
况且若这秘术当真如此神奇，我怎会从未听说？¤The actual fact is that if this secret art is really so amazing, how could I have never heard of it?
但这也不是必然之事，至于什么情况元神能留存下来，什么情况不能，就不得而知了。¤But this is not a sure thing, as to what situation the spirit can remain, what situation can not, it is not known.
呵呵，难得有修士来此，欢迎欢迎。¤Oh, it's rare that a cultivator comes here, welcome welcome welcome.
只是…前辈可有考虑过在这三冥海渡劫？¤Just... has senior ever considered crossing the tribulation in these Three Deep Seas?
此乃阴魂岛重地，任何人不得闯入。¤This is an important place on the Island of Yin Souls, no one is allowed to break in.
下面也不知道是危险还是机缘，不值得为此与阴魂岛翻脸。¤It's not clear whether it's danger or chance down there, and it's not worth turning the tables on the Island of the Underworld.
非也在不远处引发了一场骚动，所有目光都被吸引了过去，你便借此机会顺利地潜入了气旋。¤Non also not far away caused a commotion, all eyes were attracted to the past, you will take the opportunity to successfully infiltrate the cyclone.
这阴气气旋把守重重，而且贸然下去也不安全，还是不要冒险为好。¤This Yin Qi cyclone is heavily guarded, and it's not safe to go down there rashly, so it's better not to take any chances.
呵。我倒要看看你有何能耐，竟能如此猖狂。¤Heh. I would like to see what you are capable of, to be so rampant.
…不错，阁下是如何发现我的？¤...Not bad, how did your Excellency find me?
敢问是有何处冒犯了前辈？¤May I ask what has offended you?
你抬手指向了那杆幡。¤You raise your hand and point to the banner.
有了引路人之后，你很快便来到了大长老的所在之处。¤With a guide, you soon arrive at the place where the Great Elders are.
顺着打听来的线索，你飞到了万魂殿大长老的祭炼之地。¤Following the clues you inquired about, you flew to the place of sacrifice of the Grand Elder of the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls.
既然你残害生灵是为了祭炼此幡，只要你将其交出，并且承诺永不再犯，本座便放你们一马。¤Since you killed the spirits in order to sacrifice this banner, if you hand it over and promise never to do it again, I will let you go.
只见一名带着紫色面纱的修士盘腿坐在一个高级聚灵阵中央，正祭炼着一支不似单人能使用的巨幡，其上赫然写了个“万”字。¤A purple-veiled cultivator sits cross-legged in the middle of a high-level spirit gathering formation and is refining a giant streamer that does not look like it could be used by a single person, with the word ten thousand written on it.
哼，何人胆敢擅创我万魂殿？¤Hmph, who dares to create my Ten Thousand Souls Hall without permission?
你本想敛息靠近，静观其变。不料刚落脚，便被发现了。¤You wanted to converge your breath to get closer and wait and see what would happen. Unexpectedly, just after you landed, you were discovered.
这……他们本就是已死之人，在下不过是将其加以利用而已。¤This ...... they are already dead, and I am merely putting them to use.
只见一名带着紫色面纱的修士盘腿坐在一个高级聚灵阵中央，面前插着一支不似单人能使用的巨幡，其上赫然写了个“万”字。¤I saw a purple veiled cultivator sitting cross-legged in the center of a high-level spiritual formation, with a giant streamer in front of him that did not look like a single person could use, with the word 'million' written on it.
恕在下未曾远迎，不知前辈来此有何贵干？¤Forgive me for not welcoming you from afar, but what do you want to do here?
…话是不错。¤...the words are not bad.
见到你后，她便停下了手头之事，站起身来向你作了一揖。¤Upon seeing you, she stopped what she was doing, stood up and bowed to you.
冒犯倒谈不上，不过是除魔卫道，还他们一份安宁罢了。¤I'm just trying to protect them from the devil and give them peace.
毁我阵法，杀我门徒之人便是你了？¤You are the one who destroyed my formation and killed my disciples?
你收集魂体，可就是为了祭炼此幡？¤Do you collect souls for the purpose of making this banner?
我问你，你们在这玄冥海设下多座阵法以残害无辜灵魂，可有此事？¤Let me ask you, is it true that you have set up several formations in this Deep Black Sea to kill innocent souls?
太虚无形，气之本体。肉身虽仍滞留在凡界{color=#d0380a}不断修炼{/color}，精神力量却已经能够沟通太虚之境。¤The Taixu is invisible, the essence of Qi. Although the physical body is still stuck in the mortal realm {color=#d0380a} in constant cultivation{/color}, the spiritual power has been able to communicate with the Great Void Dimension.
逐渐熟悉这种感觉后，你便开始尝试运用这种新的力量施展足以应对天劫到来的法术...¤As you become familiar with this feeling, you begin to try to use this new power to cast spells that are powerful enough to deal with the arrival of the heavenly tribulation...
大首领气得不行，最后决定自己出马，我们负责把幽谷围住别让那猴子跑了就成。¤The big leader was so angry that he finally decided to go out on his own. We were responsible for enclosing the valley and not letting the monkey run away.
禾山派前，只见许多三五成群的修士神色紧张地奔向山谷，口中还囔囔着“大首领”、“灵猴”的字眼，你便也跟了上去。¤In front of the Wo Shan School, you see many cultivators in groups running towards the valley in a tense manner, muttering the words ''Great Chief'' and ''Spirit monkey'', so you follow them.
既然你都知道了，那赶紧跟我去幽谷守着吧。¤Since you know everything, follow me to the valley and guard it.
也不知道他们还记不记得我先前假装沂山派修士的事...前面好像还有不少禾山道的修士。¤I don't know if they still remember the fact that I pretended to be a cultivator of the Yishan School... There seems to be a lot of cultivators from the Heshan Road ahead.
你从储物袋里掏出一点灵石，对这种小门小派的修士来说这已经算是一笔巨财了。¤You take out a little spirit stone from your storage bag, which is already a huge fortune for this kind of little cultivator.
好！还是{xiongdi}你仗义！¤Good! You're righteous, {xiongdi}!
那禾山道修士见此变脸比翻书还快，一张臭脸登时笑出花来，乐呵呵地接下了你的灵石。¤The Heshan Taoist cultivator saw that this change of face was faster than flipping a book, and a stinky face burst into a smile immediately, and he took your spirit stone happily.
由于禾山派手段相较于沂山派更为残忍毒辣，所以周围百姓的处境反倒比之前更加艰难了。¤The people around the area are in an even more difficult situation than before, as the Wo Shan faction is more cruel and vicious than the Yishan faction.
颜老怪¤Yan Laoqi
杜兄？你怎么会在这？¤Brother Du? What are you doing here?
好说，好说。¤Easy to say, easy to say.
你愿意帮我？¤Will you help me?
好一个从正门杀进去，那我便陪你走一遭罢。¤I'll go with you if you want to enter through the front door.
他摇了摇头。¤He shook his head.
一旁的禾山道修士感受到你身上散发出的威压，吓得腿脚发软，跪地求饶。有几个修为高些的倒是率先反应过来，一溜烟跑进了幽谷，应当是去告知大首领了。¤The Heshan Dao cultivator on the side felt the coercion from your body, scared his legs and feet weak, and knelt down to beg for mercy. Some of the higher cultivation bases were the first to react, and ran into the valley in a hurry. They should have gone to inform the Dao. The leader.
你对禾山道知根知底，此地修为最高的也不过是那个血煞老怪，根本不足为惧。但他们聚集人手的目的还是令你有些在意，你决定前去幽谷一探究竟。¤You know the roots of Heshan Dao, and the highest cultivation level here is just the old blood evil monster, which is not to be afraid. But their purpose of gathering manpower still makes you a little concerned, you decide to go to the valley to find out.
“如今我已结丹，便来会会这颜老怪好了。”¤'Now that I have formed my dan, I will come to meet this old Yan monster.''
大首领最近有些焦躁，好像是遇到了瓶颈。¤The big boss has been a little anxious lately, it seems that he has encountered a bottleneck.
还好办正事儿之前你回来了，快点快点...还傻站着干什么呢？¤It's okay to get your business back before you come back, hurry up...what are you doing while standing stupid?
你光明正大地从山门走进禾山道大本营，丝毫不掩饰自己的修为。¤You walked into the Heshan Road base camp from the mountain gate in an open manner, making no secret of your cultivation.
我还说是谁，原来是{xiongdi}你啊。¤I was wondering who it was, but it was {xiongdi} you.
前些日子大首领在山里发现了只妖兽，据说那妖丹服用后对修为有大裨益。这不，兄弟几个都被叫过来一起进山抓妖兽了，可惜那玩意儿跑得飞快，抓了月余连根毛都没捞着...¤A few days ago, the leader found a monster beast in the mountain. It is said that the demon pill will be of great benefit to the cultivation base after taking it. No, the brothers have all been called into the mountain to catch the monster beast together, but it is a pity that the thing ran away I have to hurry, I haven't caught root hair for more than a month...
自从沂山双鬼死后，禾山派没了相互制衡的对象，变得愈发猖獗。¤Since the death of the two ghosts of Mount Yi, the Wo Shan School has become more and more rampant without a counterweight to each other.
杜老二¤Du Lao Er
或许趁他不备之时偷袭于他，会有奇效？¤Perhaps a sneak attack on him when he is unprepared would work wonders?
禾山派为祸一方，若不是此前实力不足，我早就将其铲除了。¤The Harvest Hill Sect has been a scourge to one side. If I had not been weak before, I would have eradicated it long ago.
大哥见谅，我最近这不是出山搜罗供奉来了。你看，这是我在山下得到的，全都给大哥了。¤Big brother, forgive me, I didn't go out of the mountain to collect offerings recently. You see, this is what I got under the mountain, and it's all given to Big Brother.
{w}{w=0.5}你有什么要问的尽管开口！¤{w}{w=0.5} If you have anything to ask, just speak up!
唉，要我说这境界不也挺好的，有什么着急的。金丹期...恐怕我这辈子都到不了喽。¤Oh, if you want me to say that this level is not very good, what's the worry. The golden core period...I am afraid I will never reach it in this life.
你运起敛息术跟上三五成群的禾山道修士，随着他们的脚步来到了幽谷。¤You took the breath-holding technique to follow the three or five groups of Heshan Taoist cultivators, and followed them to the valley.
你是之前那个什么...{FirstName}{LastName}吧？最近山上正缺人手，你{xiaozi}他妈的跑哪去了？¤What the hell are you before... {FirstName}{LastName}, right? There is a shortage of manpower on the mountain recently. Where the hell did you {xiaozi} go?
你上前一脚踹翻了禾山道修士，好歹你修练也小有所成，何必与这些炼气修士虚与委蛇。¤You stepped forward and kicked the cultivator of Heshan Dao. Anyway, you have achieved a little in your training, so why bother with these qi-refining cultivators.
结丹之后，我就经常站在这。¤I have stood here a lot since the Knotty.
这禾山道真本事没多少，门内弟子倒是人数众多...¤This Heshan Dao really doesn't have many skills, but there are many disciples in the door...
我好像没学过敛息术...还是想想别的办法吧。¤I don't seem to have learned how to restrain the breath... Let's think of another way.
偷袭解不了我心中的恨。只有从正门杀进去，我才觉得痛快！¤A sneak attack will not relieve the hatred in my heart. Only when I kill through the front door will I feel the pain!
快点跟我过来，大首领在山里边等着呢！¤Hurry up with me, the big boss is waiting in the mountains!
麻老九¤Mao Lao Jiu
刚到山脚，你便注意到不远处有一股与你实力相近的气息。¤Just as you reach the foot of the hill, you notice an aura of similar strength to yours not far away.
我想就这么冲进去杀他娘的，但是我又打不过颜老怪，怕白亏了这身修为…¤I wanted to go in and kill him, but I couldn't beat Old Monster Yan, and I was afraid I'd lose my training for nothing...
言罢，你二人便直接从正门走进了禾山道。¤With those words, the two of you walked straight through the main gate into Woosung Road.
唉...大掌柜吞了灵兽的妖丹，因修为不足爆体而亡，我们也只能去别处谋生路了......¤Alas... The big boss swallowed the demon pellet of the spirit beast and died due to insufficient cultivation burst body, we can only go elsewhere to find a way to live ......
随着血煞老怪的陨落，一时风光的禾山道已人去楼空，此处已沦落为荒山，没有什么停驻的必要了。¤With the fall of the old blood monster, the momentary scenery of the Wo Shan Road has been empty, this place has been reduced to a deserted mountain, there is no need to stop.
现在可不是到处乱跑的时候...¤Now is not the time to be running around...
这玄古门蹊跷得很，我还是要再转转。¤This Profound Ancient door is so strange that I still need to take another turn.
这玄古门蹊跷得很，我还是先找点轩岚诺吧。¤This Profound Ancient door is fishy as hell, I'd better find some Xuan Lan Nuo first.
凭借的你的修为，轻松破解门上的禁制。¤With your cultivation, it is easy to break the ban on the door.
这些洞府不久前还有人在此修炼，只是不知现在人都在哪里。¤Not long ago there were people practising in these caves, I just don't know where they are now.
这玄古门是找不到材料把自己也炼丹用了？¤Is this Profound Ancient Sect unable to find the materials to make pills for themselves as well?
宗门广场上也没人？¤And no one in the clan square?
算了，先找到人要紧。¤Never mind, it's important to find someone first.
看来这下面便是通向了炼血台吧。¤It seems that this is where the blood refining platform is located.
突然那滴血液，钻入池底。¤Suddenly the drop of blood, burrowing into the bottom of the pool.
在法阵的驱动下池中鲜血持续的沸腾蒸发化为一滴暗金色的血液，散溢出来的血气，被周围的灵植吸收后有一枚朱红的小果结出。¤The blood in the pool continues to boil and evaporate under the power of the spell formation, turning into a drop of dark golden blood, which overflows and is absorbed by the surrounding spiritual plants before a small vermilion fruit is borne.
一进入此地，映入眼帘的就是一只只被钉死在墙壁上的豹麟兽，鲜血入地面的池子中。¤Upon entering this place, what meets the eye is a leopard-lin beast crucified on the wall, its blood into a pool on the floor.
继续看看吧。¤Keep looking.
看来这下面还是别有洞天嘛。¤It seems there is something else down here after all.
眼前的的炼丹房，空无一人。不过架子上一份份丹药与材料倒是吸引你的目光¤The alchemy room in front of you is empty. However, the shelves of pills and materials do catch your eye
正事要紧，还是不要额外生事了。¤It's better not to cause extra trouble when business is at stake.
以你的阵道修为，很难在不惊动他人的情况下破阵。¤With your Dao of Formation training, it is difficult to break the formation without alerting others.
{xiaozi}，留神了这玄古门蹊跷的紧啊。¤{xiaozi}, keep an eye out for this Profound Ancient door fishy tight ah.
与外界全力运转的守山大阵不同，眼前的山门甚至没有值守的弟子。¤Unlike the great mountain guarding formations in full operation outside, the mountain gate in front of us does not even have any disciples on duty.
嗯，守山大阵全力运转之下宗门内部却连巡逻值守的弟子都没有。¤Well, with the Mountain Guarding Formation in full operation, there were not even any disciples on patrol inside the sect.
这玄古门总不能人丁稀少到这个程度吧¤The Profound Ancient Clan can't be this thinly populated, can it?
与外界全力运转的守山大阵格格不入的是眼前的山门甚至没有值守的弟子。¤Unusually for a mountain guarding formation in full operation outside, there are no disciples on guard at the gate.
{xiaozi}，留神了这玄古门的变故恐怕不是小事。¤{xiaozi}, stay tuned I'm afraid this change in the Profound Ancient door is not a trivial matter.
眼前的的炼器室，空无一人。数件法宝挂在墙上，被禁制保护着。¤The smithing room in front of us is empty. Several magic treasures are hanging on the wall, protected by a ban.
轩道友他更是另辟蹊径，彻底摒弃这条路子，看来这原本的炼妖散还是有巨大的隐患。¤Daoist Xuan he even found another way to completely discard this path, it seems that this original demon refining scatter still has huge hidden dangers.
架子上的典籍已经不见了，但是地面上倒是散落着不少记事玉简。¤The canon on the shelf is gone, but there are a number of jade slips of notation scattered on the floor.
看记载好像已经有人开始服用了。¤It seems from the records that some people have already started taking it.
抛开立场不谈，这玄古门倒还真是有些门道，这种事也能办到。¤Position aside, this Profound Ancient Sect really has some ways of doing things like this.
这上面记载了数百年前，玄古门在护法玄蛊道人的主导下研发出了用豹麟兽精血提纯出麒麟血。¤It records that hundreds of years ago, the Profound Ancient Sect, under the leadership of the Guardian Xuan Compass Daoist, developed the use of leopard-lin beast essence blood to purify qilin blood.
不过，若是着重于吸收精血中的能量助人突破，这样妖化的风险大大降低了。¤However, if one focuses on absorbing the energy in the essence blood to help one break through, the risk of demonisation is greatly reduced in this way.
只是神兽血脉那是普通人可以承受的？轻则丧失理智，重则爆体而亡。就算是侥幸过关的人也会长出点什么奇奇怪怪的东西。¤It's just that the divine beast bloodline is something that ordinary people can endure? The lighter it is, the saner it is, the heavier it is, the more it explodes. Even those who are lucky enough to pass the test will grow something strange.
这群疯子...妖兽异能得天独厚，若是龙族麒麟一类顶级血脉成年便是金丹巅峰，自古以来不知引得多少修士垂涎。¤This group of madmen... Spirit Beasts are unique in their abilities, and if they are of the top bloodline of dragons and unicorns, they are at the peak of Jindan, and have been coveted by many cultivators since ancient times.
虽然经过肉体强化，但是炼气期修士基本难以吸收妖力。¤Although strengthened by the flesh, it is basically difficult for Qi refining stage cultivators to absorb demonic energy.
受试者李天炼气中期，炼妖散-筑基期后期豹麟兽血。¤Subject Li Tian, mid Qi refining stage, Demon Refining Dispersion - Late Foundation Stage Leopard Lin Beast Blood.
但因为没有吸收妖力，李天没有任何兽化迹象，反而境界突破。¤However, because he did not absorb the demon power, Li Tian did not show any signs of bestial transformation, instead his realm broke through.
服用后数日修为达到大圆满，且觉醒火系神通，但同时周身长出鳞片出现轻微妖化。¤Within a few days after taking it, his cultivation reached great perfection and he awakened his fire magic power, but at the same time, scales grew around his body and he became slightly demonized.
服用后气息一路暴涨直逼金丹，迅速度过三花聚顶和五气朝元，在凝液成丹阶段狂暴的火灵力失控爆体而亡。¤After taking it, his breath soared all the way up to the Golden Core, quickly passing through the Three Flowers and Five Qi, before the raging fire spirit power burst out of control and killed him at the stage of condensing liquid into a dan.
受试者欧阳海筑基后期，炼妖散-金丹期后期火龙血。¤Subject: Ouyang Hai, late Foundation stage, Demon Refining Dispersion - late Jindan stage Fire Dragon Blood.
四月后，彻底妖化发狂力敌元婴修士不落下风后力竭而亡。¤After four months, he died of exhaustion after completely demonizing and going berserk against a YuanYing cultivator without losing.
三月后，王陵可以轻松施展天阶火系神通，但出现沟通障碍记忆损失。¤After three months, Wang Ling could easily perform the Heavenly Rank Fire Avatar, but there was a communication barrier memory loss.
受试者王陵金丹中期，炼妖散-混合元婴期中期火龙血、麒麟血。¤Subject Wang Ling, mid-Jindan stage, Demon Refining Dispersion - mixed with mid-Fire Dragon Blood and Qilin Blood of the YuanYing stage.
炼妖散？将妖兽血脉融于自身以获得修为精进，甚至可以获得妖兽神通？¤Demon Refining Pill? Fusing the bloodline of a Spirit Beast into oneself to gain cultivation refinement, or even gaining a Spirit Beast's divine ability?
这玄古门倒还真是有些门道，这种事也能办到。¤This Profound Ancient Clan really has some ways of doing things like this.
道友速去，我没有太多时间了。¤Go quickly, Daoist, I don't have much time left.
在法阵的驱动下鼎中鲜血持续的沸腾精炼，更吸引你目光的是空中那一粒黑色的小球。¤The blood in the pot continues to boil and refine under the power of the spell formation, and what attracts your attention even more is the small black ball in the air.
刚一开门，映入眼帘的就是一只只被钉死在墙壁上的妖兽，鲜血汇聚成一条线汇入悬于半空的鼎中。¤As soon as the door is opened, what meets the eye is a Spirit Beast nailed to the wall, its blood pooling in a line into a tripod suspended in mid-air.
此行目的已经达到，我还是趁他回来之前速速离去吧。¤The purpose of the trip has been achieved, so I'd better leave quickly before he returns.
魔神蛊，这玄古门果然有问题。¤Devil God Compulsion, there is really something wrong with this Profound Ancient Sect.
眼前是一个个空荡荡的兽笼，但是地面上的血迹和爪痕书写着这里曾经的炼狱景象。¤In front of them is an empty cage, but the blood and claw marks on the floor write the story of the purgatory it once was.
这地牢种种阵法禁制显然是为了人族修士准备。看来这玄古门也没有面上那么“老实”。¤The dungeon's various formations and prohibitions were obviously prepared for human cultivators. It seems that this Profound Ancient Sect is not as ''honest'' as it seems.
这上面记载了用将蛊虫封入玄古丹的方法。¤This contains the method used to seal the parasite into the Profound Ancient Dan.
架子上空荡荡的，仅有一个玉简吸引着你的目光。¤The shelves are empty, with only a jade slip to catch your eye.
这蛊虫以虫卵的形式假死，然后还能透过外层丹药吸收微弱的灵气存货。¤This parasite faked its death in the form of an egg, and then was still able to absorb weak aura stocks through the outer layer of the Pill.
抛开立场不谈，这玄古门倒还真是有些门道，¤The position aside, this Profound Ancient Sect really has some ways of doing things.
我事先得到了情报，在他们接头时及时带人赶到，抓了个现行。¤I had prior information and arrived with my men in time to catch them in the act as they were meeting.
你发现新的线索了？¤You've found a new clue?
正当你思索之际，那名男子已经转身向着你的方向大步流星的走来，你决定...¤As you ponder this, the man has turned and is striding in your direction and you decide...
你准备怎么处置他？¤What are you going to do with him?
是，大长老。¤Yes, Grand Master.
那血剑宫的长老也就罢了，他应该已经逃回了雍州。但琚运琦却是一个隐患。¤That Blood Sword Palace elder is just as well, he should have already fled back to Yong Province. But Ju Yunqi is a hidden danger.
你希望我来接取这个悬赏么？¤Would you like me to take up the reward?
此事便交给你了。¤The matter is in your hands.
血剑宫在数年前攻打白帝楼失败后，又找上了琚运琦。¤The Blood Sword Palace approached Ju Yunqi again after the failed attack on the White Emperor's House several years ago.
你不动声色的与此人擦肩而过，只觉得他行事作风干练，不怒自威气势逼人，应当实力不俗。¤You pass by this man without moving, but you feel that he has a competent style and is not angry and powerful, so he should be very strong.
他已经上了风雨楼的悬赏，不过以他的实力，一般的杀手可能不是他的对手。¤He has been on the bounty of the Storm House, but with his strength, the average assassin is probably no match for him.
只可惜那琚运琦与血剑宫长老确实实力不俗，我没能留住他们，还是让他们跑了。¤It's just a pity that that Ju Yunqi and the Blood Sword Palace Elders were indeed not very strong, I couldn't keep them and still let them get away.
而且，他做了这么多年风雨楼大长老，对风雨楼暗杀之术非常熟悉。若是躲起来的话，想找到他就已十分困难。¤Moreover, he had been the Grand Elder of the Wind and Rain Tower for so many years, and was very familiar with the assassination techniques of the Wind and Rain Tower. If he were to hide, it would already be very difficult to find him.
你进入望风殿，发现公孙季已经在这里等你了。¤You enter the Hall of Lookout and find that Gongsun Ji is already here waiting for you.
大长老...此人莫非便是琚运琦？¤Grand Elder... Could this person be Ju Yunqi?
你向他行礼，不料此人却像完全没看见一样，从你身旁走过。你只觉得他行事作风干练，不怒自威气势逼人，应当实力不俗。¤You salute him, but the man walks past you as if he hadn't seen you at all. You just think that he is a very powerful man, with a strong and powerful presence.
不仅如此。¤Not only that.
{$daihao}，这次请你来是因为琚运琦之事已经有了新的进展。¤{$daihao}, I asked you to come this time because there has been a new development in the matter of Ju Yunqi.
望风殿前，一名身材高大的黑袍男子似乎正在交代着什么，令你意外的是，他并没有佩戴风雨楼的面具，这也让你得以注意到他的样貌。¤In front of the Hall of Hope, a tall, black-robed man seems to be giving an account of something, and to your surprise, he is not wearing the mask of the Storm House, which allows you to notice his appearance.
琚运琦的赏金不低，你若是感兴趣的话倒是不妨试试。¤Ju Yunqi's bounty is not low, so you might want to give it a try if you are interested.
当你再次醒来时，发现自己已经回到了幽谷竹林之中。你的手边传来阵阵凉意，只见一堆颜色各异的果子被放在你的手边。¤When you wake up again, you find that you have returned to the bamboo forest of the valley. There is a chill from your hand, and you can see a bunch of fruits of different colors on your hand.
咚！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Boom! {vpunch=10,0.5}
你一路追着灰猴跑进了幽谷，但灰猴身姿轻盈，在林间穿梭，把你戏弄一番后，消失在了竹林深处。¤You chased the gray monkey all the way into the valley, but the gray monkey was light and moved through the forest. After teasing you, he disappeared in the depths of the bamboo forest.
你的脑门一痛，好像被什么东西砸了一下，回头一看，只见一只灰猴正冲你做着鬼脸。¤Your forehead hurt, as if you had been hit by something. When you looked back, you saw a gray monkey making a grimace at you.
你一路追着灰猴跑进了幽谷，灰猴身姿轻盈，在林间穿梭，你运起遁术，紧追不舍。¤You chased the gray monkey all the way into the glen. The gray monkey was light and shuffled through the woods. You picked up the escape technique and chased you.
吱吱吱吱¤Squeaking
是那只灰猴放在你身边的么？你扭头四处张望，但灰猴早已不见了踪影。¤Is the gray monkey next to you? You turned your head and looked around, but the gray monkey was long gone.
眼看就要追上灰猴，突然，一股恶心欲吐的感觉从体内泛起，你止住身形，朝四周望去，只见眼前有一寒潭，灰猴正跌落在潭边，面露痛苦之色，似乎在向你求救。¤You are about to catch up with the gray monkey. Suddenly, a feeling of nausea rises from your body. You stop your body and look around. You can see a cold pool in front of you. The gray monkey is falling on the edge of the pool. It looks painful and seems to be asking you for help.
好你个畜生...有种你下来！¤Well, you beast... You can come down here!
无知畜生，犯不着和它计较。¤Ignorant beast, can't care about it.
你强忍住不适，将小猴抱离寒潭，随后你也头痛欲裂，昏睡过去。¤You held back the discomfort and carried the little monkey away from the cold lake, and then you also had a splitting headache and fell asleep.
此地魔气肆溢，必有古怪，不可久留。¤This place is full of evil spirits, there must be weirdness, not for long.
灰猴朝你放声大笑，随后转身一跃，逃进了幽谷深处。¤The gray monkey laughed at you, then turned around and jumped into the depths of the valley.
这不会是当年我和倪兄在这里砍断的那条根须吧...¤This can't be the same root that Brother Ni and I cut off here back then...
一条看上去已经枯死很久的干瘪根须横亘于此。¤A long dead and dried out looking root stretches across the area.
就算只是元婴期妖兽的骸骨，其上灵力也可存留数百年，何况是这神树的根须。¤Even if it is just the skeleton of a YuanYing stage Spirit Beast, the spiritual energy on it can survive for hundreds of years, not to mention the root of this divine tree.
奇怪。¤Strange.
难道是...被它自己吸干的？¤Could it have been... sucked dry by itself?
说着，你一个火球术砸向了颜老怪的洞府。¤With that, you smash a fireball spell into Old Monster Yan's cave.
颜老怪所用的功法太过阴毒，若是传出去，恐怕又有不知多少无辜百姓为此丧命。¤The technique used by Old Monster Yan is so insidious that if word gets out, I am afraid that many innocent people will die for it.
不如先四处云游，广交好友。八千里路云和月，等都见识过再来定论，也未尝不可。¤Why don't you travel around and make friends first? We can see the clouds and the moon for 8,000 miles before we come to a conclusion.
你大概能体会到杜老二的处境与心情了，但又该如何劝说他为好？你陷入了思考。¤You can probably appreciate the situation and feelings of Du Lao Er, but how should you persuade him? You are stuck in thought.
事毕。再回禾山派，此地已是一片狼藉。除了坐在废墟上的杜老二，再无半个身影。¤It's over. When I returned to the Wo Shan School, the place was already in a mess. Apart from Du Lao Er, who was sitting on the ruins, there was no one left.
他摆弄了一番角落里的鬼像，石墙上便赫然出现了一个暗格。¤When he fiddled with the ghostly statue in the corner, a hidden compartment appeared in the stone wall.
这是什么意思？¤What does this mean?
颜老怪我已经除掉了。¤I have gotten rid of the old Yan monster.
…莫非杜兄守候在此便是为了此事？¤...Could it be that this is why Brother Du is waiting here?
我只当是禾山派那群劳什子玩意又回来了，害我白激动一场…¤I just thought it was those Harvest Hill School guys coming back, so I got all excited for nothing...
他死后，我就来这搜寻过一次，不过没找到什么东西，我估摸着可能我神识太低了，所以才没感应到。¤I came here once after his death to search for him, but I didn't find anything, and I reckoned that maybe my soul sense was too low and that's why I didn't sense it.
杜兄？你怎么会在这里？¤Brother Du? What are you doing here?
现在倒好，禾山派散了，我上哪找他们去？¤Now that the Harvest Mountain School is scattered, where can I find them?
就算没有，也总比毫无章法地复仇要好。¤And even if it doesn't, it's better than revenge without any rules.
他低头沉思了许久，但好像也没有思考出什么结论。¤He looked down and pondered for a long time, but didn't seem to come to any conclusion in his thinking.
见到此景，你不禁心生疑惑。¤You can't help but wonder at this sight.
杜老二低头沉思了片刻。¤Du Lao Er looked down and pondered for a moment.
九州大陆，无尽之海，到处都潜藏着各种机缘变故，若不游历一番，眼界未免也太小了点。¤The Nine Provinces and the Endless Sea are full of opportunities and changes, so if you don't travel a bit, your horizons will be too small.
原来是麻兄…我只是碰巧路过此地。禾山派既已然覆灭，麻兄何故来此？¤So it's Brother Ma...I just happened to be passing by. Since the Wo Shan Sect has been destroyed, why did you come here?
怎的，你不走难道是想等我走了独吞宝物？¤Why, are you not leaving because you want to wait for me to leave and take the treasure?
杜老二？莫要以为结丹了我们就怕你，等首领从山谷回来，便有你好果子吃。¤Du Lao Er? Don't think we are afraid of you just because you have attained Pill. When the chief returns from the valley, you will be in for a treat.
那，难道这仇就这么算了？¤So, is this revenge just going to go away?
可是，不去复仇的话，我又该去哪？¤But if I don't go for revenge, then where do I go?
以后你就跟着我办事儿吧。\n¤In the future, you will follow me to do things. \n
不然，就算财侣法地皆圆满，身死道消之后也只能化作尘埃。¤Otherwise, even if one's fortune is complete, one will be reduced to dust after one's death.
颜老怪？此事从何说起？¤Yan Laoqi? Where does this begin?
游历？¤Touring?
总之，今天还是多亏了{FirstName}{xiongdi}。¤All in all, it was a good day thanks to {FirstName}{xiongdi}.
杜兄当真不考虑放下仇恨，去寻觅长生之道？¤Is Brother Du really not considering putting aside his hatred and seeking the path to immortality?
但是我从来没有想过要长生，我修炼，就只是为了报仇。¤But I never wanted to live forever; I cultivated just to take revenge.
这沂山派和禾山道势同水火，我还是不要一个人来这里瞎转悠比较好...¤The Yishan School and Heshan Taoism are in the same water and fire, I'd better not come here alone...
我不想知道颜老怪藏了什么，我是认真的。¤I don't want to know what Yan Laoqi is hiding, and I mean it.
听到此言，杜老二的脸色微沉。¤Hearing these words, Du Lao Er's face sank slightly.
要是在从前，沂山派还没覆灭那会儿，有一群心直口快的朋友一起吹水打牙，一同追寻那长生之道，或许还能有趣一些。¤In the old days, before the destruction of the Yishan School, it might have been more fun to have a group of straight-talking friends to blow off steam and pursue the path to immortality together.
你除掉颜老怪便是为了天下苍生着想，此时究竟要不要阻止麻老九？你犹豫了起来。¤You are trying to get rid of Old Monster Yan for the sake of the people of the world, should you stop Ma Laojiu or not? You hesitate.
刚好结丹之后缺一本合适的主修功法，借这个机会，我一定要搞到一本天阶功法！¤It just so happens that I lack a suitable main cultivation technique after my dan formation, so I'll take this opportunity to get a heavenly ranked technique!
你亦然没有经历过这种事，一时竟也说不出话来。¤You, too, have never experienced anything like this, and for a moment you are speechless.
不然呢？我拼死修炼，就是为了能找他们报仇。¤What else? I fought to the death to cultivate so that I could seek revenge on them.
多捞点好处，早点突破才是正事。¤Getting more benefits and breaking through sooner is the right thing to do.
金丹期修士，就算是放在五大派中也是凤毛麟角般的存在，而在禾山道这种小地方，却一下就出现了两个。¤Golden Dan stage cultivators, even in the five great sects, are like a rare species, but in a small place like Wo Shan Tao, two have appeared at once.
麻老九为了制止你进一步破坏洞府，运起功法便向你攻来。¤In order to stop you from further damaging the cave, Ma Laojiu uses his kung fu and attacks you.
唉，看来在禾山派守着也没用，我还是想想别的办法吧…¤Alas, it seems useless to keep watch at the WoS school, I'd better think of another way...
算了，我再想想吧…¤Never mind, I'll think about it...
颜老怪明明已经身死，禾山派已经覆灭，可你仍能感应到此地有金丹修士的气息，这让你提起了警惕。¤Old Monster Yan is obviously dead and the Wo Shan Sect has been destroyed, but you can still sense the aura of a Jindan cultivator here, which makes you raise your guard.
过去的事已经回想过太多，现在大仇得报，倒也没啥了。¤The past has been recalled too often, and now that the revenge has been avenged, there is nothing more to it.
以前我考虑的东西确实太少了，还是得先到处看看才好。¤It's true that I've given too little thought to things before and I still have to look around first.
且慢……¤And slow down ......
猖狂。要是我没记错的话，当年杜家村的事就有你一份吧？¤Rampant. If I remember correctly, you were part of what happened in Du's village back then, weren't you?
金丹之后，我正愁没有一本像样的功法给我修炼，借这个机会，我一定要找到一本天阶功法！¤After the Golden Core, I was worried about not having a decent gong method for me to cultivate, so I'll take this opportunity to find a Heavenly Rank gong method!
此处便交给你了，我去会会那颜老怪。¤I'll leave this to you, and I'll go and meet that old monster Yan.
言罢，麻老九便自顾自地展开神识，一分一毫地仔细搜寻颜老怪的洞府，生怕漏掉了什么隐蔽的机关暗道。¤After speaking, Ma Laojiu took it upon himself to expand his soul sense and carefully searched Old Monster Yan's cave minute by minute, fearing that he had missed some hidden mechanism or secret passage.
你不懂…虽然禾山派散了，但是我心里的恨意却一点都没散。¤You don't understand...although the Wo Shan School has been scattered, the hatred in my heart has not been dispersed at all.
麻老九阴沉着脸，对峙了片刻，随即又笑了出来。¤Ma Laojiu grimaced, confronted for a moment and then laughed again.
但现在我孤身一人，实在是无趣的紧…¤But now I'm all alone and it's really boring...
你收敛气息，一步步向那气息靠近那人。忽然，那人破门而出，向你袭来。¤You gather your breath and step closer to the man with that breath. Suddenly, the man breaks through the door and comes at you.
他随即放出一阵威压，前一秒还嚣张跋扈的禾山派修士，下一秒便吓得脸色惨白，哆嗦不止。¤He then released a burst of pressure, and the cultivators of the Wo Shan School, who were arrogant and domineering one second, were so frightened the next that they turned pale and shivered.
我也理不清…¤I can't make sense of...
你说得对。¤You are right.
那些普通人充其量也就能活一百年，反正最后都会死，你帮他们干嘛？¤At best, those ordinary people will live for a hundred years, and they will die in the end anyway, so why are you helping them?
况且以我这种资质，能结丹就已经是万幸了，长生对我来说太难了。¤Besides, with qualifications like mine, I would be lucky to attain Pill; immortality would be too difficult for me.
杜老二语气极其愤慨。你原本还想告诉他自己除掉颜老怪的事，现在却硬生生地噎了回去。¤Du Lao Er sounded extremely indignant. You had originally wanted to tell him about getting rid of Old Monster Yan himself, but now you choked back stiffly.
也不知道是哪路高手把他做了，倒也给我出了一口恶气，桀桀桀！¤I don't know which of the masters did him in, but it did give me a bite of anger, Jie Jie!
几名筑基期修士见此情形，也纷纷畏缩不前。只有一名筑基巅峰修士壮起胆子叫嚣了起来。¤When several Foundation Establishment cultivators saw this, they also cowered. Only one peak Foundation Establishment cultivator had the guts to call out.
言毕，杜老二转身便要离去。¤After saying this, Du Lao Er turned around and was about to leave.
杜兄不如干脆四处游历一番，转换一下心境，说不定便有了新的目标，复仇这件事便会慢慢淡化。¤Why don't you just travel around a bit, change your state of mind, maybe you'll have a new goal, and the matter of revenge will fade away.
守门的炼气期修士哪里见过这阵仗？扭头就往里跑。几名筑基期修士见此情形，也纷纷畏缩不前。¤The Qi-refining stage cultivator guarding the gate had never seen such a show before. They turned their heads and ran inside. When the few Foundation Establishment cultivators saw this, they also cowered.
道别后，你便不再多想，转身离开了。¤After saying goodbye, you turn away without further thought.
麻老九迅速将功法书与大半藏品收入囊中，并将剩下的东西递给了你。¤Ma Lao Jiu quickly pockets the book of feats and most of the collection and hands you the rest.
我把当年那些人一个个都杀干净的时候，确实是开心的不得了。¤I did have a lot of fun when I killed every one of those people back then.
那些人资质平平，说不定没筑基成功便已身死道消。但杜兄乃是金丹修为，何必为他们放弃大好前程？¤Those who have mediocre qualifications may die before they succeed in building their foundation. But Brother Du is a Jindan practitioner, so why give up a great future for them?
他一副落寞的样子，丝毫没有想象中大仇得报之后的喜悦。¤He had a forlorn look, with none of the joy that one might expect after a great revenge.
你二人又聊到了对旅途的向往与感慨，不觉间已到了该离别的时候。¤You both talked again about your yearnings and feelings for the journey and before you knew it it was time to part ways.
杜兄…可是想到了什么伤心事？¤Brother Du...have you thought of something sad?
这么说的话，杜兄不如将这些问题都抛诸脑后，外出游历一番，如何？¤In that case, why don't you leave all these problems behind and go out for a trip?
桀桀桀，既然{FirstName}{xiongdi}不高兴，那就依你的意思吧。¤Jie Jie Jie, since {FirstName}{xiongdi} is not happy, then let's follow your wishes.
桀桀桀，{xiongdi}莫要说笑了，难道你不想知道颜老怪到底藏了多少宝贝？大不了到时候多分你一些便是。¤The actual number of treasures that old monster Yan has hidden is not something you want to know. The big deal is to share more with you when the time comes.
自然不是。¤Naturally not.
啧啧，本来想看个热闹，没想到把自己给搭进去了。现在你想怎么办？¤Tsk tusk, I wanted to watch the excitement, but I didn't expect to get myself in. Now what do you want to do?
像无头苍蝇一样找他们也不是个办法，还是先到处逛逛，换换心情好了。¤It's not a good idea to look for them like a fly on the wall, so it's better to wander around for a change of mood.
若是碰巧遇见了，杜兄大可以出手，不过若是没有遇见，杜兄也没有必要在他们身上浪费时间。¤If you happen to meet them, Brother Du can make a move, but if you don't, there is no need for Brother Du to waste time on them.
走了约莫十丈远，麻老九停下了脚步。¤After walking about ten feet away, Ma Laojiu stopped in his tracks.
麻老九狐疑地看了你一眼。¤Ma Lao Jiu gives you a suspicious look.
不然，登入仙门者能修至筑基者已不足半数，修至金丹更是十不足一。¤Otherwise, less than half of those who enter the Immortal Gate can reach Foundation Establishment, and less than one in ten can reach Golden Dan.
你不知道，这厮借口说我们只有筑基修为，一直卡脖子，不给我们修炼高阶功法。¤You don't know, this guy pretends that we only have Foundation Establishment cultivation and keeps getting stuck, not giving us the opportunity to cultivate higher level techniques.
是嘛？谢了…¤Is that so? Thanks...
桀桀桀！有了！¤Jie Jie Jie! There you have it!
罢了，{xiongdi}你也不是外人。我来这跟禾山派没啥关系，跟颜老怪倒是关系很大。¤It's just that {xiongdi} you're not an outsider either. I came here to have nothing to do with the Harvest Mountain School, but I do have a lot to do with Old Monster Yan.
我早就说过，跟着大哥混，少不了你的好处，桀桀桀！¤I've said it before, follow big brother and you'll get no less benefits, Jie Jie Jie!
相互告别后，你们便踏上了新的旅程。¤After saying goodbye to each other, you set off on a new journey.
一定，再会。¤Definitely, goodbye.
都金丹了，你怎么还这么天真？¤Why are you still so naive when you've already reached the Golden Core?
虽说这些东西是我找到的，但毕竟见者有份，这些就归你了。¤I may have found these, but after all, those who see them get them, so these are yours.
见此情形你便知道，此处少不了一场腥风血雨。¤When you see this, you know that there is going to be a lot of bloodshed here.
我虽然也恨颜老怪，是他把这些狗屁功法带到禾山来，才有的后来这么多事。¤I hate Old Monster Yan too though, he was the one who brought all these bullshit gong methods to Wo Shan, which led to all the subsequent incidents.
短暂的惊愕后，你隐约觉得杜老二的神情有些失落。¤After a brief moment of shock, you vaguely feel that there is something lost in the look on Du Lao Er's face.
好家伙，是说以前搜罗的灵石都被他拿去干嘛了，原来都藏在这了！¤What a good guy, what did he do with all the spirit stones he had collected in the past, so they were all hidden here!
（这个麻老九看起来在禾山道里有些地位，反正来都来了，正好想想办法从他嘴里套出点消息。）¤(This Ma Laojiu seems to have some status in Heshan Dao, anyway, he is here, just trying to find a way to get some news out of his mouth.)
你这次干的不错，这是大首领给你的赏赐。\n¤You did a good job this time, this is a reward from the big boss.\n
只见暗格中藏着大批灵石丹药，深处还藏有几本功法书。¤Only a large number of spirit stones and pills were hidden in the hidden compartment, and a few books on gongfu were hidden deep inside.
你走吧，就当今天什么都没找到，我不想与你动手。¤Go away and pretend you found nothing today, I don't want to fight with you.
约莫半个时辰过后，麻老九终于有了发现。¤After about half an hour had passed, Ma Laojiu finally made a discovery.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}？怎么会是你？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}? How could it be you?
杜老二摇了摇头。¤Du Lao Er shook his head.
谢了。¤Thanks.
你能结丹，已经属于资质机缘上佳，若不追寻长生之道，岂不是白白糟蹋了这身修为？¤If you don't pursue the path to eternal life, won't you have wasted your cultivation for nothing?
不管怎么说，只有求得长生之道，其他的事情才有价值。¤In any case, only by seeking the way to immortality will anything else be worthwhile.
你刚准备应敌，却发现竟是熟识之人。¤You are just about to meet your enemy when you realise it is someone you know.
你说的对。¤You're right.
只可惜颜老怪不知道被谁杀了，禾山派也散了，不然我非要亲手杀了他们不可。¤It's just a pity that Old Monster Yan was killed by who knows who and the Wo Shan School has scattered, otherwise I would have had to kill them with my own hands.
可开心过后，又觉得心里空荡荡的。¤But after the happiness, I felt empty again.
那你这是…？¤So what are you...?
但只有把那天我看见的人一个个亲手除掉，我才觉得痛快。¤But it only hurts me to get rid of the people I saw that day, one by one, with my own hands.
那我便预祝杜兄旅途顺利了！¤I wish you all the best for your journey!
但长生之道这种东西也太虚无缥缈了，就算真的长生了，也不见得有什么有趣的东西。¤But such things as the Way of Eternal Life are also too nebulous, and even if one does live forever, it doesn't seem to be anything interesting.
那便预祝杜兄旅途顺利了！¤Well, I wish you all the best for your journey!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}？你怎么在这？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}? What are you doing here?
可现在杀光了，之后再去干嘛呢？我从来都没有想过…¤But now that I've killed all of them, what will I do afterwards? I've never thought about...
杜老二停下了脚步，回头看向你。¤Du Lao Er stops in his tracks and looks back at you.
话虽如此，我还是无法容忍这种滥杀无辜的行为。¤Having said that, I cannot condone this indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
你只站在那，并未上前阻止。¤You just stood there and did not come forward to stop it.
从前我修炼的目标非常明确，所以才有强烈的动力。¤Once upon a time I had a very clear goal for my practice, which is why I was so strongly motivated.
杜兄此前一直在禾山、沂山一带活动，最远不过也在宁州之内吧？¤Brother Du had previously been active in the area of Wo Shan and Yishan, and was only as far as Ning Province, right?
你他娘来真的啊？¤Are you fucking serious?
…既然禾山派已然覆灭，何必赶尽杀绝呢？¤...Since the Wo Shan School has already been destroyed, why should they be driven to extinction?
好了，我要先回去琢磨这新功法了，下次有好东西可别忘记大哥我！¤Okay, I'm going to go back to work on this new technique, so don't forget me next time you have something good!
虽然是这么个道理，但我总觉得哪里不对…¤That's true, but I always felt something was wrong...
禾山派已不复存在。告别后，你们便踏上了新的旅程。¤The Harvest School no longer exists. After saying goodbye, you set off on a new journey.
说着，你便运起了功法。麻老九也停止了探查，转身看向你，气氛顿时紧张了起来。¤With that, you run up your kung fu. Ma Laojiu also stops probing and turns to look at you, and the atmosphere suddenly becomes tense.
面对麻老九的这个问题，你一时想不出如何回应。¤Faced with this question from Ma Lao Jiu, you are momentarily unable to think of a response.
收手吧，麻兄。¤Call it quits, Brother Ma.
言罢，麻老九便径直走了出去，但你却留在洞府门口一动不动。¤With these words, Ma Laojiu walked straight out, but you stayed at the entrance of the cave without moving a muscle.
现在我结丹了，就想着再来找找看…事先说好，别的东西也就算了，要是找到了后续功法，你可不准跟我抢！\t¤Now that I've formed my Pill, I thought I'd come back for more...let's say in advance that other things are fine, but if I find a follow-up gongfu, you're not allowed to steal it from me! \t
之前我拼命修炼，只是想有一天能把他们都杀光。¤Before that, I was desperately cultivating just to kill them all one day.
大恩不言谢，我们后会有期！¤No thanks for your kindness, we'll see you later!
他又沉思了片刻。¤He pondered for a few more moments.
……我倒是没有这种疑问，若要我说，修行本就不是为了复仇，而是为了追求长生之道。¤...... I have no such doubts. If you ask me, cultivation is not supposed to be about revenge, but about pursuing the path to immortality.
看着麻老九的背影，你转念一想——若是麻老九找到了那些所谓的后续功法，他会成为第二个颜老怪继续祸害苍生吗？¤Looking at the back of Ma Laojiu, you turn to think - if Ma Laojiu had found those so-called follow-up techniques, would he have become the second Old Monster Yan to continue to plague the people?
空荡荡的？¤Empty?
听说这禾山道的修士都喜欢用人的魂魄来祭炼法器，我还是别在这里逗留了...¤I heard that the cultivators of Heshan Dao like to use human souls to sacrifice refining artifacts, so I'd better not stay here...
后会有期。¤There will be a period later.
（不过这里毕竟是沂山派的主场，想必也留有一些后手。现在还只是一群炼气修为的弟子在小打小闹，也不知会不会有筑基期的高手参战。）¤(But after all, this is the home court of the Yishan faction, and there must be some back players. Right now, it is just a group of disciples who are refining qi and cultivating at a small level, and I don't know if there will be masters in the foundation building stage participating in the battle. )
这段时间大哥和二哥不在门内，你要是有什么事，就直接来找我吧。¤During this time, the eldest brother and the second brother are not in the door, if you have anything, just come to me directly.
你这{xiaozi}，是哪一边的？¤Which side of you {xiaozi} are you from?
我...我是禾山道的！¤I... I'm from Heshan Road!
情急之下，你脱口而出....¤In a hurry, you blurt out...
小{xiongdi}，咱们一起上，给他点教训！¤Little {xiongdi}, let's go together and teach him a lesson!
（这个杜老二看起来在沂山派里有些地位，反正来都来了，正好想想办法从他嘴里套出点消息。）¤(This old man Du seems to have some status in the Yishan school, anyway, he has come, just trying to find a way to get some news out of his mouth.)
桀桀桀桀，不过是个新入门的{xiaozi}罢了，你还当真找到了什么帮手？¤Jie Jie Jie Jie, it's just a newcomer {xiaozi}, what help did you really find?
哈哈哈，小{xiongdi}，今天多谢你出手相助，以后你就算我们沂山派的人了。¤Hahaha, little {xiongdi}, thank you for your help today. From now on, you will be a member of the Yishan School.
他奶奶的，你们两个就是一起上，我又何惧。¤His grandma's, you two are going together, so I'm so afraid.
嘿，我们倒是没在门派内见过，你这{xiaozi}是新来的吧？¤Hey, we haven't seen it in the martial arts, you {xiaozi} are new here, right?
你还没走近沂山派的山寨，兵器法术相交之声便已传来，远远望去，只见数十个沂山派与禾山道的修士们已经战作一团，打的不可开交。¤Before you approached the Yishan Sect's cottage, the sound of weapons and spells intersecting has already been heard. Looking from a distance, I saw dozens of Yishan Sect and Heshan Taoist cultivators who had already fought and formed a battle. Hand over.
我...我是沂山派的！¤I... I'm from Yishan School!
他奶奶的，这里怎么还藏了一个，你莫不是故意引我来这里？¤His grandma, why is there one hidden here? Didn't you deliberately bring me here?
（这禾山道的修士，一出手便是各种血祭搜魂的邪道法门，同阶的修士还真不是他们的对手。）¤(This cultivator of Heshan Dao, as soon as he shot it, was the evil way of searching for souls with various blood sacrifices. The cultivators of the same rank are really not their opponents.)
那禾山道的修士挥舞手中的巨幡，一层血色的护罩轻易便将他面前的火弹挡住。你却避无可避，其中一颗火弹“轰”的一声砸在树干上，整棵树都烧了起来。¤The cultivator of Heshan Road waved the giant banner in his hand, and a blood-colored shield easily blocked the Fire Bombs in front of him. But you can't avoid it, one of the Fire Bombs hit the trunk with a boom. The whole tree burned up.
沂山派的修士可都不是什么善茬...我还是赶紧离开，别被他们发现了...¤The cultivators of the Yishan Sect are not good stubborns...I still leave quickly, don't let them find out...
桀桀桀桀，我也不管你是真是假，只要你这回立了功，回去我自当禀报寨主，少不了你的好处。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie, I don't care if you are true or not. As long as you have done a good job this time, I will report to the village master when I go back. Your benefit is indispensable.
我...我只是路过的¤I... I just passed by
你正看着热闹，没想到混战之中，有两名修士竟一路追打到了附近。只见那沂山派的修士连捏法决，凭空聚起数个火弹向你这里飞来。¤You are watching the excitement. Unexpectedly, in the melee, two cultivators chased them all the way to the vicinity. I saw that the cultivators of the Yishan faction squeezed the law, and gathered several Fire Bombs out of thin air to fly towards you.
（沂山派和禾山道可都不是什么善茬，我还是别淌这趟混水了。）¤(Yishan School and Heshan Road are not good stubbles, I still don't run into this muddled water.)
沂山派和禾山道的人果然打起来了...也不知道是什么宝物能让他们这样兴师动众。¤The people of Yishan School and Heshan Road really fought...I don't know what treasure can make them so invigorating.
你找到一棵大树，捏了一个敛气的法决，纵身一跃，便躲在树上看起戏来。¤You found a big tree, squeezed a dhamma, jumped, and hid in the tree and watched the show.
这浑水可不好趟，你可得考虑清楚咯。¤This muddy water is not easy, you have to think about it.
他奶奶的，这儿是你该来的地方么，赶紧给老子滚蛋，不然连你一块儿收拾。¤His grandma, is this the place you should come to? Hurry up and get rid of Lao Tzu, or you will clean up with you.
你只能纵身从树上跳下，那两名修士显然没有料到这里会突然蹦出个人来，停止了争斗，一齐看向你。¤You can only jump down from the tree. The two cultivators obviously didn't expect that someone would suddenly pop out from here, stop fighting, and look at you together.
“你真的确定这东西有市场吗......”¤Are you really sure there is a market for this thing...
这小的就不知道了。¤I don't know this little one.
这位仙师来得正好！你说甜丹药好还是咸丹药好？¤This immortal master came just right! Do you think sweet pill or salty pill is better?
若说什么地方能寻得这天蝉灵叶，大抵也只有那仙山了。¤If there is any place where you can find the Skyscada Leaf, there is probably only at that celestial mountain.
打听天蝉灵叶的可是倪家之人？¤Was the one who was acquiring about the Skyscada Leaf from the Ni family?
新品丹药就应该做甜的！¤The new product pill should be made sweet!
谢过仙师帮忙，这颗试作品就送给你，届时出了新丹，还请仙师一定多多捧场！¤Thanks to the immortal master for his help, this trial work will be given to you, and a new pill will be released at that time, and the immortal master will definitely join us!
“有消息就是好事，倪府神通广大，说不定能够打听到那岱舆山的消息。我还是先回倪府，把这件事说给倪兄吧。”¤If there is news, it is a good thing. Ni Mansion's magical powers are so great, you might be able to inquire about Dai Yushan's news. I'd better go back to Ni Mansion first and tell Brother Ni about this matter.
仙长真是消息灵通，不过这天蝉灵叶素来难求，我们也毫无头绪。¤The Vernerable Celestial is really well-informed, but the Skyscada Leaf has always been difficult to locate, and we also don't have any information.
不知这仙山方位几何？¤I don't know the location of this fairy mountain?
听见没有！甜的甜的就是甜的！甜才是天下第一！¤Have you heard! Sweet is sweet! Sweet is the best in the world!
这......¤This......
“丹药还分甜味咸味，这灵药堂小厮当真奇思妙想......”¤Pills are also sweet and salty, this Spirit Herb Hall servant is really a whimsical idea...
离得老远你就听见二人的争执，看样子是为新研发的丹方而争吵。¤You heard the quarrel between the two of them far away. It seems to be a quarrel over the newly developed prescription.
你胡说！明明咸味更合适！¤You nonsense! Obviously salty taste is more appropriate!
听见没有！只有咸味才人见人爱一统众口！¤Have you heard it! Only the salty taste is everyone's favorite!
仙长，何事？¤Xianchang, what's the matter?
奔波了几日才得一点缥缈的消息，传闻海上有处岱舆山，山中药谷灵气充盈，百草丰茂。¤It took a few days to get a little murky news. Rumor has it that there is Daiyu Mountain on the sea, the valley of mountain herbs is full of spirit, and the herbs are luxuriant.
奇也怪也，近几日打听这稀奇灵药的突然多了起来，往日知晓这奇药的人都没几个。¤Weird and weird. In the past few days, there has been a sudden increase in the number of people asking about this strange medicine. Few people knew about this strange medicine in the past.
逸风府人去楼空，驻守在门前的护卫也都不知所踪。¤The Yifeng Mansion is empty, and the guards stationed at the door are all missing.
这逸风府里都是宁王的人，我还是不要再去了...¤This Yifeng Mansion is full of Ning Wang's people, I'd better not go there anymore...
还是先去{color=#d0380a}宁王府{/color}看看吧...¤Let's go to {color=#d0380a}Ning Wang's residence{/color} first...
此地无人经营，擂台已积了厚厚的灰。¤This place is not operated, the ring has accumulated a thick ash.
现下斗法台并无比试，街上空荡荡的。¤Now there is no competition in the fighting stage, the street is empty.
这里好似被人翻修过，焕然一新的擂台上几名修士正在斗法比试。¤The place seems to have been renovated, a new ring on a few cultivators are fighting competitions.
抱歉仙长，此乃宁王居所，闲杂人等不得入内¤Sorry, this is the residence of the King of Ning, no strangers are allowed to enter!
原本富丽堂皇的宁王府不知为何衰败起来，朱红的大门贴满了封条。从已经破旧不堪的纸张看来，这府邸似乎被封已久。¤The original magnificent Ning Wang Mansion somehow decayed, the vermilion red door is plastered with seals. From the worn out paper, it seems that the residence has been sealed for a long time.
这宁王府并不简单，我还是不要再回去了...¤This Ning Wang Mansion is not simple, I better not go back...
此乃宁王居所，闲杂人等不得入内。¤This is the residence of the King of Ning, no idle people are allowed to enter.
宁王府内可能藏着魔修，该怎么做才能避免打草惊蛇呢...?{w}{w=0.5}¤There could be evil cultivators in the Ning King Manor, what should I do to avoid alerting them...? {w}{w=0.5}
你贵为王府供奉，自然可以随意出入王府不受限制，一路上所有见到你的婢女与管事都向你行礼。¤You are a Guest Elder of the kingdom, so naturally you can enter and leave the kingdom at will without restriction, and all the maidservants and stewards who see you on the way salute you.
你刚想入府，便被门口的门房拦了下来...¤You just want to enter the house, you were stopped by the gatekeeper...
你心神合一，探查着宁王府内的情况，一道略有熟悉的声音传入你的脑海。¤You united your mind and explored the situation inside the Ning Wang Mansion, and a slightly familiar voice came into your mind.
你心神合一，慢慢将神识探入王府。谁知还没等你听到什么动静，就觉得一阵剧痛，识海仿佛被另一股力量所刺穿！¤You unite your mind and slowly probe your soul sense into the king's palace. Who knows that before you can hear any movement, you feel a sharp pain, as if your sea of consciousness has been pierced by another force!
显然，王府内有其他的修士发现了你，你闷哼一身，顾不得太多，转身便狼狈的逃跑了...¤Obviously, there are other cultivators in the king's house found you, you grunted, do not care too much, turned around and ran away in a mess...
你未曾学习过敛息的法门，才刚一跳上墙头，就被宁王府内的人发现了，只能狼狈地扭头就跑...¤You hadn't learned the technique of astringent breath, and as soon as you jumped on the wall, you were discovered by the people in the Ning Palace, so you could only turn around and run in a mess...
熟悉的男声：哼！都怪那人坏我好事，定要找个机会暗中将他除去！¤Familiar male voice: Humph! I'll find a chance to get rid of him secretly!
这个声音......他就是那里在斗法台上与我比试的金大勇！¤This voice ...... He is the Jin Dayong who competed with me there on the stage!
你收敛起息悄悄潜入宁王府，一道略有熟悉的声音从你耳边传来。¤You gathered your breath to quietly sneak into the Ning Wang Mansion, a slightly familiar voice came from your ears.
本就为荣华富贵而来，却被他抢了风头害我不能专美于前，实在气煞我也！¤I came here for the glory and wealth, but he stole the limelight and prevented me from being able to enjoy the beauty of the front, which really pissed me off!
原来他还在为斗法台上的比试耿耿于怀...表面上恭维与我，暗地里却想置我于死地，着实令人不齿。¤So he is still upset about the competition on the stage... On the surface to compliment me, but secretly want to kill me, really disgraceful.
不过看来他并不是魔修...这点倒是错怪他了。¤But it seems that he is not a evil cultivator... This is wrong to blame him.
你正感慨此行恐怕空手而返时，神识敏锐地捕捉到一丝奇异的波动，隔壁房间里传来另一段令你好奇的对话。¤You were lamenting that you might return empty-handed from this trip when your soul sense keenly caught a strange fluctuation, and another conversation came from the next room that made you curious.
不如去中草阁走上一番，看看有没有什么方便我行事的草药。到时候......¤Why not go up to the Chinese herb pavilion and see if there are any herbs that are convenient for me to act. When the time comes ......
哼，王府内不好动手，正等着你出宁王府呢！¤Hmph, it's not good to make a move inside the royal residence, just waiting for you to get out of the Ning Wang Mansion!
我们在听雨阁相识的。¤We met after listening to Yuge.
我问，你答。¤I ask, you answer.
忽然四周黑雾四散而开，好像什么都没有发生一样。¤Suddenly, the black mist spread out, as if nothing happened.
他跟你说了什么？¤What did he tell you?
我在武陵城英杰会小胜一招，夺得魁首他邀请我来的。¤I have a small win in Wuling City Yingjie, and he invited me to win the first place.
就是普通闲聊，没什么的。¤It's just ordinary small talk, it's nothing.
你将你和公孙季相聚的场景，向他复述一遍。¤You retell the scene where you and Gongsun Ji meet.
...前辈，请讲。¤...Senior, please speak.
（老头，你看出门道了吗？这来者不善啊。）¤(Old man, do you see the doorway? This one is not good.)
公孙季（公孙道友，为求自保不要怪我啊。）¤Gongsun Ji (friend Gongsun, don't blame me for self-protection.)
怎么认识的？¤How did you meet?
这是一道似男似女的声音，在四周响起，虚虚实实时有时无，你甚至不能分辨他的方向。¤This is a voice that resembles a man and a woman, resounding all around, there is nothing in reality, and you can't even tell his direction.
对方应该精通隐匿暗杀之道的金丹修士，不然纵使我仅剩一缕残魂，也断不可能没有一点察觉。¤The other party should be a golden core cultivator who is proficient in concealed assassination. Otherwise, even if I only have a ray of remnant soul, it is impossible to be unconscious.
忽然四周黑雾弥漫，鬼哭狼嚎，你感受到一股近乎凝实的杀气锁定了你。¤Suddenly, the surrounding black fog is filled, and the ghosts are crying and howling, you feel a nearly solid murderous intent locking you.
刚刚进去见了谁？¤Who did you see when you went in?
道友里边儿请——¤Please come inside...
公孙私宅不接待无邀请的宾客，阁下请回吧。¤The private residence of Gongsun does not receive uninvited guests, your Excellency please go back.
少主已在观花榭等候多时，阁下沿着此路行至尽头便到了。¤The young master has been waiting for a long time in the flower viewing pavilion, you will arrive at the end of this road.
小厮听了你的话面露笑意，有些轻快地回答你的疑问。¤The boy smiles at your words and answers your question somewhat briskly.
阁下不用担心迷路，府上也并不提防阁下行些不轨之事，至于原因您入府便知。¤You do not have to worry about getting lost, the house does not prevent you from doing something untoward, and you will know why when you enter the house.
你不与我同去吗？¤Are you not coming with me?
你以敛息术隐去神识波动后，寻得一处阵法薄弱的侧门，闪身而入。¤After you use the Breath Conditioning Technique to hide the fluctuations of your consciousness, you find a side door with a weak formation and dodge in.
等待时，你发现公孙府的守卫极少，估摸着是公孙家仗着阵法之能省了些人力。不如...¤While waiting, you found that there were very few guards in the Gongsun Mansion. It was estimated that the Gongsun Family had saved some manpower by virtue of the formation. Rather than...
这...前辈请稍等。¤This... Seniors, please wait a moment.
听闻公孙家的极品盈手露甚是难得，想上门讨要一坛。¤I heard that the Gongsun family's very rare surplus hand dew, want to come to the door to ask for a jar.
不知前辈来我公孙府何事？¤I don't know why the senior came to my Gongsun Mansion?
前辈请随我来，少主已在大殿等候。¤Senior, please come with me, the young master is already waiting in the hall.
片刻后，刚才离开的修士急匆匆地赶回门口。¤After a while, the cultivator who had just left hurried back to the door.
还好，赶在前往通报的修士之前回到此处。¤Fortunately, come back here before the cultivator who went to the report.
你找了个阵法薄弱的侧门准备潜入，却感觉一直有神识锁定着自己，只得悻悻地回到正门。¤You found a side door with a weak formation to sneak in, but you felt that your consciousness was locked on you all the time, so you had to go back to the main door angrily.
你隐去神识波动后，寻得一处阵法薄弱的侧门，闪身而入。¤After you hide the fluctuation of your consciousness, you find a side door with a weak formation and dodge in.
前辈可是已完成对叛徒的追杀？¤Has the senior already completed the hunt for the traitor?
你要找我也不必这样吧，现在可是全宁州都在传我们星宫出了叛徒。若想平息这波谣言可得费不少功夫。¤You don't have to do this if you want to find me, but now all Ning Province is saying that there are traitors in our star palace. It will take a lot of work to quell this wave of rumors.
这符也太突然了，连句再见都没说上，也不知道倪兄顺利逃走了没有......¤This symbol is too sudden, I didn't even say goodbye, and I don't know if Brother Ni escaped smoothly...
呵呵，这点阁下无需顾虑。在下的工作便是在交易会举办期间，带人前往秘市。¤Hehe, you don't need to worry about this. The next job is to take people to the secret city during the fair.
或者，我只要把你挂在天星城头三个月，同时贴一条横幅，上书“我再也不敢造谣了”，说不定能省去不少麻烦嘻嘻。¤Or, I only need to hang you in Skystar City for the first three months, and at the same time put up a banner saying I will never dare to spread rumors again, maybe I can save a lot of trouble hehe.
眼下这天星城里就有一场秘市交易会要开始了，阁下若是信得过的话，在下可以作为你的推荐人，带你去参加这次的交易会。¤At the moment, there is a secret market fair in Tianxing City. If you can trust it, you can be your recommender and take you to this fair.
面对这种情况，你作为始作俑者之一也只能暗自苦笑，希望在达到原来目标的同时不要太超出掌控。¤Faced with this situation, as one of the initiators, you can only smile to yourself, hoping that you will not be too out of control while achieving the original goal.
为什么找上我？¤Why did you find me?
阁下可曾听说过秘市？¤Have you ever heard of the secret market?
你听说了么，云汐城那边最近好像又有修习采补之术的邪修了。¤Have you heard that there seems to be another evil cultivator in Yunxi City who is cultivating the technique of harvesting and nourishing recently.
嘿嘿，这次可不一样，听说原本就是个金丹后期的邪修，最近靠着采补秘术突破到了元婴期，你往后出城可要小心些。¤Hehe, this time is different. I heard that he was originally an evil cultivator in the late stage of Jindan. He recently broke through to the Nascent Soul stage with the secret technique of harvesting and replenishing. You should be careful when you go out of the city.
在下吴武凯，就住在这天星城坊市的附近，对这里很是熟悉。若是阁下想在这里买到些特殊的宝贝的话，在下也许可以帮得上忙。¤In Xia Wu Wukai, I live near the city of Tianxing City, and I am familiar with it. If you want to buy some special treasures here, Xia Xia may be able to help.
啊，光顾着和{FirstName}{xiongdi}闲聊险些忘了正事，我们这便进入林府吧。¤Ah, light and {FirstName}{xiongdi} gossip almost forgot the business, we will enter the Lin House this time.
果然是星铃儿，而且不出所料的，她一开口满满的全是埋怨。¤It was indeed Xing Ling'er, and as expected, she was full of complaints when she opened her mouth.
倒也不是没有可能，毕竟对于修士来说年龄并不重要，只是与一个陷入瓶颈还寿元无多的长老结为道侣，不像是我所熟识的林家二小姐的作风。¤It's not impossible, after all, for Vagrant Cultivators age does not matter, just with a bottleneck in the elders still life expectancy is not like the style of the second young lady of the Lin family that I know.
当代宫主虽很少出面，但对林家也是照顾有加。所以丹阳子前辈在星宫中的地位可不一般。¤Although the current palace master rarely appear, but the Lin family is also cared for. So Danyangzi senior in the Star Palace's status is not ordinary.
咳，星道友稍安勿躁...变成这个局面我也是没想到...¤Cough, fellow Daoist Star, don't be impatient... I didn't expect this situation to happen...
这修士之间争斗也是常有发生，有争斗自然就会得到一些见不得光的，这些东西若是去坊市堂而皇之的售卖，难免会遇上一些麻烦，所以才有了这种隐蔽的交易形式。¤Fights between cultivators often occur. If there is a fight, you will naturally get some unseen things. If these things are sold in the market, it will inevitably encounter some troubles. That's why there is this hidden form of transaction.
而且啊，我听说，这人可是从天星城...¤And ah, I heard that this person is from Tianxing City...
你见星铃儿默认了，便领着她前往林府。¤Seeing that Xing Linger acquiesced, you led her to the Lin Mansion.
这秘市之中的交易抽水很大，所以物价也比一般坊市要贵上不少。若是阁下在秘市中买了什么东西，我自然也能得到一笔不错的报酬。¤The trading margins in this secret market are very large, so the prices are much more expensive than the general market. If you buy something in the secret market, I will naturally get a good payment.
这秘市的存在可能很多人都知道，但想要参加又是另外一回事了。毕竟秘市里交易的东西虽然都是外面难得一见的精品，但大多来路有些问题，所以这交易的时间和场所也时常变化。¤The existence of this secret city may be known to many people, but wanting to participate is another matter. After all, although the things traded in the secret city are rare boutiques outside, most of them have some problems in the way of origin. The time and place of transactions also change from time to time.
这有什么奇怪的，虽然没见过高境界的这类邪修，但一直是野火烧不尽。也不知他们功法哪来的。¤What's strange about this, although I have never seen such a high-level evil cultivator, it has always been wildfire. I don't know where they come from.
环顾四周，倪旭欣已不在身边，大概是传送符将你们二人分别送到了不同的地方。¤Looking around, Ni XuXin is no longer around. It is probably the teleporter that sent the two of you to different places.
你正思考着，一道黑影不知从何处出现在身后。¤As you were thinking, a dark shadow appeared behind you from nowhere.
什么事？¤what's up?
{xiongdi}可知大名鼎鼎的星宫双圣？这两位前辈便是星宫的创始人，而林家便是双圣中广微仙子的家族。所以林家家主丹阳子前辈，虽不是广微仙子的嫡系，但也是关系较近的后辈。¤The two saints of the famous Star Palace are known to the {xiongdi}. These two seniors are the founders of the Star Palace, and the Lin family is the family of the double saints, the Guangwei Immortal. So the Lin family head Danyangzi seniors, although not the direct lineage of the Guangwei immortal, but also the closer relationship of the descendants.
哦？难道还是真的不成？我可是对采补之术深恶痛绝，若是敢骗我，可有你受的。¤Oh? Is it still really impossible? I hate the technique of picking and replenishing. If you dare to lie to me, you will suffer.
秘市？¤Secret City?
但还真不一定是谣传。¤But it's not necessarily a rumor.
也不知林沐心用了什么方法，不出几日，宁州便是四处谣传滥用采补功法的邪修重现，一时间宁州的金丹期及以下修士皆是人人自危，影响之深俨然已成燎原之势，远超你的预料。¤I don't know what method Lin Muxin used. Within a few days, the evil cultivators who were rumored to abuse the harvesting and nourishing exercises reappeared in Ning Province. For a time, the cultivators of the Jindan period and below in Ning Province were all in danger and affected them. Shen seems to have become a prairie prairie, far beyond your expectations.
阁下，请留步。¤Sir, please stay.
元婴期...但他都元婴期了，也不会对我这种低阶修士感兴趣了吧？¤Nascent Soul Stage... But he's already in the Nascent Soul Stage, so he won't be interested in a low-level cultivator like me, right?
此等大事自然不会当做儿戏。星道友不如与我回到林家，让林沐心姑娘和你详细说说。¤Such major events are naturally not child's play. Fellow Daoist Xing, why don't you go back to Lin's house with me and let Miss Lin Muxin tell you in detail.
可不是你想的那样。以前都说修习采补秘术突破到筑基虽然快，但要到金丹就已是难上加难。现在却有人能籍此修炼到元婴境，你觉得那些资质不佳的邪修会怎么想？¤Not what you think. It was said in the past that although it is fast to cultivate the secret technique of harvesting and replenishment to break through to foundation building, it is even more difficult to reach the golden core. Now there are people who can use this to cultivate to the Nascent Soul Realm. What do you think those evil cultivators with poor aptitude will think?
啊...那不是...¤Ah...that's not...
（看来暂时是出不去了，还是回客栈休息吧。）¤（It seems there is no way out for the time being, it is better to go back to the inn to rest.）
当然，也包括出现在他们视野内的你。¤Of course, including the appearance of you in their view.
但能让那些修士不敢随意靠近城门的并不是这些手持武器的凡人，而是在旁边看似闲聊的数位修士——他们正用神识监控附近的一切。¤But it was not the mortals with weapons who dared to approach the gates, but several Vagrant Cultivators who appeared to be chatting nearby - they were monitoring everything nearby with their soul sense.
城门处，守门卫兵正手持武器于此戒严，一副请勿靠近的样子，周遭也确是几无人迹。¤At the gates, the guards are holding weapons and are on guard, with a do-not-approach look, and there are indeed no signs of anyone around.
（看来暂时是出不去了，还是去别处看看吧。）¤（It seems that there is no way to get out for the time being, so let's go elsewhere.
来到客栈，掌柜果然已是受林府之命给你准备了一间灵气充裕的上房。¤When you arrive at the inn, the innkeeper has prepared a room with abundant aura for you by the order of the Lin family.
行至传送阵前，却发现原本因大家都守序排队的传送阵前如今是熙攘一片，有询问何故封闭传送阵的，有起哄要求开启阵法的，更是有咒骂林家和星宫的，纷扰至极，好不热闹。¤When they arrived at the transmission array, they found that the original transmission array, which was lined up in order, was now bustling with people asking why it was closed, asking for the opening of the array, and even cursing the Lin family and the Star Palace, which was very disturbing and lively.
但在场的大抵是练气和筑基境修士，对于星宫与林家来说不过是蜉蝣而已，翻不起什么大浪。于是在林家的“安抚”之下，也就慢慢散去了。¤But the presence of most of the Qi and Foundation realm Vagrant Cultivators, for the Star Palace and the Lin family is just a mayfly, can not make any big waves. So under the appeasement of the Lin family, they slowly dispersed.
（看来传送阵暂时是不会开启了，还是去别处看看吧。）¤（It seems that the transmission array will not be opened for the time being, so let's go elsewhere.
但...心儿自英杰会后一直在外游历，不在府中。若道友无其他要事，不妨入府品茶赏花。¤But... I've been traveling since the Yingjie meeting and I'm not in the house. If you do not have other important matters, you may want to enter the house to enjoy tea and flowers.
此乃私人住宅，仙长若无要事恕不接见。¤This is a private residence, so I'm sorry if you don't have any important business.
林府现下无暇接待宾客，还请移步{color=#d0380a}客栈{/color}小憩几日。¤The Lin House has no time to receive guests, so please move to the {color=#d0380a} inn {/color} for a few days.
英杰会上道友与心儿不分上下，她还特意向我提起过呢。¤The Daoist friend at the Yingjie meeting was indistinguishable from Xin'er, and she made a point of mentioning it to me.
阁下难道是{FirstName}{LastName}道友？¤You are {FirstName}{LastName} a fellow Daoist?
道友听说过我？¤You've heard of me?
有事倒也说不上，只是路过天星城，顺道来拜访林沐心道友而已。¤I can't say that I have anything to do with it, but I was just passing through the Heavenly Star City and came by to visit Daoist friend Lin MuXin.
正是，道友可是有事访问林府？¤I'm just stopping by to visit Lin MuXin.
请问这里可是林府？¤Is this the Lin Mansion?
道友请随我来。¤Please come with me.
既是如此，祝道友诸事顺意。待心儿回来后，我会告诉她道友曾来拜访。¤In that case, I wish you all the best. When Xin'er returns, I will tell her that you have come to visit.
之前英杰会上心儿被道友击败后，她可是对道友的实力赞不绝口呢。¤After Xin'er was defeated by Daoist at the Yingjie meeting, she was very complimentary about Daoist's strength.
况且那林家家主也是元婴期修为，再加上身份特殊，对于星宫，还是有很强的影响力的。¤Besides, that Lin family head is also a YuanYing stage cultivation, plus a special identity, for the Star Palace, still have a strong influence.
若说是想双修谋求突破吧，找个境界差不多的岂不是更好？要说用什么采补一类的邪术魔功，也不应该找上林家。以星宫和林家的关系，肯定不会为了区区金丹长老牺牲一个林二小姐的。¤If you want to seek a breakthrough in dual cultivation, wouldn't it be better to find a similar realm? To say what to use a kind of tonic evil magic, should not find the Lin family. The relationship between the Star Palace and the Lin family, certainly not for the sake of a district Jindan elders sacrifice a second Miss Lin.
蹊跷倒说不上，但林沐心不过是筑基期修为，星宫的老家伙却是金丹后期，甚至离寿元耗尽也就二三十年了。¤I can't say that it's strange, but Lin MuXin is just a Foundation Stage Vagrant Cultivator, and the Patriarch of the Star Palace is a late Jindan stage, even 20 to 30 years before his life expectancy runs out.
倪兄为何一副不太看好的样子？难道这桩事有什么蹊跷？¤Why does Brother Ni look like he's not too optimistic? Is there something fishy about this pile?
这林家二小姐可是双灵根，林家的家主本来是把她当做家族的未来，打算全力培养的。不知怎么的，现在居然想让林沐心和星宫长老修为道侣。¤This Lin family's second young lady is a double spiritual root, the Lin family's family head originally regarded her as the family's future, intended to train with all their might. Somehow, now he actually wants Lin MuXin and the Star Palace elders to cultivate as a Dao couple.
听说此次要联姻的是林府的二小姐和那星宫的一位金丹期长老，叫什么肾...不对，应该是空虚，哦不，是冲虚，对！冲虚散人。¤I heard that this time to marry the second young lady of the Lin House and that the Star Palace of a Golden Dan stage elders, called what kidney ... No, it should be empty void, oh no, it's punching void, yes! Chongxu scattered people.
不早，不早，我其实也才到天星城哈哈。先给{FirstName}{xiongdi}介绍一下这次的结侣典礼吧。¤Not too early, not too early, I actually just arrived in Tianxing City haha. Let's first give {FirstName}{xiongdi} an introduction to this couple bonding ceremony.
倪兄来的真早。¤Brother Ni has come really early.
王前辈这是怎么了？平时不都是一副盛气凌人的样子么，就连在大长老面前也没见他收敛多少。¤Senior Wang, what happened? Isn't it usually a domineering look, even in front of the elders, I didn't see him restraining much.
王登一改之前毕恭毕敬的样子，刷的一下便是面色惨白。神态转变之快，让退在一边的两位守门弟子也是一惊，乃至忍不住小声讨论起来。¤Wang Deng changed his respectful appearance before, and his face turned pale after a brush. The rapid change in demeanor surprised the two gatekeeper disciples who had retreated to the side, and even couldn't help but discuss in a low voice.
{vpunch=10,0.5}你！你是当年那个！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}You! You are the one back then!
哟，这不是王登王小友嘛，几十年不见，还在当看门弟子呢？¤Yo, isn't this Wang Deng Xiaoyou Wang, who hasn't seen him for decades, is he still a janitor?
眼前金丹修士竟是当初林家花园的那个手下败将，你不由得嘴角勾起一丝戏谑。¤In front of you, Jindan cultivator is actually the defeated general in the Lin Family Garden. You can't help but tease.
晚辈王登见过前辈，请问前辈来星宫有何贵干？¤The junior Wang Deng has seen the senior, what is the senior doing in the Star Palace?
来到星宫门口后，你感受数道神识探查扫过，但尽皆被你的身上的林家秘宝屏蔽了去。立时，守门弟子都退到一边，另有一个金丹修士从星宫内迎了出来。¤After arriving at the gate of the Star Palace, you felt that several soul senses swept through, but all of them were blocked by the Lin family secret treasure on your body. Immediately, the gatekeepers all stepped aside, and another Jindan cultivator greeted him from the Star Palace.
既然上次的教训还不够，我今天就再让你长长记性！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Since the last lesson was not enough, I will let you remember it for a long time today! {vpunch=10,0.5}
我看你不过是以什么敛息法门让我难以查探你的境界罢，区区手下败将装什么前辈！¤I see that you are just using the method of restraining your breath to make it difficult for me to check your realm. What kind of senior are your defeated generals!
哼，区区守门弟子竟敢对前辈不敬，星宫就是这么教导弟子的？¤Hmph, the mere gatekeeper disciples dare to be disrespectful to their seniors, is this how Xinggong taught the disciples?
但王登此时可没时间留意他们。¤But Wang Deng didn't have time to pay attention to them at this time.
我们还是别聊王长老，万一被听到，倒霉的就该是我们了。¤Let's not talk about Elder Wang. If we are heard, it will be us who are unlucky.
呵，对弟子不错？那也只是对你们女性修士而已。要知道，阿山这两天伤势才勉强恢复一点，又被王长老指派去完成那些最费力不讨好的师门任务了，都是些平时没人愿意接的活，甚至还有些以我们的修为很难处理的类型。就差把滥用职权写在脸上了。¤Oh, is it good for the disciple? That's only for you female cultivators. You know, Ah Shan has only barely recovered from his injuries in the past two days, and was assigned by Elder Wang to complete the most thankless tasks of the division. These are tasks that no one is willing to take on normally, and even some of them are based on our cultivation. A difficult type to handle. Almost had abuse of power written on his face.
啊，王前辈气量这么小么？我还以为他除了高傲了点外，对弟子还是不错的呢...¤Ah, is Senior Wang so small? I thought that apart from being a little arrogant, he treated his disciples well...
眼前的金丹修士竟是林家花园的那个登徒子，上次败于他手的屈辱你还铭记于心，不由得有些想法冒上心头。¤The Jindan cultivator in front of you is actually the disciple of the Lin Family Garden. You still remember the humiliation of losing to him last time, and you can't help but have some thoughts in your mind.
这好色的纨绔子弟怎么说也是金丹期修士，在哪个门派不是长老级别的人物，此刻竟被自己吓得步伐不稳，真是难得一见。¤This lascivious playboy is also a cultivator of the Jindan stage, in which sect is not an elder-level figure, at this moment, he is so scared that his steps are unsteady, which is really rare.
王登像是想到了什么不好的事情，脚下一滞，险些被自己绊倒，看得你也是一阵好笑。¤Wang Deng seemed to think of something bad, his feet stagnant, and he almost tripped over himself, which made you laugh for a while.
（当年在林府我就不是他对手，倒也...哎，还好后来没去找他麻烦，不然只怕...）¤(I wasn't his opponent in the Lin Mansion back then, but I...hey, fortunately I didn't trouble him later, otherwise I'd be afraid...)
（不会吧，我可是金丹期神修，竟探测不到他的修为！难不成他真是有了元婴期修为？）¤(No way, I am a cultivator of the Jindan stage, and I can't detect his cultivation! Could it be that he really has the cultivation of the Nascent Soul?)
王登一边说着，已是在前为你引路，但你还能听到他在小声嘀咕着什么。¤As Wang Deng spoke, he was already leading the way for you, but you could still hear him whispering something.
前辈请跟我来。¤Senior please come with me.
王登闻言愣了一会，半晌才恢复神态，早已退在一旁的男性守门弟子更是拼命憋着笑，乃至脸都涨得通红。¤Wang Deng was stunned for a while when he heard the words, before regaining his demeanor after a long while. The male gatekeeper who had already retreated to the side even tried his best to hold back his laughter, and even his face flushed red.
你什么你，我此番是为祝贺冲虚长老突破元婴而来，可没时间跟你个守门弟子浪费时间。还不速速去通报？¤What are you, I am here to congratulate Elder Chongxu for breaking through Nascent Soul, but I have no time to waste time with you, a gatekeeper disciple. Why don't you report quickly?
可不是么。上个月初阿山只是稍稍顶撞王长老，当场就被他以教导实战为由打成重伤，场面可惨烈了。¤But isn't it. Last month at the beginning of Ah Shan only slightly contradict Elder Wang, on the spot he was seriously injured on the grounds of teaching practical combat, the scene can be tragic.
冲虚长老已经在大殿等候了，前辈请随我来。¤Elder Chongxu is already waiting in the hall, senior please come with me.
前辈请稍候。¤Seniors, please wait.
听闻贵宫冲虚长老近期成功晋入元婴期，特来祝贺，想顺道与他畅谈一番这天地大道。¤Hearing that Elder Guigong Chongxu has successfully entered the Nascent Soul Stage recently, he came here to congratulate him and wanted to chat with him about this great avenue of heaven and earth.
可不是么。上个月初阿山只是稍稍顶撞王长老，当场就他以教导实战为由打成重伤，场面可惨烈了。¤Isn't it. At the beginning of last month, Ah Shan only slightly contradicted Elder Wang. On the spot, he was severely injured on the grounds of teaching actual combat. The scene was tragic.
{vpunch=10,0.5}你！你是当年那个不识好歹的修士！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}You! You were that ignorant cultivator back then!
哟，这不是王登王前辈嘛，几十年不见，还在当看门弟子呢？¤Yo, isn't this Senior Wang Dengwang, who hasn't seen him for decades, is he still a janitor?
星宫不接受外人拜访，还请见谅。¤Star Palace does not accept visits from outsiders, please forgive me.
白帝楼有些事要与星宫宫主商量。¤The White Emperor's House has some matters to discuss with the Star Palace Master.
明白了，前辈请随我来。¤Understood. Please follow me, seniors.
说话间，储物袋中的白帝信物已是出现在你手中。¤As you speak, the White Emperor token in your storage pouch has appeared in your hand.
为何大家都跑去港口了，莫不是出了什么事？要不我也去看看。¤Why is everyone running to the harbour, could it be that something has happened? Why don't I go and have a look too.
你在广陵城的街上走着，不知为何，街上的人纷纷向不远处的港口张望，一些人渐渐地向港口聚了过去。¤You are walking through the streets of Guangling City when, for some reason, people in the streets are looking towards the port not far away, and some are gradually gathering towards it.
哼，就爱凑热闹。也罢，就当是顺道去港口打探些消息，但记得可别摊上什么麻烦。¤Hmph, likes to get involved huh. Fine, just see it as gathering information then, but remember not to get into trouble.
百里奇盛怒之下拂袖而去，你看见他似乎又去往港口的方向。¤Bailiqi brushed off his sleeves in a fit of rage, and you saw him seemingly heading in the direction of the port again.
真没想到{FirstName}{xiongdi}竟是此等背信弃义之人！¤I really didn't expect {FirstName}{xiongdi} to be such a treacherous person!
百里兄久等了，我们这便返回无尽之海吧。¤Brother Baili has waited for a long time, let's return to the Endless Sea.
百里奇在不远处注视着你，你决定...¤The Baili Qi is not far away watching you, you decide...
城主近日有要事处理，暂不接纳外客，仙长请回吧。¤The city lord recently had important matters to deal with, temporarily do not accept foreign guests, the immortal please go back.
此乃百里私府，若无请帖恕不接待。¤This is Baili's private residence. We will not receive you without an invitation.
怎么了管家，是何人在门外？¤What is it butler, who is at the door?
少主，您怎么出来了？¤Young master, why have you come out?
这不是{FirstName}道友么？¤Isn't this {FirstName} daoist friend?
咦，这位道友年龄似与我相仿，不如同在下切磋一番？¤I'm not sure if I'm the same age as you, but why don't you come down here and have a sparring session?
这几日都不曾与人比试，一时技痒便出来转转...¤I haven't competed with anyone in the past few days, so I had an itch to come out and have a look around...
上次英杰会上输给你已经是{$year}年前的事情了，我一直念念不忘，就想再寻个机会同你比试一番，不想今日却在百里府相遇。¤It was {$year} ago that I lost to you at the last Yingjie meeting, and I've been thinking about it for a long time.
在下还有要事在身，不便于此久留，告辞。¤I have some important business to attend to, so I can't stay here long.
可惜...可惜...¤It's a pity... a pity...
正合我意！我便与你走上几招！¤That's what I want! I'll go out with you for a few moves!
前段时间英杰会一败后我便一直念念不忘，就想再寻个机会同你比试一番，不想却在百里府相遇。当真巧极妙极，快快请进。¤I've been thinking about it ever since I lost the Yingjie meeting a while ago, and I wanted to find another opportunity to compete with you. What a coincidence! Please come in.
巧极妙极，快快请进。¤Please come in.
少主前些日子随家族商队前往蓬莎岛了，阁下若有要事可前往无尽之海寻少主。¤The young master left for the island of Pongsha with the family caravan a few days ago, so if you have something important to do, you can go to the Endless Sea to look for the young master.
你依照约定来到百里家，但却并未发现百里奇的身影。¤You came to the Baili family in accordance with the agreement, but did not find the figure of Baili Qi.
和百里兄约定的时间还没有到，我还是晚些时候再来吧...¤The time agreed with Baili brother has not yet arrived, so I'd better come back later...
焦兄不在这里...看来他已经出发了。¤Brother Jiao is not here... It seems he has already departed.
嗯（这里一个两个都藏头漏尾的，不似善类啊。）¤Well (here one and two are hidden, they don't look like good ones.)
阁下，这交易会已经开始了。你在这里最好不要暴露了自己的真实身份，在下还有些别的事情，就先告辞了。¤Your Excellency, this trade fair has already started. You'd better not reveal your true identity here. There are other things in the future, so let's say goodbye.
前辈修为深厚，若是出手，此事定是手到擒来！¤Senior cultivation is profound, if you do, this matter will be handy!
嗯，我知道了。¤En, I know.
不必多礼，邀我来此究竟是为何事？¤No need to be polite, what exactly is the reason for inviting me here?
说着，他便双手作揖，深深地向你鞠了一躬。¤With that, he bowed deeply to you with both hands.
起初我还不是很在意，但就在前几日，我的一位好友也在方壶山附近失去了音讯……¤At first I was not very concerned, but just a few days ago, a good friend of mine was also lost in the vicinity of Fang Ju Mountain ......
前辈。¤Elder.
唉，可惜我不能亲手为他报仇...¤Alas, it is a pity that I cannot avenge him with my own hands...
谢过前辈。¤Thank you, seniors.
这次多亏你帮我，才能查清真相。等以后我修为精进后，一定也可以帮到你的！¤This time, thanks to your help, I was able to find out the truth. When I improve my cultivation in the future, I can definitely help you too!
就知道你会帮我，谢啦！¤I knew you would help me, thanks!
见过前辈。¤Well met seniors.
嗯，后会有期。¤Well, I'll see you later.
你修为尚浅，我一个人前去就好了，你就等我的消息吧。¤Your cultivation is still shallow, I'll just go ahead alone, just wait for my news.
此事晚辈必铭记在心。¤This matter will be remembered by the late generation.
你摇了摇头。¤You shook your head.
（“又是方壶山？我记得之前就曾在这里发生过散修失踪的事件，莫非...）¤(Fang Hu Mountain again? I remember that there have been incidents of missing independent cultivators here before, could it be...)
我本想彻查此事，可奈何实力不足，这才想起前辈。¤I would like to investigate this matter thoroughly, but I am not strong enough, which reminds me of seniors.
…说吧，喊我过来到底是有什么事？¤...Tell me, what exactly is the reason for calling me over?
如何？¤How?
他没有说话，只是向你深深鞠了一躬。¤He didn't say anything, he just bowed deeply to you.
（我派后山？我记得之前就曾在这里发生过散修失踪的事件，莫非...）¤(The back mountain of our sect? I remember that there was an incident of a missing independent cultivator here before, could it be...)
……你有这份心就好。¤...... It's good that you have this heart.
前辈你可算来了，我都等了好久了。¤Senior you finally came, I have been waiting for a long time.
怎么样了？¤how's it going?
我一好友于方壶山失踪，恳请前辈彻查此事。¤A good friend of mine disappeared in Fang Hu Mountain, I implore senior to investigate this matter thoroughly.
无妨，除魔卫道本就是吾辈职责所在。¤It does not matter, to get rid of the devil and defend the way is our duty.
抱歉，我没有找到幸存者。¤Sorry, I didn't find any survivors.
前辈你终于来了，我都等了好久了。¤Seniors you finally came, I have been waiting for a long time.
你如实讲述了这次经历，他原本期待的神情也变得失落起来。¤You recounted the experience truthfully, and his original expectant look became lost.
其实近来方壶山一带很不太平，经常有散修失踪的传言流出。¤In fact, recently the area of Fang Hu Mountain is very unsettled, there are often rumors of missing independent cultivators out.
此番让前辈只身犯险，还报了吾友之仇，这份恩情，真不知该如何报答前辈……¤This time let the seniors only risk, but also avenged my friend, this kindness, I really do not know how to repay the seniors ......
一会儿我开炉炼丹，你便开始帮我煽火。记住，我这炉丹须得炼制七七四十九天，期间丹火必须一直保持旺盛，不能有任何停顿。要是让我这一炉养气丹炼废了，你这{xiaozi}可赔不起。¤When I open the furnace to make the pills, you will begin to help me fan the fire. Remember, I have to refine this potion for seventy-seven to forty-nine days, and the fire must be kept going all the time, without any pause. If I ruin this furnace of qi-raising pills, you {xiaozi} can't afford to pay for it.
前辈误会了，在下...在下是刚入门的外门弟子，这次是不小心误入丹房，这便离开！¤Senior, you've misunderstood! I.. I'm a disciple who has just gotten started! I entered the Spirit Herb Hall by accident, so I'll be leaving..
他轻而易举地就把你像孩子似的提了起来，将你上下打量了一翻，你被他钳子一样的大手牢牢抓住，动弹不得。¤He easily lifted you up as if you were a child, looking you up and down. You were firmly in his grasp and could not move.
哼，又想反悔？我看你们这群外门弟子就该多吃吃苦，你今天可别想再跑了，谁来问我要人我都不放！¤Huh, you regret it? I think you outer disciples should suffer more.. Fine, run away today, I wont ask you if I need help anymore!
哼，又想反悔？好不容易青竹给我送来个靠谱的弟子，你今天可别想再跑了，谁来问我要人我都不放！¤Huh, I want to regret it again? After all, Qingzhu sent me a reliable disciple. Don't even think about running away today. I won't let anyone ask me if I want someone!
老夫{color=#d0380a}每年{/color}都会为宗门开炉炼丹，你要是有空，就来炼丹房帮忙煽火，好处我自然少不了你的。¤The old man {color=#d0380a} every year{/color} will open the furnace for alchemy for the sect. If you are free, come to the alchemy room to help fan the fire. Naturally, I can't do without you.
即便如此，在连续煽了七七四十九天后，你再也拿不住扇子，一屁股跌坐在地，大口地喘着粗气。好在由于这段时间不断的运转功法，消耗与吸收灵气，你的修为也似乎精进了不少。¤Even so, after several, or rather forty-nine days of constant work, you can no longer hold the fan and you fall to the ground gasping for breath. Fortunately due to the constant running of your cultivation technique your cultivation base seems to have improved a lot...
修为{color=#d0380a}+500{/color}¤Cultivation increased by {color=#d0380a}+500{/color}
你炼气中期的修为，举起数百斤的东西也毫不费力，但这扇子每挥一次，都要耗尽你全身的所有气力。你只能一边运转功法恢复体力，才能勉强维持住消耗。¤In the mid-stage of the Qi Refinement realm, you can easily lift hundreds of kilograms with little effort.. But every swing of this fan consumes large amounts of energy in your body. You can only barely mantain your energy by constantly running your cultivation technique..
算了算了，我这炉丹可不等人，这次就先用你这{xiaozi}吧。¤Forget it, I can't keep waiting, I'll use {xiaozi}'s help first.
啧啧，法力低微，力气又小，这青竹也太不厚道，怎么给我找了个这么孱弱的弟子来？¤Tsk tsk, your realm is so low.. The sect is really unkind, why did they find such a weak disciple to help me..
你炼气后期的修为，举起数百斤的东西也毫不费力，但这扇子每挥一次，都要耗尽你全身的所有气力。你只能一边运转功法恢复体力，才能勉强维持住消耗。¤In the later stage of your Qi refining, you can lift hundreds of kilograms without any effort, but every swing of this fan consumes all the energy in your body. You can only regain your physical strength while running the exercises. Maintain consumption.
前辈误会了，在下不知前辈正在开炉炼丹，这次是不小心误入丹房，这便离开！¤Senior misunderstood. I don't know that Senior is opening the furnace to make alchemy. This time he accidentally entered the alchemy room, so he left!
他一边说着，一边拎着你大步流星地走进丹房，然后把你放在丹炉边，从储物袋里取出一柄巨大地蒲扇，交到你手里。你一把抓住扇子，只觉得重的几乎难以握住，不由得心中暗自叫苦...¤As he said this, he walked into the Alchemy room with large strides, putting you down next to a pill furnace. He pulled out a large fan from his storage ring and handed it to you. Grabbing the fan you almost dropped it, it's so heavy! You're barely able to hold it and can't help but cry out secretly in your heart...
你走进炼丹房，一股浓郁的药香便包围了你，只是深深地吸了几口气，就让你觉得精神充沛了起来。正当你好奇地四处张望时，你被人从身后一把揪住...¤When you walk into the alchemy room, a strong medicinal fragrance surrounds you, just taking a few deep breaths, it makes you feel energetic. Just as you look around curiously, you are caught from behind. Hold it...
臭{xiaozi}，来得这么晚，还要老夫亲自出去找你么？¤{shidi} is too modest, even the chief disciple wasn't able to pass through the array while in the Qi Refinement realm... Your future is limitless.
不错...不错，资质根骨具佳，这次青竹倒是肯给我找个靠谱的弟子来了？¤Yes...Yes, I have good qualifications, but this time Qingzhu is willing to find a reliable disciple for me?
你炼气初期的修为，举起上百斤的东西也毫不费力，但这扇子每挥一次，都要耗尽你全身的所有气力。你只能一边运转功法恢复体力，才能勉强维持住消耗。¤In the early stage of your qi refining, you can lift hundreds of catties without any effort, but every swing of this fan consumes all the energy in your body. You can only regain your physical strength while running the exercises. Maintain consumption.
嘿，你修为虽差，不过毅力倒是可佳，也算是个可造之才。¤Hey, even though your cultivation level is really poor, your perseverance is good and you can be considered to be a talent.
老夫找人帮忙炼丹，丹成之后都会送一粒作为报酬，这枚养气丹你且收下。¤The old man needs an assistant to help with Pill refinements. After the Pill is synthesized, I will give you one as a reward. You can take this Lesser Qi Pill for now.
你眼前是一个由龙尸死气组成的巨大气旋，但气眼却不断地产生勃勃生机，生与死在此刻达到了微妙的平衡。¤In front of you is a huge cyclone composed of dragon corpse death energy, but the air eye is constantly generating vitality, and life and death have reached a delicate balance at this moment.
死极反生！¤Death is reborn!
不过，若是小友对于蜕凡化神成竹在胸，也可以化神之后再来，届时必然收获更大。¤However, if you are ready breakthrough to Deity Transformation, you can also come back after you have Deity Transformation, and you will certainly reap greater rewards then.
之后的事小友也就知道了，鲲族孽畜来袭，他们避难此地并以此建立了龙宫。¤The little friend also knew what happened after that. The evil animals of the Kun tribe attacked, and they took refuge here and established the Dragon Palace.
不过此地因为是后天促成，过于脆弱若不是突破元婴我龙族中人也不得在此修炼。¤However, because this place is acquired, it is too fragile, and if it is not for breaking through the Nascent Soul, people in the dragon clan cannot cultivate here.
龙族竟能以后天之力培养出天地异象，确实是底蕴深厚。¤The dragon clan can actually cultivate the vision of heaven and earth with the power of heaven, which is indeed profound.
小友准备好了？¤Are you ready, little friend?
你醒来发现九霄大圣一直维持着此地的运转，那团魂火似乎暗淡了几分。¤You wake up and find that the Great Sage Jiuxiao has been maintaining the operation of this place, and the soul fire seems to have dimmed a bit.
小友过誉了，此地乃是先天极阴之地，这天地异象还是占据地利之功。¤The little friend is overrated, this place is a place of congenital extreme yin, and this vision of heaven and earth still occupies the advantage of the geographical advantage.
化神便是蜕凡成仙的过程，此地死极反生之象暗含天地运转之道。小友进入其中修炼可以提前积累几分仙性。¤Deity Transformation is the process of transforming from a mortal to an immortal, and the image of the deadly rebirth here implies the way the heavens and the earth work. Little friends can accumulate a bit of immortality in advance by entering into the practice.
你感受这生死轮转，陷入了空灵之境。¤You feel the cycle of life and death, and you are caught in an ethereal state.
当年，我发现此地之不凡将这里作为我龙族龙墓之一，以我龙族强者的尸身进一步温养此地。¤Back then, I discovered the extraordinaryness of this place and made it one of the dragon tombs of my dragon clan, and further nourished this place with the corpses of my dragon clan strongmen.
（怪不得九霄能一举获得龙宫大阵的掌控权。）¤(No wonder Jiuxiao was able to gain control of the Dragon Palace Great Array in one fell swoop.)
看来小友收获不小，此番我消耗不少，恕不远送了。¤It seems that the little friend has gained a lot. I have consumed a lot this time, and I will not give it away soon.
不错，此地正是天地异象——死极反生之象。¤Yes, this place is the vision of heaven and earth - the phenomenon of death and rebirth.
不可思议！{shidi}你...你居然闯过了幻雾阵！¤Unbelievable! {shidi}You...you actually broke through the Mirage Mist Array!
就连大师兄都没能在炼气期就完整闯过幻雾阵，{shidi}的前途不可限量啊。¤Even the big brother failed to get through the Mirage Mist Array completely during the refining period, {shidi}'s future is limitless.
恭喜{shixiong}成功闯出了幻雾阵！¤Congratulations to {shixiong} for successfully breaking out of the Mirage Mist Array!
{shidi}过谦了，就连大师兄都没能在炼气期就完整闯过幻雾阵，{shidi}的前途不可限量啊。¤{shidi} is too modest, even the big brother has not been able to completely pass the Mirage Mist Array during the refining period, {shidi}'s future is limitless.
你又来到此处，远远的便瞧见拿到耀眼的金色遁光。今天一定要抓住那个胆敢挑衅禾山道的散修！¤You come here again, and you can see the dazzling golden light from a distance. Today, you must seize the independent cultivator who dared to provoke Heshan Dao!
这样做的风险是不是太大了，万一百里家护送商品的队伍里有筑基期的修士怎么办？¤Is it too risky to do so? What should I do if there are Foundation cultivators in the base-building period in the escort team of Wanbaili?
{vpunch=10,0.5}轰！¤{vpunch=10,0.5} Boom!
广陵城百里家的势力非同小可，大家切记，一定不要留下任何一个活口！¤The power of the Baili Family in Guangling City is not trivial. Please remember that you must not leave any one alive!
哼，下次我一定能抓住你。¤Hmph, I will definitely catch you next time.
嘘！敛息隐蔽，等他们进入大阵再动手。¤Hush! Keep your breath and hide, wait until they enter the big formation before you start.
哼，这个禾山道小鬼，速度倒还挺快，正好，让我看看你有什么能耐！¤Huh, the Heshan Dao kid, the speed is quite fast, just so, let me see what you can do!
动手！¤Do it!
一道金色的遁光从你前方掠过，似乎是在挑衅你，你想起麻老九交代的事情，这应该就是上次他说的那个散修吧！¤A golden light flashes in front of you, it seems to be provoking you, you remember the things Ma Laojiu explained, this should be the independent cultivator he said last time!
老大！好...好像有人来了！¤Boss! Okay...it seems someone is coming!
你奋力追赶，但显然，那人的遁术远高于你，很快便不见了踪影。¤You struggled to catch up, but obviously, that person's escape technique was much higher than yours, and he soon disappeared.
放心，如果有筑基期修士，我来负责对付。有大阵的加持，就算是筑基后期的修士，我也可以应付的来。¤Don't worry, if there are cultivators in the foundation building period, I will be responsible for dealing with them. With the blessing of the big formation, even the cultivators in the late foundation period can handle it.
我已经在此处用火铜布下了赤炎灵阵，等百里家的商队到了，我便会启动大阵。你们身上带着我给你们的阵符，就可以避开大阵的攻击。等大阵启动之时，我们便一起出手。¤I have laid the Chiyan Spiritual Formation with a fire copper cloth here, and when the caravan from the Baili family arrives, I will activate the Great Formation. You can avoid the Great Formation by carrying the formation amulet I gave you on your body. Attack. When the big formation starts, we will attack together.
一道传音自麟庙中传出。¤A voice transmission came from the Temple of the Lin.
{FirstName}{shidi}，家师想要见见你，不知可否方便？¤{FirstName}{shidi}, my master would like to meet you, I wonder if it is convenient for you?
我这就来。¤I'm on my way.
外门弟子不得随意出入宗门大殿¤External disciples are not allowed to enter or leave the sect hall at will
宗门重地，外门弟子不得随意出入。¤The important place of the clan, outer disciples are not allowed to enter or leave at will.
麟庙大门紧闭，门前空无一人。¤The gates of the Lin Temple are closed and the doors are empty.
麟庙重地暂不开放，若是无事，还请速速离去。¤The important grounds of the Lin Temple are closed for the time being, so if there is nothing else, please leave quickly.
麟庙重地暂不开放，{shidi}若是无事，还请速速离去。¤The important grounds of the Lin Temple are closed for the time being, so {shidi} if there is nothing else to do, please leave quickly.
师兄，可是还有指教？¤Brother, do you have more advice?
嗯，我明白了。（转身离开）¤Yeah, I got it. (turns to leave)
指教倒是称不上....¤I wouldn't call it instruction ....
对方面露犹豫，似在犹豫当不当讲。¤The other side shows hesitation, as if debating whether to speak.
我观{shidi}气息，可是修炼了《魔焰决》？¤When I look at {shidi}'s breath, is it a cultivation of the Demonic Flame Duel?
魔焰决虽是本门奇功，但是有损本源，{shidi}修行之时切记不可贪图一时之利。¤Although the Devil's Flame Duel is a marvelous technique of our school, it is detrimental to the original source, so when practicing it, remember not to crave for momentary benefits.
多谢师兄忠告。¤Thanks for the advice, brother.
{xiaozi}，最近麟庙闭门谢客，没事别捣乱。¤{xiaozi}, the Lin Temple is recently closed to visitors, so don't make any trouble.
一道神识从扫过你。¤A soul sense sweeps over you from.
我还是不要乱逛为好。¤It's better if I don't wander around.
{shidi}，留步。¤{shidi}, stay back.
麟庙之下一股巨大的生机与火灵气交织在一起，忽强忽弱好似心脏的跳动。¤Beneath the Lin Temple a great vitality intertwines with the fire aura, which is strong and weak as if it were the beating of a heart.
在此关键之时，我还是不要打扰了。¤At this critical time, it is better for me not to intrude.
你刚走近宗门广场，只听一道气息悠长的笑声传到你的耳边。¤You just approached the Sect Square, and only heard a long breath of laughter reach your ears.
跟我来，我这便带你去拜见长老。¤Come with me, I'll take you to pay your respects to the elders.
大长老的声音：哈哈哈哈，{FirstName}师侄，恭喜你证得金丹大道，还请来大殿一叙。¤Voice of the Grand Elder: Hahahaha, {FirstName} nephew, congratulations on your attainment of the Golden Core Avenue, and please come to the hall to give a comment.
我古月寨不接外客。¤I do not accept outside guests at Gu Yue Cottage.
一片废墟也没什么好看的。¤There is nothing to see in a ruin.
道友，我玄古门不接外客，还请回吧。¤Fellow Daoist, my Profound Ancient Sect does not accept foreign guests, so please return.
奇怪，怎么连值守的弟子也没有？¤Strange, why is there not even a disciple on guard?
此处守山大阵全力运转。¤This mountain guarding formation is in full operation.
{LastName}，快走。本门出现重大变故有可能会波及到你。¤{LastName}, get out of here. It is possible that a major change in our clan could affect you.
此时一道传音符从阵内飞出。¤At this moment a sound transmission talisman flew out from within the formation.
好，我现在被困于地下二层炼血台，我们见面谈。¤OK, I am now trapped in the Blood Refining Terrace on the second basement level, let's meet and talk.
你我相识一场，怎能袖手旁观？¤You and I have known each other for a long time, how can we stand by and watch?
什么事情也没有发生。¤Nothing has happened.
空间通道被毁，已经不可能再回宁州古迹了...¤The spatial channel was destroyed, it's no longer possible to return to the Ning Province monument...
要进入空间裂隙么？¤Do you want to enter the spatial rift?
你凝聚周身灵力，纵身跃入空间裂隙之中...¤You must gather your spiritual energy and leap into the spatial rift...
宁州古迹每隔千年方可进入一次，我还是等{color=#d0380a}第500年{/color}时再来吧。¤The Ning Province monument can only be entered once every thousand years, so I'll wait until {color=#d0380a}the 500th year{/color}.
阁下是第一次来天机阁吧。¤Your Excellency is the first time to come to Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
正是，阁下是？¤Exactly, sir?
道友自己转转吧，我就不打扰了。¤Fellow Daoist go around by yourself, I won't bother.
我天机阁主要分为主阁，天衍阁和拍卖行。¤My Heavens Secrets Pavilion is mainly divided into Main Pavilion, Tianyan Pavilion and Auction House.
拍卖行自是举行拍卖会的地方，10年一届，金丹期修士便可参加。¤The auction house is the place where auctions are held. Once every 10 years, the Jin Danian cultivators can participate.
主阁，乃是阁主之所在，如无要事还请道友不要靠近。¤The main pavilion is where the pavilion master is. If you have nothing to do, please don't come near you.
刚刚进入大门，远处一名修士向你走来。¤Just entering the gate, a cultivator in the distance came towards you.
在下天机阁接引执事，就由在下向你介绍一下吧。¤I'm the deacon of reception here in the Heavens Secrets Pavilion, let me introduce it to you.
天衍阁是我天机阁售卖情报玉简之所，道友要是有兴趣探探秘境，不妨去看看。¤The Heavenly Diffraction Pavilion is where I sell information jade slips from the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, so if you are interested in exploring the secret realm, you might want to take a look.
大比还没有开始。¤The great competition has not yet begun.
这一次的大比真是精彩。¤This time the great competition is really wonderful.
道友，天机阁核心区域还请止步。¤Fellow Daoist, please stop at the core area of Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
明白了...道友请随我来。¤Understand... Fellow Daoist, please follow me.
前辈请进。¤Seniors please enter.
你看到眼前的建筑笼罩在一层薄薄的光幕之下，走近之时，你感到身上天机令一阵波动，光幕开启一个通道。\n¤You see the building in front of you Shielded under a thin curtain of light, and as you approach, you feel a fluctuation in your body's Tianji order, and the curtain of light opens a channel. \n
道友，我天机阁拍卖会需金丹修士持有天机令方可进入。¤Fellow Daoist, my Heavens Secrets Pavilion auction requires a Jindan cultivator with a Tianji Order to enter.
你看到眼前的建筑笼罩在一层薄薄的光幕之下，走进之时将你弹开。\n¤You see the building in front of you Shielded in a thin curtain of light, walk into when you bounce away. \n
道友请进。¤Fellow Daoist, please enter.
你点点头，若有所思的走入拍卖行。¤You nod your head and walk thoughtfully into the auction house.
道友有所不知，由于此次拍卖事关重大，所以各门派、家族都只是派了代表前来。¤Daoist friend has no idea, because this auction is of great importance, so the sects and families have only sent representatives to come.
今天不是拍卖仙府钥匙么，怎会如此冷清？¤Today is not the auction Immortal Palace key, how can it be so cold?
刚进入光幕你就发现拍卖场和平时不太一样。原本热闹非凡的拍卖场如今竟是显得有些冷清。¤Just enter the light screen you will find that the auction house is not the same as usual. The original lively auction house is now a little cold.
你看到眼前的建筑笼罩在一层薄薄的光幕之下，走近之时，你感到身上的天机令一阵波动，光幕开启一个通道。¤You see the building in front of you Shielded in a thin layer of light curtain, approaching, you feel a fluctuation in the body of the Heavenly Mystery Order, the light curtain opened a channel.
没想到{mengpai}竟能觅得如此良才，第一次参加试炼便有此佳绩，实是宗门幸事啊！¤I didn't expect {mengpai} to be able to find such a good talent. The first time I participated in the trial, I had such a good result. It is a blessing for the sect!
此事牵扯过多......唉，师妹暂且别再提及为上。¤This matter is too involved...Ah, Junior Sister, don't mention it again for the time being.
一口一个师兄倒是叫得挺甜，不过某些人毕竟境界有限，也只能逞逞口舌之快。¤One mouthful, one senior is very sweet, but some people are limited in their realm after all, and they can only do their best to speak quickly.
在他的接引下，你来到了同门修士暂居之处。¤Under his guidance, you came to the temporary residence of the fellow Daoist.
背负剑匣的黄衫男修面色两难地站在中间，一副手足无措的模样。¤The yellow-shirted man with a sword box on his shoulders stood in the middle with a dilemma, looking at a loss.
......道友看来对自己的相貌十分自信。¤...The Daoist seems to be very confident in his appearance.
试炼之地一片荒芜，受禁制松动泄露的魔气影响几乎没有植物生长，嶙峋尖锐的山石遍布视野可及之处。¤The land of trial is deserted, and there is almost no plant growth under the influence of the magical energy leaked by the loosening of the prohibition, and the rugged and sharp rocks are everywhere in the field of vision.
言罢，玄道宗长老周身泛起蓝色光晕，不远处的禁制遥相呼应般地亮起，随着长老法力的注入一行行纹路于禁制上凝现而出。¤After saying this, the elder Mystic Daozong has a blue halo around his body, and the prohibition not far away is lit up like a distant echo, as the elder's mana injects a line of lines on the prohibition.
嘿嘿，这位道友不好意思，请问离火门的营地在哪边啊？¤Hey, this fellow Taoist is embarrassed, may I ask where is the Heavenly Fire Gate camp?
依我看这阵......¤From my perspective...
不同宗门的修士分散在禁制前的空地上各自为营，熙攘的人群给这片荒凉的土地带来别样的生机。¤The cultivators of different sects were scattered in the open space before the prohibition, and the bustling crowd brought a different kind of vitality to this desolate land.
熟料天不遂人意，刚闭上眼睛就被重重拍了一巴掌。你略微恼怒地转过头去，发现对方是位离火门弟子。¤The clinker was unsatisfactory, and as soon as I closed my eyes, I was slapped again. You turned your head slightly angrily and found that the opponent was a disciple from the Heavenly Fire Gate.
哼，起码我不会两面三刀丢下师兄独自一人。¤Hmph, at least I won't leave my brother alone.
好嘞，那就不叨扰道友了。¤Okay, then don't bother fellow daoists.
魏无极话还没说完，你便被一股强大的吸力传送进另一个空间。还没等看清周边事物就两眼一黑昏了过去。¤Before Wei Wuji finished speaking, you were sent into another space by a powerful suction. Before you could see the surrounding things, your eyes went dark and fainted.
{FirstName}{LastName}，{$TempValue}只！¤{FirstName}{LastName}, {$TempValue} only!
我姓{FirstName}名{LastName}，邢兄赤子之心，我也正有心结交。如若再次相遇我定愿和邢兄结伴同行。¤My last name is {FirstName} and my first name is {LastName}. Brother Xing has a sincere heart, and I am also interested in making friends. If I meet again, I will go with Brother Xing together.
嗨，我一兰枝玉树临风流倜傥小郎君看着像是挑事儿的人吗？¤Hey, do I look like a suave little man who is a troublemaker?
多谢道友！这帮修士实在心性凉薄，我一连问了几位都没有得到回应。¤Thank you fellow daoists! These cultivators are so cold-hearted, I asked a few of them and I didn't get a response.
此外，你们手中的天魔令会通过吸收魔物残魂记录每位弟子斩杀的魔物数量。¤In addition, the demon order in your hand will record the number of monsters killed by each disciple by absorbing the remnants of the monster's soul.
凭着来时的印象，你大致说出了一个位置。¤Based on your impression when you came, you roughly gave a position.
一阵眩晕过后，你已回到试炼之地入口处。¤After a while of dizziness, you have returned to the entrance of the trial place.
想来除去境内遇险弟子，所有人都传送而出。清点人数后请各派以自身灵气激活天魔令上的印记，静候本派弟子前去记录。¤I want to get rid of the disciples in distress in the territory, everyone sent it out. After counting the number of people, please activate the imprint on the demon order with their own spiritual energy, and wait for the disciples of this school to record.
你想起各门派貌合神离的盟约，不禁感慨人心难测，这位邢兴星也不知有何企图。¤When you think of the covenants of various schools that seem to be in harmony with the gods, you can't help feeling that people's hearts are unpredictable, and this Xing Xingxing doesn't know what he wants.
哈哈哈，那我便先前去寻找宗门所在，有缘自会相见。¤Hahaha, then I went to find where the sect is, and I will meet by chance.
循着声音望去，一位身材娇小的黄衣女修与一位面容秀美的蓝袍女修发生了争执。¤Following the voice, a petite female sister in yellow had a dispute with a beautiful blue-robed female sister.
想来除去境内遇险弟子，所有人都传送而出。清点人数后请诸位小友以自身灵气激活天魔令上的印记，静候本派弟子前去记录。¤I want to get rid of the disciples in distress in the territory, everyone sent it out. After counting the number of people, please use your aura to activate the imprint on the demon order, and wait for the disciples to record.
看来这天魔眼以上古秘法封印，如彻底溃散怕是倾整个宁州之力也未必能够重建，难怪每隔二十年就需要修士除魔以免禁制生变。¤It seems that the ancient mystery seal above the Demon Eye of this day, if it is completely broken, it may not be possible to rebuild it with the power of the entire Ning Province. It is no wonder that every 20 years, cultivators are required to exterminate demons in order to avoid changes.
你独自一人，无门无派，从玄道宗的执事那里领取了天魔令后，便随便找了块空地盘腿坐下，准备趁此机会先调整一番。¤You are alone, no school or faction. After receiving the Heavenly Demon Order from the deacon of Mystic Dao Sect, you just found an open space and sat down cross-legged, ready to take this opportunity to adjust first.
不多时，这二名玄道宗弟子便已行至你面前。¤In a short while, these two Mystic Dao Sect disciples have already walked in front of you.
道友此话差矣，入口处有一玄道宗弟子专门负责接引各派修士，想来其他人或许会认为道友是刻意挑衅。¤Fellow Daoist's words are not correct. At the entrance, there is a disciple of Mystic Dao Sect who is responsible for attracting cultivators of various factions. If you want to come, other people may think that Friends are deliberately provoking.
嘿嘿，这位道友不好意思，请问竹山宗的营地在哪边啊？¤Hehe, this fellow Taoist is embarrassed, may I ask where is the camp of Bamboo Mountain Sect?
外界发生的事并不能影响你修练的打算，毕竟前方目的地险象环生，还是多做些准备为好。¤What happens outside does not affect your training plan. After all, the destination ahead is dangerous, so it's better to be more prepared.
人群中负责计数的弟子一位高声喊出修士的杀魔数量，一位在本子上记载下来。¤One of the disciples in the crowd who was in charge of counting shouted out the number of cultivators killed, and one recorded it in the notebook.
{color=#d0380a}三十日{/color}后禁制将再次开启将诸位传出，若无天魔令则陷于其中无法出脱。¤{color=#d0380a}After thirty days{/color}, the ban will be reopened and you will be sent out. If there is no demon order, you will be trapped in it and cannot escape.
穿着竹山宗道袍的修士好像东北方多一点，道友不妨前去查探一番？¤The cultivators wearing the robes of the Bamboo Mountain Sect seem to be a little bit more in the northeast. Why don't you go and check it out?
众人喧闹间，这二名玄道宗弟子已行至你面前。¤Amid the noise of everyone, these two Mystic Dao Sect disciples have already walked in front of you.
熟料天不遂人意，刚闭上眼睛就被重重拍了一巴掌。你略微恼怒地转过头去，发现对方是位竹山宗弟子。¤The clinker was unsatisfactory, and as soon as you closed your eyes, you were slapped again. You turned your head slightly annoyed and found that the other party was a disciple of the Bamboo Mountain School.
正打算闭目养神时，你听见不远处传来一阵嘈杂的吵闹声。¤When you were about to close your eyes and rest your mind, you heard a noisy noise not far away.
嘘，听说李青麟是为了照顾那些修为略弱的师弟师妹才落得此等成绩。¤Shhh, I heard that Li Qinglin got this grade just to take care of those juniors and younger sisters who have a slightly weaker cultivation level.
试炼之地如上届一样人声鼎沸，想来也只有这个时段此地才热闹异常。¤The place of trial is the same as the last one, and it is only at this time that this place is very lively.
那么本届猎魔试炼就此结束，我派长老还需在此加固天魔眼的封印，诸位道友现在可以自行返回各自的宗门了。¤Then this trial of demon hunting is over. Our Sect the elders to reinforce the seal of the eyes of the demon here, and all fellow daoists can now return to their respective sects by themselves.
离火门的大师兄当真神武，方才那竹山宗的李青麟斩杀了11只魔物便成赛中佼佼者，他竟超出这许多！¤The big brother from Heavenly Fire Gate really is a martial artist, and Li Qinglin of the Bamboo Mountain Sect has just killed 11 monsters and became the best in the game. He has exceeded this by a lot!
试炼结束后会在本地举行一场{color=#d0380a}杀魔竞赛{/color}，获胜的弟子将得到宗门奖励，望诸位多加努力。¤After the trial, there will be a {color=#d0380a}killing contest{/color} in the local area. The disciples who win will be rewarded by the sect. I hope you can work harder.
你向天魔令缓缓注入灵力，令牌闪烁着零星冰蓝光点，逐渐汇聚成古朴的苍色文字。¤You slowly inject spiritual power into the demon order, and the token flashes with sporadic blue ice dots, gradually converging into primitive pale text.
待老夫看看......像是失传已久的上古符箓。¤Look at the old man...like a long-lost ancient talisman.
你收下这些丹药回去好生炼化，不要浪费了自己在修炼一途上的天赋。¤You accept these medicines and go back to refining, don't waste your talent on the way of cultivation.
所谓机遇险中求，试炼之地虽险却孕育诸多奇材异宝，能否得取便看你们自身机缘。只一件事你们切莫遗忘，临行前所得的天魔令万万不可遗失。¤In dangerous situations we seek opportunities. Although the place of trial is dangerous, it's full of strange treasures. Whether you can get it depends on your own chances. But you must not forget one thing, before successfully taking the Heavenly Demon Order, you cannot go lost.
你......！¤you......!
上届猎魔试炼里也记不清是谁结盟时信誓旦旦，结果见形势不对却趁乱带着同门一并溜走，害得师兄们差一点就此陨落！¤In the last demon hunting trial, I couldn't remember who made the vows when they formed an alliance, but when the situation was wrong, they slipped away with the same door in the chaos, and the brothers almost fell!
请问道友可是{menpai}所属？¤Does fellow daoist {menpai} belong to?
炎萧，17只！¤Yan Xiao, 17!
没想到师姐还与金虹剑派那两个弟子有这等瓜葛...¤Unexpectedly, Senior Sister would have such an affair with the two disciples of the Golden Rainbow Sword School...
并未等候多长时间，玄道宗长老便将你等传送进了天魔眼。¤It didn't take long to wait, the elder Mystic Daozong teleported you into the eyes of the demon.
全场鸦雀无声。¤The audience was silent.
这九转丹有增进修为的功效，在三品丹药中也算是比较稀有的。¤This Greater Qi Pill can boost your cultivation, and it is relatively rare even among other third-grade Pills.
请问各位道友可是{menpai}所属？¤Does all fellow Taoists belong to {menpai}?
你此番在天魔眼中的表现还算不错，不过似乎也没什么人特别在乎你的成绩。¤Your performance in the eyes of the devil this time is pretty good, but no one seems to care about your results.
几名玄道宗的修士从你手中接过天魔令，开始清算这届试炼中大家的成绩。¤Several cultivators of the Mystic Dao Sect took the Heavenly Demon Order from you and began to liquidate everyone's achievements in this trial.
想必各位已经知晓此次试炼缘由，老朽便不多赘述。¤Presumably you already know the reason for this trial, so I won't repeat it for the old.
那是当然。¤Of course.
不错，不错...{FirstName}{LastName}，你此行着实表现出彩，宗门决定给你额外奖励。¤Yes, yes... {FirstName}{LastName}, you really showed great color during this trip, and the sect decided to give you extra rewards.
前方突然传来一股强大的灵力波动，你意识到什么抬头望去，发现正是玄道宗长老莅临。¤Suddenly there was a strong wave of spiritual power in front of you. You realized what you looked up and found that it was the elder Mystic Daozong who was here.
就第一次参加猎魔试炼而言，这个成绩也不算很差了，你总算松了一口气。¤As far as participating in the demon hunting trial for the first time, this result is not too bad, you finally breathed a sigh of relief.
没想到师兄师姐还有这等瓜葛...¤Unexpectedly, the brothers and sisters would have this kind of connection...
邢兄不妨先与宗门众人汇合，后日若再次相遇自是再好不过。¤Brother Xing might as well meet everyone from the Zongmen first, and it would be great if we meet again in the future.
“星河剑派？根据衣着想必另外两位一定是金虹剑派的弟子了。”¤The Galaxy Sword Sect? Based on their clothes, the other two must be disciples of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect.
天魔眼里当然只有同门才值得依靠，你这{color=#d0380a}星河剑派{/color}的弟子好生荒唐，凭什么让师兄与你结伴而行？¤Of course, in the eyes of the demon, only the same school is worthy of relying on. You are a disciple of the {color=#d0380a} Galaxy Sword Sect{/color}, so ridiculous, why let the senior brother be with you?
一阵笑声打破寂静，众人循声望去，发现高台上的通羽真人抚掌而笑。¤A burst of laughter broke the silence, and everyone followed the prestige and found the real Tong Yu on the high platform smiling with his palm.
请带队之人随我前去登记，其余弟子在此等候即可。¤The person who leads the team, please follow me to register, and the rest of the disciples can wait here.
哈哈哈哈哈哈，真乃后生可畏啊！¤Hahahahahaha, it's really terrifying for the young generation!
你极目远眺，只见形状怪异的生僻符号组成了那些光带。¤You look far away, and you see strangely shaped and rare symbols forming those bands of light.
瞧我，咱俩也别道友来道友去了。我叫邢兴星，见道友古道热肠便心生亲近之意。此行前路艰险，届时你我相遇秘境也算有个照应。¤Look at me, the two of us don't come here. My name is Xing Xingxing. I feel close to each other when I see Taoist friends. The road ahead is difficult and dangerous. When you and I meet in the secret realm, you will be able to take care of it.
你暗自忖思，摇了摇头准备继续方才被打断的修练。¤You thought to yourself, shook your head and prepared to continue the training that was only interrupted.
哎...算了，这种事情我还是少打听为好。¤Hey... Forget it, I'd better not inquire about this kind of thing.
老头，你知道这玩意儿什么门道吗？¤Old man, do you know the way this thing is?
听了一旁化尘教弟子的无心之言，本就忐忑不安的你更加难堪。你带着复杂的表情将天魔令出示给计数弟子，视线却心虚地落向一边。¤Hearing the unintentional words of the disciples of the Huachen Cultivation, you, who were already nervous, were even more embarrassed. You showed the demon order to the counting disciple with a complicated expression, but your eyes fell to the side with a guilty conscience.
唐森，6只！¤Townson, six!
你粗略估计了一下，自己击杀的魔物应与炎萧相近，便面有傲色地递出天魔令。¤You have a rough estimate. The monster you killed should be close to Yan Xiao, so he handed out the Heavenly Demon Order with an arrogant face.
另外，在天魔眼内获得“灵核”者，皆可凭此与我派驻守执事兑换其它资源。¤In addition, anyone who obtains the spiritual core in the eyes of the demon can use this to exchange other resources with the deacon I dispatched.
不过一群废物罢了，出门历练最后却靠师兄收拾烂摊子。修为如此还是趁早回家种田，明年也能“自食其粟”了。¤But it's just a bunch of rubbish, but at the end of going out to experience, I relied on my seniors to clean up the mess. As for the cultivation base, it is better to go home to farm as early as possible, and you will be able to feed yourself next year.
不知道若是遇上危险你这张嘴能否劝退高级天魔？¤I don't know if you are in danger, can you persuade the high-level demons to retreat?
“外界传闻这两派素来交好，没想到在试炼之地却表现得并不和睦，看来当真是己派利益优先。”¤It is rumored that the two factions have always been good friends, but they did not expect to behave in harmony in the place of trial. It seems that the interests of their own factions are the priority.
哈哈哈哈，不错，不错...¤Hahahaha, good, good...
请道友随我前往{menpai}营地。¤Please ask fellow Taoists to follow me to the {menpai} camp.
话音刚落，人群中爆发出阵阵惊叹。¤As soon as the voice fell, bursts of exclamation broke out from the crowd.
你且去问他，别打扰我修练。¤You go and ask him, don't disturb my practice.
一阵眩晕过后，你已回到试炼之地入口处。高台上各宗长老负手而立，许有要事宣布。¤After a while of dizziness, you have returned to the entrance of the trial place. The elders on the high platform stand with their hands, and Xu You will announce important things.
穿着离火门道袍的修士好像东北方多一点，道友不妨前去查探一番？¤The cultivators wearing robes from the Heavenly Fire Gate seem to be a little more northeast. Why don't fellow daoists go and check it out?
此番在天魔眼中的表现着实一般，你感到脸色发烫，只能默默地低下了头。¤This time the performance in the eyes of the demon is really mediocre, you feel your face is hot, you can only lower your head silently.
好在并没有预想中的冷嘲热讽，你松了口气转过头来，却正对上长老失望的目光。¤Fortunately, there is no expected cynicism. You turned your head in a sigh of relief, but you are facing the disappointed gaze of the upper elder.
（胜过炎萧是没什么希望了，但我猎杀的魔物应当和李青麟不相上下，统归不太丢人。）¤(There is no hope of surpassing Yan Xiao, but the monsters I hunt should be on par with Li Qinglin, and all are not as shameful.)
同门¤The same family
李青麟¤Li Qinglin
照你这么说，以后这青石灵脉就是谁后台硬就归谁，还有什么公平可言？¤According to what you said, in the future, this bluestone spiritual vein will be owned by whoever insists on the backstage. What is fair?
如果是你要采这灵脉，我技不如人也不会多说什么。可这灵脉分明是那喽啰要用，你凭什么帮他出手？¤If you want to take this spiritual vein, I won't say much if I'm not as skilled as others. But this spiritual vein is clearly used by that minion, why do you help him?
这挖出来的东西本就是我们山门所得，只是由我小弟代劳而已，我出手又有何问题？¤The things we dug up were originally obtained by our mountain gate, and it was just done by my younger brother. What's the problem with me?
我最后奉劝你一句，这青石灵脉自然是强者所得，你们实力不足，乖乖拱手相让便是，别不识好歹。¤I would like to advise you finally, this bluestone spiritual vein is naturally acquired by the strong, and you are not strong enough, so you should just surrender, don’t know what’s good or bad.
在一阵哄笑声中，{ta}转过身去，默默离开了。¤In a burst of laughter, {ta} turned around and left silently.
既然比试已经输了，还留在此地作甚？丢人现眼吗？¤Since the test has been lost, what are you still doing here? Disgraceful?
只见他的法袍已经变得破破烂烂，身上也是伤痕累累，显得极为狼狈。¤I saw that his robe had become tattered, and his body was covered in scars, making him look extremely embarrassed.
他运起功法攻了过去，但根本不是对手，不一会儿就败下阵来。¤He used the martial arts to attack the past, but he was not an opponent at all, and he was defeated in a short while.
岂有此理...{FirstName}道友，你有信心打过他吗？¤That's outrageous... Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, do you have the confidence to beat him?
这便是你请来的救兵？好像也没有强到哪里去啊？¤Is this the rescuer you invited? It doesn't seem to be strong, where is it?
若真打起来，一个失手…呵呵，说不定就小命不保了。¤If there is a real fight, one misses... Hehe, maybe his life will be lost.
…也罢，我去会会他。¤...well, I'll go meet him.
他实力很强，我只怕不是对手…¤He is very strong, I am afraid that he is not an opponent...
我来吧。¤Let me do it.
只是我技不如人，让{FirstName}道友见笑了。¤It's just that my skills are not as good as others, which made fellow Daoist {FirstName} laugh.
若你能叫来比我强的，我们自然转身就走。¤If you can call someone stronger than me, we will naturally turn around and leave.
没事，这点小伤过两天就好了，你不必担心。¤It's okay, this little injury will be fine in two days, you don't have to worry.
循着{ta}所指的方向望去，只见一群低阶修士毕恭毕敬地簇拥着一人，其境界已然达到筑基后期。¤Looking in the direction pointed by {ta}, I saw a group of low-level cultivators respectfully surrounding one person, whose realm had already reached the late stage of foundation establishment.
{FirstName}道友，可算把你等来了，就是他们。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, it can be considered that they are waiting for you.
…你没事吧？¤…Are you OK?
不过刚刚进来的时候，我发现入口附近的杂草都有被踩踏的痕迹。我想，应该已经有什么人先我们一步来到这里了。¤But when I just came in, I noticed that the weeds near the entrance showed signs of being trampled on. I think someone should have come here before us.
这御剑门的遗迹规模都如此之大，想必从前也是一个了不起的大门派吧。¤The scale of the ruins of the Imperial Sword Sect is so large, it must have been a great martial art before.
不错，这里确实让我有一些熟悉的感觉。¤Yes, it does give me some familiar feelings here.
听大师兄说，各大门派都有可以进入这里的信物，也许是别的门派也发现了剑灵的异动，派人前来勘察的吧。¤I heard from the big brother that all sects have tokens that can enter here. Maybe other sects have also discovered the abnormal movement of the sword spirit, so they sent people to investigate.
老头，可是货真价实一千多年前的遗迹，你多瞅两眼，说不定能在这里想起些什么呢。¤Old man, it's a real relic over a thousand years ago. If you look at it more, maybe you can think of something here.
一道剑气突然从身后向你袭来，你堪堪躲过。扭头一看，只见一柄魔气四溢的灵体状仙剑正向你挥来...¤A sword aura suddenly hits you from behind, you can easily avoid it. Turning around, I saw a magical spirit-like fairy sword swinging towards you...
你在一片朦朦海雾中迷失了方向，回过神时发现自己已经回到了永安镇。¤You get lost in a hazy sea fog and find yourself back in Yongan Town when you look back.
道友所为何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤What do you want? What is it?
道友请回，星河剑派恕不招收男弟子。¤Please return, the Star River Sword Sect does not accept male disciples.
大师姐正在宗门广场主持一年一度的入门测试，道友请跟我来。¤Senior sister is presiding over the annual initiation test in the sect square, so please follow me.
即将开放¤About to open
这里受{SayStcVal=928}所管辖，我这样贸然闯入似乎不太好...{w}{w=0.5}¤This place is under the jurisdiction of {SayStcVal=928}, it doesn't seem right for me to barge in like this... {w}{w=0.5}
要干什么？{w}{w=0.5}¤What will you do ? {w}{w=0.5}
要去什么地方？{w}{w=0.5}¤Where are you going? {w}{w=0.5}
由你和公孙季领头，一众修士徐徐进入涵虚仙府。¤Led by you and Gongsun Ji, a group of cultivators slowly entered Hanxu Immortal Mansion.
在宝光的照耀下，仙府外围的阵法逐渐消融，涵虚仙府的正体也是出现了在你们眼前。¤Under the shining of Baoguang, the formations around Xianfu gradually melted away, and the body of Hanxu Xianfu also appeared in front of you.
简单的商量好仙府中的机缘根据各人贡献分配后，公孙季示意你可以打开仙府了。由于凑齐了涵虚玉佩可以给你带来大量贡献，所以你也没有异议，只是转身准备拿出玉佩。¤Simply discuss the opportunity in the fairy mansion and allocate it according to the contributions of each person, and Gongsun Ji signaled that you can open the fairy mansion. Since the collection of the hanxu jade pendant can bring you a lot of contributions, you have no objection, just turn around and prepare. Take out the jade pendant.
为防生变，在下建议还是早些进入仙府为好。¤In order to prevent changes, it is better to enter the fairy house earlier.
我们刚才在附近巡查了一番，目前没发现更多魔修。¤We just patrolled the neighborhood, and we haven't found any more evil cultivators.
你摇了摇头，但慕容颖还是用水系神通为你做了简单的治疗。¤You shook your head, but Murongying still gave you a simple treatment with water-based magical powers.
抱歉，我们来晚了。{FirstName}{gongzi}可有被魔门妖人所伤？¤Sorry, we are late. Was {FirstName}{gongzi} hurt by the demon?
你和魔修缠斗数回合终于将之击败，但战斗的余波也引来了附近的正派修士，看来先行进入仙府抢得先机的计划是无法继续进行了。¤You and the evil cultivator fought for a few rounds and finally defeated it, but the aftermath of the battle also attracted the orthodox cultivators nearby. It seems that it is no longer possible to continue the plan to enter the immortal's residence first to get the upper hand.
正当你打算取出涵虚玉佩时，一道术法从背后袭来，居然是魔修偷袭！¤Just when you were about to take out the Hanxu jade pendant, a spell attacked from behind, and it was actually a sneak attack by the evil cultivator!
你想起公孙季在拍卖会后所说的话，觉得这涵虚仙府必定是机会与危险共存的。但还是决定先行进入仙府占得先机。¤You think of what Gongsun Ji said after the auction. You feel that this imaginary fairy mansion must coexist with opportunity and danger. But you still decided to enter the fairy mansion first.
由你和公孙季领头，一众修士徐徐进入了涵虚仙府。¤Led by you and Gongsun Ji, a group of cultivators slowly entered Hanxu Immortal Mansion.
经过商讨后，你们决定等到结束后再按各人贡献积分分配。当然，你提供的涵虚玉佩也会增加贡献积分。¤After discussion, you decided to wait until the end and then distribute the points according to each person's contribution. Of course, the hanxu jade pendant you provide will also increase the contribution points.
在场各大家族少主，门派首徒等或是出言同意，或是沉默不语，一时间倒是也没人站出来反对。¤The young masters of the major families and the first disciples of the sects who were present either agreed or were silent, but for a while, no one stood up against it.
公孙兄所言极是，如今魔门蠢蠢欲动，我们在探访仙府时还是通力合作，减少损失为上。¤What Brother Gongsun said is extremely true. Now that the Demon Sect is ready to move, when we visit Xianfu, we still work together to reduce losses.
诸位请稍等，我们还是在进入之前商量一下其中机缘怎么分配为好。¤Everyone, please wait a moment, we'd better discuss how to allocate the opportunities before entering.
在宝光的照耀下，仙府外围的阵法也是逐渐消融，涵虚仙府的正体也是出现了在你们眼前。¤Under the shining of Baoguang, the formations around Xianfu gradually melted away, and the body of Hanxu Xianfu also appeared in front of you.
你发现原本应该散落在储物法宝空间各处的玉佩，居然不知何时因为阵法共鸣而接触在了一起。三块原本破旧的玉佩此刻却是散发着氤氲宝光，一时是交相辉映，令人目接不暇。¤You find that the jade pendants that were supposed to be scattered around the magic treasure storage space, you don't know when they came into contact with each other because of the resonance of the formation. The three dilapidated jade pendants are now exuding rich light, and for a while, they complement each other. People are overwhelmed.
你点点头，走到阵前从储物法宝中打算取出三块涵虚玉佩解除护府大阵。¤You nodded, walked to the front of the array and planned to take out three pieces of han virtual jade pendant from the storage magic treasure to release the palace guardian array.
{FirstName}{gongzi}不必担心，不过是些落单魔修，料想是刚好在附近而已。¤{FirstName}{gongzi} don't worry, it's just a lone evil cultivator, I think it happens to be nearby.
我也只是比公孙兄早到一点而已。这附近既然有魔修出现，恐怕此次涵虚仙府出世还是走漏了消息。¤I just arrived a little earlier than Brother Gongsun. Since there are evil cultivators around here, I am afraid that this time the birth of Hanxu Immortal Mansion has still leaked the news.
公孙季正微笑着站在你的禁制前，仿佛你的禁制不存在一般。他的身后站着各大势力的金丹修士，看来都是为了涵虚仙府而来的。只不过有些修士衣衫稍有不整，显然是之前在战斗中吃了点亏。¤Gongsun Ji is standing in front of your restraint with a smile, as if your restraint does not exist. Behind him stood the jindan cultivators of the major powers, all of whom seemed to have come for the Hanxu Immortal Mansion. Only some of the cultivators are slightly unkempt, obviously having suffered some losses in the battle before.
{FirstName}{gongzi}久等了，在下前来时遇到了魔门修士，花费了些时间处理。¤{FirstName}{gongzi} waited for a long time. When I came here, I ran into the cultivator cultivator, and it took some time to deal with it.
你想起公孙季在拍卖会后所说的话，觉得没必要先行犯险，于是寻了一地布下简单禁制掩盖气息，一边调息一边等待正派道友。¤You remembered what Gongsun Ji said after the auction, and felt that there was no need to commit a risk first, so you found a place to spread a simple prohibition and cover up, adjusting your breath while waiting for a decent fellow daoist.
经过商讨后，你们决定等到结束后，按各人贡献积分分配。当然，你提供的涵虚玉佩也会增加贡献积分。¤After discussion, you decided to wait until the end and distribute the points according to each person's contribution. Of course, the hanxu jade pendant you provide will also increase the contribution points.
在场各大家族少主，门派首徒等或是出言同意，或者沉默不语，一时间倒是也没人站出来反对。¤The young masters of the big families and the first disciples of the sects who were present either agreed or were silent, but for a while, no one stood up against it.
在宝光的照耀下，仙府外围的阵法逐渐消融，涵虚仙府的正体也是出现在了你们眼前。¤Under the shining of Baoguang, the formations around Xianfu gradually melted away, and the body of Hanxu Xianfu also appeared in front of you.
公孙季见状也取出自己的玉佩。原本破旧的玉佩在齐聚后居然散发出氤氲宝光，一时是交相辉映，令人目接不暇。¤Gongsun Ji also took out his jade pendant when he saw it. The original worn jade pendant exuded a dazzling light after the gathering, and the radiance of each other for a while, it was overwhelming.
你点点头，也不多做言语，从储物法宝中取出了自己的玉佩。¤You nodded and didn't say much, you took out your jade pendant from the storage magic treasure.
不知{FirstName}{gongzi}手上可有涵虚仙府的玉佩。¤I don't know if {FirstName}{gongzi} has a jade pendant from the Xuxian Mansion.
但还没来得及细细欣赏仙府坐落处的风景，你就已经看到公孙季在向你招手。他的身边已经聚集了许多宁州正派修士。¤But before you can take a closer look at the scenery where Xianfu is located, you have already seen Gongsun Ji beckoning to you. Many Ning Province decent cultivators have gathered around him.
这涵虚仙人不愧是阵道高手，若不是我凑齐了三个涵虚玉佩，只怕是站在阵前也寻不着仙府所在。¤This Hanxu immortal is worthy of being a master of formation. If I hadn't collected three Hanxu jade pendants, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to find the location of Immortal Palace even if I stood in front of the formation.
只见此间三山环抱，又有灵泉从山腰潺潺而下，汇聚谷底渐成一湖。你矗立湖前，或闻猿啸山间，鸟鸣高枝，又见灵气散逸谷间，在阳光照射下如氤氲之境，端的是个建设洞府的好去处。¤I saw three mountains here, and there are spirit springs gurgling down from the mountainside, gathering at the bottom of the valley and gradually forming a lake. You stand upright in front of the lake, or hear the apes roar in the mountains, the birds sing high and the branches, and the spiritual energy is dissipating in the valley, in the sun. The bottom is like an enchanting state, and it is a good place to build a cave mansion.
根据之前公孙季放出的消息，你顺利来到涵虚仙府应在之地。¤According to the news released by Gongsun Ji, you have successfully arrived at the place where Hanxu Immortal Mansion should be.
道友，我化尘教暂时不便接待外客。¤Fellow Daoist, it is temporarily inconvenient for my Dust Transformation Sect to receive outside guests.
看来道友是第一次来我天机阁，就由在下介绍一番。¤It seems that you are the first time to come to my Heavens Secrets Pavilion, so let me introduce you.
这里就是天机阁了吧，好生气派。¤This is the Heavens Secrets Pavilion, isn't it? It's so grand.
道友，请~¤Please, fellow Daoist~
而且我们不仅仅买卖宝物，消息情报也是我们的经营范围。¤The first time I saw you, I was in the middle of a conversation.
同时也会举办各个境界的修士集会，交流修炼心得，交易物品。¤We also hold gatherings of cultivators from all realms to exchange cultivation tips and trade items.
我天机阁收集天下奇珍异宝，每10年一届，举办拍卖会。金丹期以上修士方可参加。¤We collect exotic treasures from all over the world and hold an auction every 10 years. Cultivators above the Golden Dan stage are allowed to participate.
看来，已经有人邀请过前辈了，那我就不多做打扰了。¤It seems that someone has already invited seniors, so I won't bother you much.
你穿过天机阁大门，身上的天机令似乎受到感召一阵颤动，迎面一位天机阁修士迎接你。¤You pass through the gate of Heavens Secrets Pavilion, the Tianji Order on your body seems to be inspired by a tremor, and you are greeted by a Heavens Secrets Pavilion cultivator.
你穿过天机阁大门，迎面一位天机阁修士迎接你。¤You go through the gate of the Heavenly Chance Pavilion, and you are greeted by a Heavenly Chance Pavilion cultivator.
前辈不妨都前去看看，说不定大有收获。¤Seniors might as well go ahead and take a look, there may be a great harvest.
我天机阁收集天下奇珍异宝，每10年一届，举办拍卖会。金丹期修士就可参加。¤I Heavens Secrets Pavilion collect the world's exotic treasures, once every 10 years, held an auction. Golden Dan stage cultivators can participate.
看来前辈是第一次来我天机阁，就由晚辈介绍一番吧。¤It seems that senior is the first time to come to my Heavens Secrets Pavilion, so I'll introduce you.
前辈，请~¤Senior, please~
道友不妨都前去看看，说不定大有收获。¤Daoist friends might as well go ahead and take a look, there may be great rewards.
这是我天机阁信物天机令，请您收好。¤This is my heavenly machine pavilion token heavenly machine order, please keep it.
看来前辈应该是升至金丹期之后第一次来我天机阁，这天机令还请前辈收好。¤It seems that senior should be the first time to come to my Heavens Secrets Pavilion after ascending to the Jindan stage, this Tianji order also please keep it.
你穿过天机阁大门，身上的天机令似乎受到感召一阵颤动。¤You walk through the door of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion, and the Tianji order on your body seems to be inspired by a tremor.
{xiaozi}好胆，竟然还敢上门？¤The {SayStcVal} has the guts to come to the door?
只见一道屏障，护住了整个天机阁，你几番试探都难以攻破。¤I saw a barrier covering the entire Heavenly Secret Pavilion, and it would be difficult for you to break it after several temptations.
{FirstName}道友，这边请。¤{FirstName}Daoist, this way please.
还未行至九嶷山，李青麟便踏剑飞上前来。¤Before they reached Jiuyi Mountain, Li Qinglin came flying up on his sword.
道友止步，沃焦山一带乃我{SayStcVal=928}管辖范围，非我派弟子不得入内。¤The area around Inferno Mountain is under my {SayStcVal=928} jurisdiction, and no non-disciples of our sect are allowed to enter.
参见长老。¤See the Elders.
沃焦山本就是火系灵气浓郁之地，常有灵兽聚集。和本门弟子之间也算是井水不犯河水，但近来也不知为何，山中妖兽狂暴起来甚至主动袭击本门弟子。¤The Wogao Mountain is originally a place where fire-based spiritual energy is dense, and there are often spiritual beasts gathering there. But recently, for some unknown reason, the Spirit Beasts in the mountain have become violent and even attacked our disciples on their own initiative.
能细说说么？¤Can you tell us more about it?
嗯...倒也没什么，只是最近山里的妖兽都不太平。¤Well... It's not much, it's just that the mountains have been unsettled by Spirit Beasts lately.
最近有什么异常么？¤Has there been anything unusual lately?
（这沃焦山还挺热闹的，我跟上去看看来者什么路数。）¤(There's quite a buzz on this Wauchau Mountain, so I'll follow them up and see what kind of visitors they are.)
你察觉有两名金丹修士恰逢此时偷偷潜入。¤You perceive that two Golden Core cultivators have sneaked in at just the right time.
道友，来离火门有何贵干？¤Fellow Daoist, what do you want to do here at the Heavenly Fire Gate?
我们离火门招收弟子，不看资质悟性，但对门内弟子要求极严，能成为我们离火门内门弟子的，无一不是意志坚定，一心向道之人。道友若真有这样的大决心，便跟我来吧。¤Our Heavenly Fire Gate does not look at qualifications and enlightenment, but we are extremely strict with our disciples. Those who can become disciples of our Heavenly Fire Gate are all determined and single-minded. If you really have such a strong determination, then follow me.
大师兄正在养剑池主持一年一度的仙资大会，道友请跟我来。¤The elder brother is presiding over the annual immortal capital meeting at the Sword Raising Pond, so please follow me.
道友留步，天魔眼每隔{color=#d0380a}二十年{/color}才会解开入口的封印。如今时间未到，道友还是过段时间再来把。¤The Heavenly Demon Eye is only unsealed every {color=#d0380a}twenty years{/color}. The time has not yet arrived, so you should come back some time later.
天魔眼封印所限，只对{color=#d0380a}筑基期{/color}修士开放，道友请回吧。¤The Heavenly Demon Eye seal is only open to {color=#d0380a} Foundation Stage{/color} cultivators, so please return.
道友，来我竹山宗所为何事？¤What is the reason for your visit to the Bamboo Mountain Sect?
我们竹山宗对外门弟子也有极高的要求，我看你还是去别的宗门碰碰运气吧。¤Our Bamboo Mountain Sect also has extremely high requirements for outer disciples, I think you should try your luck in another sect.
大师兄正在宗门广场开设擂台，招收外门弟子，道友请随我来。¤Senior Brother is opening a ring in the sect square to recruit outer disciples, so please follow me, fellow Daoist.
这方壶山受{SayStcVal=928}所管辖，我这样贸然闯入似乎不太好...{w}{w=0.5}¤The Fang Hu Mountain is under the jurisdiction of {SayStcVal=928}, so it doesn't seem right for me to barge in like this... {w}{w=0.5}
嗯？慢着，你会青蛇劲？¤Huh? Wait a minute, you know the Azure Snake Art?
原来是您就是青蛇真人，授业之恩请受小子一拜。¤So you are honoured Lord Azure Snake. Please allow this disciple show respect for your teachings.
晚辈，不过随意走动，打扰到了前辈，这就离开。¤Junior, but walking around at will, I bother senior, and leave now.
前辈真是慧眼如炬。¤Senior is so insightful.
小子，幻雾阵不去闯闯，来这后山乱逛什么啊？？¤Boy, if I don't want to break through the Mirage Mist Array, why do you come here to wander around in the back mountain?
晚辈告退。¤The junior retire.
哈哈哈，不错。你小子倒是懂礼貌，这本《青蛇要诀》乃是老夫当年所创《青蛇劲》的配套功法一并传你吧。¤Hahaha, not bad. You know your manners. This Azure Snake Sutra is the supporting technique of the Azure Snake Art created by me back in the days. I will also teach you now.
这后山多是前辈高人的闭关之所，我还是不要胡乱走动为好。¤This back mountain is mostly a retreat for seniors, I'd better not walk around randomly.
打扰倒是谈不上，本座也不过是闭关结束，走走而已。¤I can't talk about interruption, and this seat is just a walk away after the retreat is over.
行了，你下去吧。¤Okay, you can go down.
本座出关后，发现有人击败了灵体，倒是好奇谁人能够做到？没想到是你小子。¤After I left the gate, I found that someone had defeated the spirit body, but I was curious about who could do it? I didn't expect it to be your kid.
现在还不到英杰会的比试年份，升仙台附近冷冷清清，没有什么人。¤It was not yet the year of the Yingjie Competition, and the area around the Ascension Terrace was cold and empty.
筑基丹嘛，\r顾名思义，便是炼气期修士在突破筑基时服用的重要丹药。若是筑基时若能服下几颗，能让筑基轻松不少。¤The Foundation Establishment Pill is, as the name implies, an important pill for cultivators at the Qi Refining stage to take when they break through the Foundation Establishment. If you can take a few of these when building your foundation, it can make building your foundation a lot easier.
适逢英杰会，武陵城聚集着众多炼气期修士，还有不少凡人也趁着热闹一拥而上，将升仙台围得水泄不通。\r¤It was the time of the Yingjie meeting, and many Qi refining stage cultivators gathered in Wuling City, as well as many mortals who took advantage of the hustle and bustle to swarm around the Immortal Ascension Platform. \r
倪旭欣神秘兮兮地说道，眼中闪烁着按捺不住的兴奋。¤Ni XuXin said mysteriously, with a gleam of pressed excitement in his eyes.
筑基丹？¤Foundation Pill?
以道友如今的修为，就安心在下面观战便好。但要是手痒难耐，想试上一试，上台参战也并无不可，不过就是要支付上台的费用罢了。¤With your current level of cultivation, you can just watch the battle from below. But if you are itching to try your hand at it, there is nothing wrong with going up to the stage to take part in the battle, but you will just have to pay for the cost of going up.
你好不容易挤过人山人海，总算来到赛场下面。¤You manage to squeeze through the crowds and finally make it to the bottom of the field.
武陵城升仙台下，不知何时树立起了一座高高的白玉石台，一枚玉简在阵法的加持下悬浮于石台之上，引得不少人来此围观。¤A high white jade platform was erected below the Immortal Ascension Platform in Wuling City, and a jade slip was floating on top of the platform with the effects of a formation, attracting many spectators.
是啊，看这挺热闹的，也想参赛试试。¤Yeah, it's pretty lively and I'd like to enter to try it out.
而且这功法玄妙非常，我也说不上来，喏，你看，石台就在那里，你去试一试就知道了！¤And this technique is very mysterious and special, well I can't quite describe it. There, look, the stone platform is right there, just go and see for yourself!
那道友还是先听我说说英杰会的门道了。¤That fellow Taoist should listen to me first to talk about the doorway of the Heroic Society.
只不过...甚是邪门。¤Only... Very strange.
从古至今，不知多少练气修士为其争个头破血流。作为英杰会的奖品，前来争夺者更是络绎不绝。¤From ancient times to the present day, many Qi cultivators have fought over it. As the prize of the Ying Jie Hui, there is an endless stream of people who come to compete for it.
这位小友，可是第一次来英杰会？¤Is this your first visit to the Yingjie Club?
我才开始修炼，上台恐怕也不会取得什么名次，不如在台下观战积累经验。等修为提升后，再来参加下一届的大比也不迟。¤I've only just started my training, so I'm afraid I won't achieve any ranking on the stage, so I might as well watch the battles on the stage to gain experience. It's not too late to come back for the next big competition when my cultivation level has improved.
要知道{color=#d0380a}修为境界{/color}可是一切的基础，除非你有足够精妙的\r神通功法搭配，或是有着各种强大的法宝丹药，或是对某些大道有着独到的感悟，才有可能在越级之战中取胜。¤You should know that {color=#d0380a}the cultivation realm{/color}is the foundation of everything, unless you have a sufficiently subtle \r divine power technique to go with it, or have various powerful magic treasures and pills, or have a unique perception of certain dao, it is possible to win in a battle across the levels.
多谢道友指点。¤Thank you for pointing it out, my friend.
这本功法要不是困在宁州古迹之中，恐怕也难逃散佚的噩运。¤Had it not been trapped in the Ancient Ning Province ruins, this technique would not have escaped the fate of being scattered.
不过嘛，道友是第一次来的话，还是建议在台下观战比较好。¤However, if this is your first time here, it is advisable to watch the battle from the stage.
你瞧！那可是从宁州古迹中带出来的功法，是古代大能的心血结晶！¤Look! That's a technique recovered from the Ancient Ning Province Ruins, the magnum opus of ancient cultivators!
你远远观瞧，台下围者甚众，修士云集，除了形形色色的散修之外，最显眼的便是金虹、星河两大剑派的弟子们，石台旁还有一位竹山宗修士。¤As you can see from afar, there are many people gathered around the stage, and apart from the many different kinds of independent cultivators, the most conspicuous ones are the disciples of the Radiant and Celestial River Sword Sects, and there is also a cultivator of the Bamboo Mountain Sect beside the stone platform.
哦？不知这是为何？¤Oh? I wonder why that is?
我武陵城英杰会乃是宁州炼气修士第一盛会，不但可以和其他炼气修\r士切磋交流，若能拔得头筹，更是有{color=#d0380a}筑基丹{/color}作为冠军奖品。¤The Wuling City Yingjie Meeting is the number one event for Qi refining cultivators in Ning Province, not only can you spar with other Qi refining cultivators, but if you can come out on top, you will even get {color=#d0380a} Foundation Establishment Pill{/color} as the prize for the champion.
还有这种事，老夫我也是有兴趣得很，咱们一起去看看吧。¤To think there's such a thing, I am also very interested, let's check it out together.
你可算来了，我和你讲，这次这功法可着实来头不小！¤You're finally here, I'm telling you, this is a very big deal!
记得还小的时候，常常听前辈们讲述古代剑修的传说。古时候的剑修们可是真的神通广大，可惜大部分法门不知怎的相继失传了。¤When I was young, I remember listening to the legends of ancient sword cultivators. The sword cultivators of old were really powerful, but it is a pity that most of the techniques have somehow been lost.
愿闻其详。¤Appreciate further details.
那倒不是，只是很奇怪，就连白帝楼最博学的陈长老都看不出门道。听说他之前为了参悟这功法，整整闭关了三年！¤It's not that, it's just strange that even the most knowledgeable Elder Chen of the White Emperor Pavilion couldn't figure it out. I heard that he had previously spent three whole years in seclusion trying to comprehend this technique!
不可能！这本书是在宁州古迹的一位古修身上发现的，逝者是一位当年金虹剑派赫赫有名的长老，陈长老自己也研究过，不会戏言，不信你去看看便是。¤Impossible! This book was found on an ancient cultivator at the Ancient Ning Province Ruins. The deceased was a famous elder of the Golden Rainbow Sword School back then, and Elder Chen himself studied it, so he wouldn't be joking, just take a look if you don't believe me.
升仙台上刀光剑影，五行法术纷呈异彩，初入仙门的你只觉精妙万分，一时沉浸其中。修为+{color=#d0380a}500{/color}，心境+{color=#d0380a}2{/color}¤Drown in the spectacular sword fights on the stage, and spells from the five elements, this is the first time since your immortal cultivation that you feel this way and you immersed yourself in it for a while. Cultivation +{color=#d0380a}500{/color}, state of mind +{color=#d0380a}2 {/color}
升仙台的附近人山人海，英杰会的大比似乎马上就要开始了...¤The area around the Ascension Terrace was packed with people, and it seemed that the Great Competition of the Yingjie Association was about to begin...
有这么邪门？那会不会是功法有误？¤Is it that strange? Could that a problem with the technique?
小友，你往那边看，他们就是即将上台斗法的修士们。¤Little friend, look over there, they are the cultivators who will be fighting on the stage soon.
小友竟不知道筑基丹？这倒新鲜，你定是刚进入修仙界不久吧。¤You don't know about the Foundation Establishment Pill? You must have just entered the Immortal Cultivation World, right?
虽然大部分路人不过是看个热闹，但也有不少好剑之人久久驻足，或是比划着某种剑招，或是口中念念有词，试图领悟玉简中所记录的功法。¤Although most passers-by were just watching, there were many good swordsmen who stopped for a long time, either gesturing at some kind of sword stance or mumbling words under their breath, trying to comprehend the techniques recorded in the jade slip.
{xiaozi}，你也听刚才那人说了，这英杰会是炼气后期修士的天下，还不是你这修仙新手能相与的，还是先观战，{color=#d0380a}五年后{/color}再来挑战吧。¤{xiaozi}, you also heard what that man said just now, this Yingjiehui is the world of late Qi refining cultivators, it is not yet something you, a novice immortal cultivator, can compete with, it is better to watch the battle and {color=#d0380a} come back in five years {/color} to challenge.
你看，他们都是{color=#d0380a}炼气中后期{/color}的修士，不少是身经百战之人。面对他们，\r小友自觉有几分胜算？¤You see, they are all {color=#d0380a}mid to late qi refining {/color} cultivators, many of whom are battle-hardened. If you face them, how many chances do you think you have of winning?
顺着方向看去，只见那边一个特殊的看台之上早已坐满了人，他们或\r紧张准备，或胸有成竹，或谈笑风生。唯一的共同点便是他们的气息\r都比练气初期的修士要醇厚数倍有余。¤When I looked in the direction, I saw that a special grandstand over there had long been filled with people, who were either \r nervous and ready, or had their chests ready, or were talking and laughing. The only thing they had in common was that their auras \r were more than several times thicker than those of early Qi training cultivators.
邪门？难道是邪道功法？¤Strange? Could it be evil techniques?
当然，这种热闹事怎么可能少得了倪家大少。倪旭欣老远便看到了你，招了招手，传音示意你有话要说。¤Of course, how could such a lively affair be without the Ni family's younge master. Ni XuXin saw you from afar and beckoned, sending a message that he had something to say.
前辈，可有吩咐？¤Seniors, can you give orders?
你转过身看向他，只见他面带微笑的看着你，但一股凌厉的气势仍从其体内发散开来。这样的气息你似乎在倪旭欣的身上也感受到过，但远没有如此犀利。¤You turn to look at him, only to see him looking at you with a smile on his face, but a harsh aura still emanates from his body. Such an aura you seem to have felt in Ni XuXin's body, but it was nowhere near as sharp.
此人修为至少筑基后期，{xiaozi}你小心应对。¤This person's cultivation is at least the late stage of foundation building, {xiaozi} you deal with carefully.
一道温和的声音，在你耳边响起。¤A gentle voice rings in your ears.
这位小友，请留步。¤This little friend, please stay.
呵呵，小友不必担心，我乃白帝楼执事。小友可听说过白帝楼？¤Oh, you do not have to worry, I am the White Emperor House deacon. Have you heard of the White Emperor Building?
我白帝楼是百余年前由九州第一剑修“白帝”在武陵城创立的松散剑修组织，宗门弟子与散修皆可加入。¤The White Emperor House is a loose organization of sword cultivators founded by White Emperor, the number one sword cultivator in the Nine Provinces, in Wuling City more than 100 years ago. Both disciples of the clan and independent cultivators can join.
既然小友已经听说过我白帝楼，那我便切入正题了。¤Since you have heard of my White Emperor House, I will cut to the chase.
我白帝楼乃是松散剑修组织，宗门弟子与散修的青年才俊皆可加入，执行一些针对{color=#d0380a}魔修{/color}的任务或是情报换取我楼中剑术典籍。¤I am a loose sword cultivation organization, sect disciples and young talents of independent cultivators can join to carry out some tasks against {color=#d0380a} evil cultivators {/color} or information in exchange for my building's sword art books.
哈哈哈，你若先加入了其它宗门也无妨。¤Hahaha, it wouldn't hurt if you joined another clan first.
对方似是看出了你的疑虑。¤The other side seems to have seen your doubts.
小友刚刚获得英杰会魁首，我特来邀请你加入我白帝楼。¤The young friend has just won the top of the Yingjie Association, I came to invite you to join my White Emperor House.
但贡献突出者若仍是{color=#d0380a}散修之身且剑道初窥门径{/color}，便可加入我白帝楼成为内阁弟子，获得我楼内的剑术传承。¤However, if the outstanding contributor is still a {color=#d0380a} independent cultivator and has a first glimpse of the sword path{/color}, he can join my White Emperor House as a disciple of the inner pavilion and obtain the sword art inheritance within my building.
这是{color=#d0380a}白帝令{/color}，小友收好。¤This is the {color=#d0380a}White Emperor's Order{/color}, young friend keep it.
你不必急着答应我，等你有空时，带着这枚令牌亲自来白帝楼看看再做决定也不迟。¤You don't have to promise me in a hurry, when you are free, bring this token and come to the White Emperor House to see for yourself before making a decision.
这白帝楼和其它修仙宗门...¤This White Emperor House and other immortal cultivation sects...
平日里我们会举办各种集会交流剑道，意在除魔卫道，还九州一个安宁。¤On weekdays, we will hold various gatherings to exchange swordsmanship, with the intention of eliminating demons and defending the way to return peace to the Nine Provinces.
你进入这废弃洞府准备寻找那叛逃修士的踪迹，突然一股凌厉的杀气从身后袭来。¤You enter this Abandoned Abode and prepare to look for traces of the renegade cultivator when a sudden, harsh killing aura comes from behind you.
也不知这里是哪位前辈以前闭关修炼时的洞府，虽然看上去破败了点，灵气也不及客栈来的充裕，但收拾收拾倒也是个不错的闭关之所，起码比住客栈便宜多了。¤I don't know which senior's cave was used for retreats, but although it looks a bit dilapidated and the aura is not as abundant as the inn, it is a good place to retreat, at least it is much cheaper than staying in an inn.
正当你准备好好观察一番洞府的环境时，一阵杀意突然从背后袭来。¤Just as you are about to take a good look around the cave, a killing intent suddenly comes from behind you.
趁着年轻还是多出去走走看看，这世界虽然凶险，但也是精彩得很。什么时候干什么事情，待你结丹结婴之后怕是想不闭关苦修都难了，但切记不要乱了道心。¤You should go out and see more while you are young, this world is dangerous but it is also wonderful. Do what's appropriate for the time. When the time comes for core and soul formation you would be hardpressed to do anything but isolate yourself and focus on cultivation, just remember not to lose yourself.
否则，碌碌无为一生，待到寿元将尽、临危突破之时才发现失之毫厘，谬以千里。在凡人面前自诩长生的仙人，最后依旧逃不出化为一抔黄土之命运，可就贻笑大方了。¤Otherwise, you will spend your whole life in vain, only to find that you have missed the mark by a thousand miles when you are about to reach the end of your life span. The immortals who boast of their longevity in front of the mortals will still be reduced to a handful of dust a laughingstock the world over.
修炼固然重要，但你要记住，没有人是枯坐修炼就能成仙的。嘿嘿，要是这样，这修仙界怕不是早就是乌龟精的天下了。¤Cultivation is important, but you have to remember that no one can become an immortal just by sitting withered and cultivating. Hey, if that were the case, I'm afraid the immortal world would have been the domain of turtle spirits long ago.
未待运气调息，先前所见的几招凌厉的剑式在脑海中浮现出来挥之不去，你眉头微皱，似乎从中感觉到了从未有过的浓浓剑意，不禁站起身来拔出铁剑，手痒想要试上两招。¤You can't help but stand up and draw your iron sword, itching to try out a few moves.
嘿嘿，你倒确实勤奋得很，先前为师有些严苛，错怪你了，你莫要放在心上。¤Hehe, you are really quite diligent. Earlier, I was a bit harsh and misjudged you, don't take it to heart.
咱们之前一直餐风露宿、寻觅仙门，今日终于到了这修士云集之处，就没有什么想再问问的吗？¤We've been sleeping in the open and searching for sects for awhile, but today we've finally arrived at a place where cultivators congregate, isn't there anything you'd like to ask?
想要问鼎那仙家登峰造极之处，必须老老实实下常人不能下之苦功，付出常人难以能付出之{color=#d0380a}时间{/color}。不过，如何合理地{color=#d0380a}安排时间{/color}和付出努力同等重要，至于如何安排，那便要看你的智慧了。¤If you want to reach the pinnacle of immortality, you must put in the hard work that ordinary people refuse and devote {color=#d0380a}time{/color} that ordinary people cannot. However, it is just as important to be able to {color=#d0380a}organise your time{/color} wisely as it is to put in the effort, As for how to arrange it, that depends on you.
先前那倪道友与邪修缠斗之时，我观你目光炯炯，聚精会神，又是频频点头，想必定是有所{color=#d0380a}思绪{/color}吧。¤When that Daoist Ni was fighting with the evil cultivator earlier, I saw how focused your gaze was, you were frequently nodding your head as you watched, so I guess you must have had some {color=#d0380a}Insight{/color}.
不过对功法的进一步掌握，往往需要大量的时间，所以功法的选择与学习，需要慎之又慎。可以博采众长，但切不可东一榔头西一棒子，到头来一事无成。¤However, further mastery of Techniques can often take up a lot of time, so one must carefully choose which ones should be studied carefully. It is possible to learn everything you have on hand, but it is even more important to have a clear goal in mind, the right hand must always know what the left is doing otherwise both will end up with nothing.
对思绪进行感悟，可以提高对大道的理解。而思绪亦有高下之分，越是稀有的思绪，感悟大道的过程越高效，顶尖的思绪乃是可遇不可求的。¤Understanding insight helps one become more in touch with Dao, There are also tiers of insights, the rarer a insight, the more efficient the process of perceiving Dao.
不错，其中要领你已知晓便好，真是孺子可教，后生可畏，你当勤勤恳恳，必是前途无量。¤Excellent, It is good you know the essentials, it is as they say a youngster's abilities must be respected, for though inexperienced, the younger generations will surpass us in time, If you continue being this diligent in training your prospects shall be boundless.
进入客房，感受着聚灵阵缓缓运转，你在木榻上盘腿静坐下来。闭目垂帘，调息静心，东石谷的繁华、坊市的喧闹、初入修仙界的兴奋皆悄然淡去。¤As you enter the guest room, you feel the Spiritual Formation slowly running, you sit down cross-legged on the wooden couch. With your eyes closed and the curtains down, you meditate and empty your thoughts, the bustling of East Stone Valley, the noise from it's marketplace and the excitement of entering the immortal world for the first time, all quietly begin to fade away.
有时你会获取多种感悟，你当慎重辨别轻重缓急。莫要因思绪庸微而忽略，莫要因思绪妙甚而贪图。¤Sometimes you will gain multiple insights, and you should be careful to prioritise them. Don't ignore them because they are trivial, and don't covet them because they are wonderful.
在这独处僻静之处，你能做的，无非是闭关修炼、领悟神通功法、突破功法、感悟思绪。他们各有条件，耗时也各有差别，你要好好注意安排。到二月赴约之前你可以择一二而行。¤In this solitary and secluded place, all you can do is to self isolate and cultivate, comprehend divine powers, breakthrough techniques, and feel your thoughts. They each have their own conditions and take different amounts of time, so you should take care to schedule them. You can choose one or two before you go to your appointment in February.
无论行为如何，都会{color=#d0380a}每月{/color}按主修功法获得修为，而闭关选择{color=#d0380a}修炼{/color}行为时则可以受到诸项加成，修为获取效率更高。\n¤Regardless of what you do, you will gain cultivation {color=#d0380a}every month{/color} from your chosen major technique, while you can receive all bonuses when you choose to {color=#d0380a}cultivate{/color} in seclusion, and gain cultivation more efficiently. \n
无论是想战无不胜，还是想提高对大道的理解，都需博采众长。多学习学习总是好的，书到用时方恨少，说不定哪天哪个不起眼的神通就能救你于危难之间，¤Whether you want to triumph in every battle or to improve your understanding of Dao, one needs to study a healthy mix of everything. Learning more is always good, for knowledge is power and on the battlefield when it comes time to apply that knowledge you may regret not acquiring enough of it, you never know one day you may be able to save yourself from a crisis with a humble skill.
{color=#d0380a}领悟{/color}就是对神通功法进行研习。它们是修仙路上安身立命的最大依仗，神通功法皆乃各修仙界前辈的心血结晶，领悟它们能以最高的效率提升对大道的感悟。¤{color=#d0380a}Comprehension {/color} is to study the Divine Powers. They are the greatest source of support on the path to immortality. Divine Powers are the culmination of many cultivation seniors. To comprehend them will greatly improve your understanding of the greater Dao.
老爷爷说到这里，似乎有些伤感，突然沉默下来，向你挥了挥手，示意你自行安排时间，你小心地把铁剑收好，再次盘腿静坐下来。¤At this point, the old grandfather seems a little sad and suddenly falls silent, waving his hand to you, indicating that you should make your own arrangements for your time. You carefully put the iron sword away and sit down again in meditation with your legs crossed.
请单击右侧{color=#d0380a}闭关{/color}按钮选择行动。\r\n¤Please click on the {color=#d0380a}Closure{/color} button on the right to select an action. \r\n
合理搭配功法神通，在战斗时有奇效，你虽初入修仙界，但脑袋还算灵光，好好推敲化演，想必能有属于自己的搭配。¤A reasonable combination of skills and techniques will produce surprising results on the battlefield. You may be new to the immortal world, but you have a good head on your shoulders. I don't think you will have trouble finding skills and techniques that are right for you.
不打扰你了，老夫也有些乏了，接下来的时间你自行安排便好。¤I'm not going to bother you anymore, I'm a bit tired, so you can make your own arrangements for the rest of the day.
{color=#d0380a}感悟{/color}即是对获得的思绪进行消化。思绪不在大小，积少成多聚沙成塔。处处留心皆学问，切记莫要好高骛远。\n¤{color=#d0380a}Sensation{/color} is the digestion of the thoughts gained. It's not about the size of the thought, towers are built brick by brick. Everywhere you look you learn, remember not to be overly ambitious. \n
要记住，修仙界中，灵石、神通功法固然非常重要，但对于茫茫众生而言，最重要的则是{color=#d0380a}时间{/color}与{color=#d0380a}寿元{/color}！¤Remember, in the cultivation world, spirit stones and techniques are of course extremely important, but for the vast number of beings, the most important thing is {color=#d0380a}time{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Lifespan{/color}!
无论是闭关修炼、还是外出历练，无论是拜师学艺，还是自己摸索，你所做的一切，都各有利弊，唯有{color=#d0380a}寿元{/color}是实打实地流逝了，时光如梭，光阴似水，你要仔细权衡，合理安排，才能觅得长生啊。¤Whether it's closed-door training, or going out on an adventure, whether it's learning from a teacher, or figuring it out on your own, everything you do has its pros and cons, except for {color=#d0380a}Lifespan{/color} which is literally running out. Time marches on, and flows away from us like a river, you have to weigh it carefully and arrange it wisely in order to have a long life.
还有什么不明白的吗？¤Is there anything else you don't understand?
既然如此，那老夫便再多唠叨几句。¤In that case, I will harp on some more.
哦？不错，看来你从刚才的观战当中，获得了一些关于剑道的{color=#d0380a}思绪{/color}，真是不简单哪。¤Oh? You seem to have gained some {color=#d0380a}thought about the way of the sword{/color}from watching the battle just now.
{color=#d0380a}思绪{/color}嘛，通常是经年累月灵光一现时，偶有所得，亦或是与人论道时，有所收获。¤{color=#d0380a}Insight{/color} are usually something that comes to you over the years, or when you have a discussion with someone.
{color=#d0380a}突破{/color}便是对已习得的功法进行进一步精进。能显著提升战斗时的效能，熟能生巧，精进功法也会不断地提升对该大道的感悟。¤A {color=#d0380a}breakthrough{/color} is a further refinement of an already acquired technique. It can significantly improve your effectiveness in battle, and practice makes perfect, refining your techniques will also continue to improve your understanding of that specific greater Dao.
{color=#d0380a}修炼{/color}便是专心致志运转主修功法，以最大效率地获得修为。心境越高、环境灵气越浓郁，效果越好，日久天长之下，会对运转的功法产生思绪。\r\n¤{color=#d0380a}Cultivation{/color} means concentrating on running your main cultivation technique to gain cultivation with maximum efficiency. The higher the state of mind and the more dense the environment's Qi, the better the effect will be. Over time, one will generate thoughts about the cultivation technique being run. \r\n
醒醒，是时候去{color=#d0380a}伴月楼{/color}和你的新朋友碰头了。¤Wake up, it's time to meet your new friend at the {color=#d0380a}Moon House{/color}.
都已经到二月了...可我还有好多想领悟的功法，要是再多一点时间……¤It's already February... But I still have so many Techniques that I want to master, if only I had a little more time ......
修仙都是经年累月之功，不差那几日枯坐。¤Cultivating immortality is an effort that takes years and months, missing a few days won't set you back.
听老头子一句劝。人生苦短，不先去尘世里摸爬滚打，历练{color=#d0380a}心境{/color}，光凭几卷功法就想出世成仙，那才是缘木求鱼。¤Listen to this old fool's word of advice. Life is short, if you don't experiece the hardships of this earthly plane, you won't be able to expand your {color=#d0380a}mind{/color}, a few volumes of Techniques to become immortal? Would be like climbing a tree to catch fish, an impossibility.
好了好了老头，自从我把你拔出来，这怕是第一百句劝了……（倒霉……我到底是拔了一把剑还是个话匣子）¤Fine Fine old man, ever since I pulled you out, this might be you've 100th lesson so far...... (i'm so unlucky ...... never thought pulling out a sword meant having to deal with a chatterbox too)
不过{color=#d0380a}拍卖会{/color}也确实快开始了，是该去那{color=#d0380a}伴月楼{/color}与倪兄碰头了。¤But {color=#d0380a}the auction{/color} will really start soon, it might be time to go to the {color=#d0380a}Moon House{/color}and meet up with Brother Ni .
你在王府内仔细探查了几番，并没有再发现什么特别的事情，便打道回府了...¤You explored the palace carefully, and found nothing special, so you went back to the palace...
你在府内四处查看了一番，没有发现什么特殊的情况...就在你准备打道回府时，一道奇怪的波动引起了你的注意。¤You looked around in the mansion and found nothing special... Just when you were about to go back to the mansion, a strange fluctuation caught your attention.
（可了不得，宁王府的死物竟然也能开口说话吗！）¤(It's amazing, can the dead thing in Prince Ning's Mansion even speak!)
此后你二人便是供奉的贴身小厮了，一定仔细伺候。¤From now on, you two will be Guest Elder's servants. Take good care of him/her.
见过供奉，小的名唤软玉。¤Guest Elder, call me Nephrite.
见过供奉，小的名唤温香。¤Guest Elder, call me Wenxiang.
（这宁王府起名倒是别致，嘿嘿嘿...就是不知道此女样貌如何）¤(The name of Prince Ning’s Mansion is unique, hehehe...I just don’t know what this woman looks like)
这不就是上次在酒宴上遇到的那名美妾么。¤Isn't this the beautiful concubine I met at the banquet last time.
你还没从困惑中恢复，就见两个衣着朴素的男子从管事身后走出。¤You haven't recovered from the confusion, you saw two plainly dressed men walking out from behind the steward.
这么说了，那宁王难道是因为修炼了这《枯木功》，才变成了这幅人不人鬼不鬼的模样...？¤That said, is it because King Na Ning has cultivated this Withered Wood Technique that he has become such a person, not a ghost or a ghost...?
按照惯例，供奉初入王府之时宁王会下放赠礼，小的已经把“金银财宝”和“软玉温香”都给带来了，请供奉大人随意挑选。¤According to the usual practice, when first becoming a Guest Elder of the king, Ning King will give gifts when he first enters the palace. I have already brought both the gold and silver treasures, Guest Elder. Please choose freely.
你在府内四处逛了逛，奇怪的是并没有见到府内的其他供奉，莫非大家都在闭门修炼...？¤You wandered around in the mansion. The strange thing is that you didn't see other Guest Elders in the mansion. Could it be that everyone is practicing behind closed doors...?
{firstname}供奉刚来王府，想见见其他同道也属正常，不过日后也有的是机会。¤Guest Elder {firstname} has just come to the palace, and it is normal to want to meet other colleagues, but there will be opportunities in the future.
你还没从震惊中恢复，就见两个其貌不扬的女子从管事身后走出。¤You haven't recovered from the shock, you saw two ugly women walking out from behind the steward.
你放下玉简，又在房内四处检查了一遍，没有发现其它的线索，便小心翼翼地关上房门，回到了自己的住所。¤You put down the jade slip and checked around in the room again, and found no other clues, so you closed the door carefully and returned to your residence.
是禁制的波动...¤It's forbidden fluctuation...
这不是{FirstName}供奉么，原来你走到这儿来了...小的正到处找您呢。¤Isn't this Guest Elder {FirstName}? So you came here... The little one is looking for you everywhere.
不说这些了，差点耽误了正事，小的这次来找你是另有其事。¤Don't talk about it, I almost missed business. The young one came to see you this time for something else.
此后你二人便是供奉的贴身婢女了，一定仔细伺候。¤From now on, you two will be Guest Elder's personal servant girls, take care of him/her carefully.
供奉初来王府，当然要先享乐一番才是，不然岂不是我们待客不周。¤It's Guest Elder's first visit to the palace, of course, we must first have fun, otherwise it is not because we have not treated the guests well.
你一头雾水地带着两人回到了自己的居所...¤You took the two of them back to your home in a daze...
你收敛气息，往波动传来的方向走去。这是一间并不起眼的普通厢房，此时房门虚掩着，似乎刚刚有什么人打破禁制进入了房间。¤You restrained your breath and walked in the direction of the wave. This is an unremarkable ordinary wing room. At this time, the door is empty. It seems that someone has just broken the restriction and entered the room.
你刚一推开房门，只见一道白影从你眼前一闪，还没等你看清来人是谁，便被一股巨力向后推开好几步，险些跌倒在地。¤As soon as you opened the door, you saw a white shadow flashing in front of your eyes. Before you could see who came, you were pushed a few steps back by a huge force and almost fell to the ground.
软玉温香，还不速速向供奉问好！¤Nephrite and Fragrant, hurry up and say hello to the Guest Elder!
王府内不见踪影的其他供奉，那日偶然撞见的神秘白影，还有宁王修炼的恐怖功法，你隐约觉得这些事件之间另有关联...¤Other Guest Elders were not visible in the palace, the mysterious white shadows that happened by chance that day, and the terrifying techniques practiced by Ning King. You vaguely feel that these events are otherwise related...
地阶木系功法，修炼后虽可延寿，但体内筋脉也会干瘪堵塞，并不利于修为进境...炼至大成后，七情六欲皆已麻木，形体更会干瘪的像是将死的枯木一般恐怖。¤Earth-level wood system practice, although it can prolong life after practicing, but the veins and veins in the body will become dry and clogged, which is not conducive to the advancement of the cultivation base... After practicing to the great level, the seven emotions and six desires are numb, and the body will become more dry and shriveled. The dead wood is as horrible.
你在王府内瞎逛了几圈，远远地便看到一名女子从廊道走过。她形色匆匆，还频频左右张望，看上去颇为警觉...¤You wandered around the palace a few times, and you saw a woman walking by the corridor from a distance. She was in a hurry and looked around frequently, looking quite alert...
莫非是刚刚逃走的那人留下的？¤Could it be left by the person who just ran away?
有意思，这里看起来并不像什么重要的地方，竟然被特意设下了禁制防护。¤Interestingly, it doesn't look like an important place here, but it has been specially set up for prohibition and protection.
王府不会限制各位供奉的行动，想来其他的供奉都已外出，留在府内的也可能在闭关修炼吧。¤The Royal Mansion will not restrict the actions of Guest Elders. If you want to come, other worships have already gone out. Those who stay in the mansion may also be practicing in retreat.
你捡起玉简，用神识探查了一番。¤You picked up the jade slip and probed it with your spiritual sense.
枯...木...功...¤Wither...wood...gong...
你表面上仍是在府中闲逛玩乐，却暗中更仔细地观察了一番，可惜再没有能遇到什么特别值得注意的事情...¤On the surface, you are still hanging out in the mansion for fun, but you secretly observed it more closely, but unfortunately you haven't encountered anything particularly noteworthy...
等你再向四周张望时，周围已经空无一人...¤When you look around again, there is no one around you...
也不知是何人这么大胆，竟敢硬闯高手如云的宁王府。¤I don't know who is so bold and dare to break into the master Ning Palace.
你不想因为一件和自己没什么关系的事情惹上一身骚，便连忙打道回府了。¤You don't want to get into trouble because of something that has nothing to do with you, so you hurried back home.
见过供奉，奴婢名唤金银。¤Guest Elder, and the servants and maidservants call for gold and silver.
真是可怕的功法...想来也只有那些无缘结丹之人，才会靠着这种功法苟延残喘多活一些年吧...¤It's a terrible exercise... I think that only those who have no chance of forming a pill will survive on this exercise for a few more years...
金银财宝，还不速速向供奉问好！¤Gold and silver treasures, hurry up and say hello to the Guest Elder!
管事脸色一变，随即又呵呵的笑了起来。¤The steward's face changed, and then he laughed again.
一阵七绕八拐以后，她终于走到府内一处极不起眼的住处，推开门走了进去。你收敛气息，悄悄走到屋外，听到房间里传来了两人交谈的声音...¤After a while, she finally walked to a very inconspicuous residence in the mansion, opened the door and walked in. You restrained your breath, walked quietly outside the room, and heard the sound of two people talking in the room. ..
算了，被设下禁制的地方定然是府内重要之处，若是被人发现我在附近，可就说不清楚了...¤Forget it, the place where the ban is set must be an important part of the mansion. If someone finds me nearby, I can't explain it clearly...
见过供奉，奴婢名唤财宝。¤Guest Elder, and the names of slaves and maids call for treasure.
你走进屋内，这里的摆设和府内其它的厢房并无不同之处，只有一枚落在地上的玉简显得颇为突兀。¤When you walk into the house, the furnishings here are no different from other wing rooms in the mansion. Only a jade slip on the ground seems quite abrupt.
不错...日后若有要事，便可通过这传音符和我联系了。¤Yes... if you have something important in the future, you can contact me through this sound transmission.
看情形这就是传闻之中的龙脉之力。¤Judging from the situation, this is the rumored power of the dragon veins.
九玄大圣的传承？¤The inheritance of the Nine Profound Sage?
这片龙鳞应是龙族先祖之遗物，有机会可以交还龙族。¤This piece of dragon scale should be the relic of the ancestors of the dragon clan, and there is a chance to return it to the dragon clan.
不愧是上古龙族，当年所修的龙脉今日竟还有复苏的迹象，这等要事还是尽快回复龙族一声吧。¤As expected of the ancient dragon clan, the dragon veins that were cultivated in those days still show signs of recovery today, so let’s reply to the dragon clan as soon as possible.
传闻上古龙族掌握一条龙脉用于龙族修炼特殊地脉，看这地脉喷涌的程度，应该即将主脉出世届时有可能上古龙宫一并出世。¤It is rumored that the ancient dragon clan mastered a dragon vein for the dragon clan to cultivate special earth veins. Judging from the degree of this earth vein spewing, it should be possible that the Ancient Dragon Palace will be born together when the main vein is born.
突然龙鳞光芒大方，从龙鳞中一阵男声：“吾乃龙族太上长老九玄，今日我族为无耻鲲族所暗算，此番大劫也不知我龙族能否挺过，你作为我龙族后裔这《九龙引雷决》就传与你，切记大仇不可忘，传承不可断。”¤Suddenly, the dragon scales radiated generously, and a male voice came from the dragon scales: I am the Dragon Clan's Supreme Elder Jiuxuan, today my clan is plotted against the shameless Kun Clan, I don't know if my Dragon Clan can survive this catastrophe, you are my Dragon Clan. The descendants of this Nine Dragons Thundering Judgment will be passed on to you, remember that the great feud cannot be forgotten, and the inheritance cannot be interrupted.
眼前是一气眼，龙脉之气喷涌而出。¤In front of him is a single eye, and the air of dragon veins spews out.
一片黯淡的逆鳞悬浮于空中。¤A bleak inverse scale was suspended in the air.
突然龙鳞光芒大方，从龙鳞中一阵男声：“吾乃龙族太上长老九婴，今日我族为无耻鲲族所暗算，此番大劫也不知我龙族能否挺过，道友即为我族客卿还希望将此物归还族中直系。”¤Suddenly the dragon scales radiated generously, and a male voice came from the dragon scales: I am the Dragon Clan's Supreme Elder Jiu Ying, today my clan is plotted by the shameless Kun clan, I don't know if my dragon clan can survive this catastrophe, my fellow Daoist is My family' guest also hopes to return this thing to the direct line of the family.
突然龙鳞光芒大方，从龙鳞中一阵男声：“吾乃龙族太上长老九玄，今日我族为无耻鲲族所暗算，此番大劫也不知我龙族能否挺过，你作为我龙族后裔这《真龙九变》与《真龙血怒》就传与你，切记大仇不可忘，传承不可断。”¤Suddenly, the dragon scales shined brightly, and a male voice came from the dragon scales: I am Jiuxuan, the supreme elder of the dragon clan. Today, my clan is plotted by the shameless Kun clan. I don't know if my dragon clan can survive this catastrophe. You are my dragon clan. The descendants of True Dragon Nine Changes and True Dragon Blood Fury will be passed on to you, remember that the great feud cannot be forgotten, and the inheritance cannot be broken.
你感受到其中的波动很是熟悉。¤The fluctuations you feel are familiar.
龙脉之力？¤The power of dragon veins?
周围四溢着某种能量，但你并不能吸收调用。¤There is some kind of energy all around, but you can't absorb the invocation.
看来这一缕残魂，认为我是龙族后裔，将龙族传承传与我。¤It seems that this remnant of the soul thinks that I am a descendant of the dragon race and passed on the inheritance of the dragon race to me.
话毕，龙鳞冲出一光团直冲你的识海。¤After speaking, the dragon scales rushed out of a light group and rushed straight to your sea of ​​consciousness.
周围喷涌的龙脉之力向你汇聚而来，被你吸收一空。¤The power of the dragon veins gushing around you gathers and is absorbed by you.
看来你{xiaozi}还真是龙族后裔，竟能吸收这龙脉之力。¤It seems that you {xiaozi} are really descendants of the dragon race, and you can absorb the power of this dragon vein.
突然，周围喷涌的龙脉之力向你汇聚而来，被你吸收一空。¤Suddenly, the power of the dragon veins spewing around you gathered towards you and was completely absorbed by you.
商队出行时会避开相对危险的乱流期，即每年的三、四月与九、十月。因此，大多数船队都会在宁州停靠半年左右再返航。¤Caravans will avoid the relatively dangerous turbulence period when they travel, that is, March, April, September, and October each year. Therefore, most of the fleet will stop in Ning Province for about half a year before returning.
请师妹通过传送阵返回星河剑派。¤Sister, please return to the Galaxy Sword Sect through the teleportation array.
宗门大比既已结束，请各位弟子随我通过传送阵返回星河剑派。¤Since the Zongmen Grand Competition is over, please follow me back to the Galaxy Sword Sect through the teleportation array.
{FirstName}{shidi}，恭喜你又一次拿到宗门大比的魁首。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, congratulations on getting the leader of the Zongmen Grand Competition again.
作为这次宗门大比的第一，你可以自行选择拜入我派任意一位长老门下,我现在便带你前往大殿。¤As the number one in this sect competition, you can choose to visit any elder Our Sect, and I will take you to the main hall now.
{FirstName}{shidi}，恭喜你夺得本次大比的第一。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, congratulations on winning the first place in this competition.
我...我没事...¤I...I'm fine...
以你现在的修为，再加上这次大比又得了一颗筑基丹，是时候好好准备一下筑基了。¤With your current cultivation, and the Foundation Pill won from this Grand Competition, it is time to properly prepare for your Foundation breakthrough.
白露红着脸跑下了擂台。¤Bai Lu blushed and ran off the ring.
咳咳咳...可惜，离第一名只差一步...¤Cough cough cough...a pity, only one step away from the first place...
白露师妹，你没事吧？¤Sister Bailu, are you okay?
{FirstName}{shidi}，我派长老一般都在宗门大殿之中，普通弟子是不能随便出入的。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, my elders are usually in the sect hall, ordinary disciples can't come and go casually.
{FirstName}供奉，请随我来。¤Guest Elder {FirstName}, please follow me.
{FirstName}供奉，准备好参加比试了么？¤Guest Elder {FirstName}provider, ready to participate in the competition?
不错，我也是曾经听师尊说起过这件事。据说千年前御剑门因为私通魔门，而被宁州各大门派围攻。¤Yes, I also heard Master talk about this. It is said that a thousand years ago, Sword Driving Sect was besieged by various sects in Ning Province because of fornication with the Demon faction.
再加上几个门派间也都是{color=#d0380a}貌合神离{/color}，真要遇到什么危险，大家还是以各自门派的利益为重。如此一来，每一届的猎魔试炼确实都会有人命丧其中。¤The fact is that there are several sects that are {color=#d0380a}seemingly at odds with each other{/color}, and when it comes to any real danger, everyone still puts the interests of their respective sects first. This way, every year, people do die in the Demon Hunt Trials.
其实能够结成六、七品金丹的，已是数一数二的佼佼者，我派数位长老之中能够有此等机遇者亦不多见。¤Actually, those who can form 6th or 7th grade Golden Cores are already among the best, and it is rare for me to send several elders who can have such opportunities.
天魔眼中那些普通的下等魔倒是不难对付，但如果深入到最{color=#d0380a}中心区域{/color}，那些有数百年修为的魔物就不是普通筑基期弟子能单独应付的了。¤Those ordinary inferior demons in the eyes of the Heavenly Demons are not difficult to deal with, but if you go deeper into the most {color=#d0380a}central area{/color}, those demons with hundreds of years of cultivation are not something that ordinary Foundation Establishment disciples can handle alone.
天魔眼？¤Devil's Eye?
不过{shidi}如今修为尚浅，还是等突破到筑基期以后再去参与吧。¤However, {shidi} is still shallow at the moment, so let's wait until the breakthrough reaches the foundation building stage before participating.
你将自己在御剑门中所见一一说来，但特意省略了剑灵被锈剑吸收的事。¤You talked about what you saw in the Imperial Sword Gate one by one, but deliberately omitted the fact that the sword spirit was absorbed by the rust sword.
魔气......要说这魔气充溢之地，在宁州恐怕就只有{color=#d0380a}天魔眼{/color}了。¤Devil energy... if you say that this place is full of devil energy, in Ning Province I am afraid there is only {color=#d0380a}the eye of the devil{/color}.
你将{color=#d0380a}灵气消散的飞剑{/color}交给大师姐，并将自己在路上遭到剑灵袭击的事悉数告知。¤You hand over the flying sword{/color} with the dissipated spirit of {color=#d0380a} to the master sister, and tell you all about your being attacked by the sword spirit on the road.
如今你已筑基，确实应该好好了解一下未来{color=#d0380a}结丹{/color}的相关事宜。¤Now that you have built the foundation, you really should take a good look at the future {color=#d0380a}consolidation{/color} related matters.
{FirstName}长老有何吩咐？¤What does Elder {FirstName} want?
这柄残剑的造型极为独特，如果我没有记错的话，这应该是千年前覆灭的御剑门弟子配剑。¤The shape of this remnant sword is extremely unique. If I remember correctly, this should be the sword used by a disciple of the Imperial Sword Sect that was destroyed thousands of years ago.
哎快来快来，那个{shidi}就是......（低声耳语）¤Hey, come on, that {shidi} is... (whispering)
{shidi}，我们马上就要前往天魔眼了，要一起出发么？¤{shidi}, we are going to the Eye of the Demon, shall we set off together?
这些下等魔短期内虽然不足为虑，但若是放任不管，也会带来不少祸端。因此，宁州修士们约定俗成，每隔二十年会打开一次天魔眼外的禁制，令修为相当的门派弟子及散修前去清缴。¤Although these inferior demons are not a concern in the short term, if they are left alone, they will also bring a lot of disaster. Therefore, the Ning Province cultivators agreed to open the restrictions outside the eyes of the demon once every twenty years, and make the cultivation base. Quite a few disciples and independent cultivators went to pay.
没想到此行竟如此凶险，还好{shidi}你能平安归来。¤I didn't expect this trip to be so dangerous, but fortunately {shidi} you can return safely.
这灵核这是各大门派争夺的一种重要资源，我们也不例外。所以你收集到的所有灵核都可以在宗门内部换取其它你需要的东西。¤This spiritual core is an important resource that various sects compete for, and we are no exception. So all the spiritual cores you collect can be exchanged for other things you need inside the sect.
结丹之时，压缩的灵气越多，最终成丹的品质也越高。高品阶的金丹不但能够改善体质，还可以提升修炼速度，甚至改变灵根。¤When forming a pill, the more auras that are compressed, the higher the quality of the final pill. High-ranking gold pill can not only improve the physical fitness, but also increase the speed of cultivation, and even change the spiritual root.
这剑身的形状，莫非是...¤The shape of the sword is...
下次可莫要再逞莽夫之勇，一定量力而行。¤Next time, don't try to be brave and do what you can.
总之，剩下的事情便交给我吧，我会与师尊商议后再做处理的。¤In short, leave the rest to me, and I will deal with it after discussing with my master.
当你修为达到筑基巅峰之时，体内灵气便会达到饱和，而结丹便是一个不断压缩灵气，最终凝聚成金丹的过程。¤When your cultivation reaches the peak of foundation building, the aura in your body will reach saturation, and pill formation is a process of continuously compressing the aura and finally condensing it into a Golden Core.
你别看几位长老们平时嘴上不说，但心里对这些虚名还是有几分看重的。{shidi}若是能在猎魔试炼中表现出色，说不定还能得到门派内部的嘉奖呢。¤Don't look at the few elders who usually don't talk about them, but they still value these false names in their hearts. If {shidi} can perform well in the trial of demon hunting, maybe he will be rewarded from within the school. .
参与猎魔试炼的都是我们宁州五大门派的年轻弟子，自然是要争出个先后。¤All the young disciples of our Ning Province Five Major Sects who participated in the demon hunting trial have to fight for priority.
据说是因为天魔眼的封印并不稳固，因此要避免太过剧烈的灵气波动。¤It is said that the seal of the eyes of the demon is not stable, so it is necessary to avoid too violent aura fluctuations.
所谓丹分九品，结丹之难已远甚于筑基，若想结九品金丹更是难上加难。所以大部分修士在闭关突破前，都会尽可能收集一些可以增加{color=#d0380a}结丹几率{/color}的丹药和秘术。¤The so-called nine-ranked pill, the difficulty of forming a pill is far more difficult than building a foundation. If you want to form a nine-rank Golden Core, it is even more difficult. Therefore, most cultivators will collect as much as possible before breaking through the retreat to increase {color =#d0380a}Pills and occult techniques with the chance of forming alchemy{/color}.
{shidi}虽然已入门拜师，但这筑基丹也是极为稀有的宝贝。未来{shidi}筑基突破时若能服下几颗，可以大大提高筑基成功的概率。¤Although {shidi} has already become a inner disciple, this Foundation Pill is still extremely precious. In the future, if {shidi} can take a few of them when breaking through, it can greatly increase the probability of success.
至于结丹的秘术则更为珍贵，我派多年来也未曾收集到太多。¤As for the secret technique of pill formation, it is even more precious, and I have not collected much in many years.
虽然我们化尘教排名差些，但却没有弟子在魔物手下丧命。¤Although our Huchen Cult ranks poorly, none of the disciples died under the monsters.
{shidi}，上次在天魔眼中受的伤可养好了？¤{shidi}, can you heal the wound in the eyes of the demon last time?
哎呦喂，你可小点声，别被人家听见！¤Oh hello, you can keep your voice down, don't be heard by others!
御剑门的遗址正在九嶷山，不过这遗迹已经被我们五大门派用禁制封印了起来，只有持有信物之人，才能进入那里。¤The ruins of Imperial Sword Sect are in Jiuyi Mountain, but the ruins have been sealed by our five major sects. Only those with tokens can enter there.
{shidi}，何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤{shidi}, what's the matter? {w}{w=0.5}
沾染魔气...这让我想起了千年前覆灭的御剑门。¤Contaminated with demonic energy... it reminds me of the Sword Driving Sect that was destroyed thousands years ago.
你说这剑灵沾染了魔气，而我看这残剑的形状也与传闻中御剑门弟子的配件颇为相似，这其中一定有什么关联。¤You said that the sword spirit was tainted with devilish energy, and I think the shape of the remnant sword is quite similar to the rumored accessories of the Imperial Sword Sect disciple. There must be something related to this.
御剑门？¤Imperial Sword Sect?
{shidi}，最近修为可有长进？¤{shidi}, has the cultivation base improved recently?
你先去{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}挑选入门功法，再去{color=#d0380a}神兵阁{/color}挑选符器，之后回来找我。¤You first go to {color=#d0380a} Tibetan Scripture Pavilion{/color} to select the entry technique, then {color=#d0380a} Shenbing Pavilion{/color} to select the talisman, and then come back to me.
这剑灵虽然已经被你消灭了，但此事细想仍然有些蹊跷，说不定真有魔道在背后搞鬼。¤Although this sword spirit has been wiped out by you, the matter is still a bit weird when you think about it. Maybe there is a magic way behind it.
见过师祖。¤Well met Master.
好，若是有要事，除闭关之外如无意外我会随时回复{shidi}的。¤Well, if there is something important, I will reply {shidi} at any time if there are no accidents other than the retreat.
{shidi}，御剑门之事你可探查清楚了？¤{shidi}, can you find out about the Sword Driving Sect?
此次能战胜地魔你功不可没，不愧是我们化尘教的弟子！¤This time you are indispensable for being able to fight against the Demon. You are indeed a disciple of our Chen Aeonic Sands Temple!
每一次的猎魔试炼都会有玄道宗的长老亲自镇守，所以想要隐藏修为参加是不可能做到的。¤Every demon hunting trial will be guarded by the elders of the Mystic Dao Sect personally, so it is impossible to hide the cultivation base and participate in it.
{shidi}，我担心御剑门遗址可能发生了什么变动。此事目前还只是我们的猜测，暂时先不要声张。¤{shidi}, I am worried about what may have changed in the Imperial Sword Sect ruins. This matter is still our guess, so let's not say anything for now.
什么？！那个传说中被三宗大师兄一齐救下的名人？¤What?! The legendary celebrity who was saved by the three masters?
{shidi}，此去御剑门可有什么收获？¤{shidi}, what can I gain from going to Imperial Sword Sect here?
这御剑门建在何处？¤Where is this Imperial Sword Sect built?
那是自然，上一届的猎魔试炼便是由我带着其他筑基期的师弟师妹一起参加的。¤That's natural. The last demon hunting trial was attended by me and other juniors and sisters from the foundation building period.
天魔眼中的下等魔本身没有灵智，但被击溃后体内魔气便会消散，掉落的{color=#d0380a}灵核{/color}是一种很稀有的布阵材料。¤The inferior demon in the eyes of the demon has no intelligence, but after being defeated, the demon energy in the body will dissipate. The fallen {color=#d0380a}spiritual core{/color} is a very rare array material.
结丹时所需要消耗的灵气数量极为恐怖，只靠平日储备的灵气自然没有十足把握。因此大部分人都会选择在突破前服用丹药，增加自己结丹的成功率。¤The amount of aura needed to condense a pill is extremely terrifying. Naturally, it is not entirely possible to rely on the aura that is stored on a daily basis. Therefore, most people will choose to take the pill before breaking through to increase their success rate of pill formation.
本来等{shidi}你突破到筑基期后，也会知道此事。既然你问起，那我便提前告诉你吧。¤Originally, after {shidi} you broke through to the foundation building period, you would know about this. Since you asked, I will tell you in advance.
{shidi}，何事？¤{shidi}, what's the matter?
这是可以进入御剑门遗址的信物，你拿着它，替我去御剑门勘察一番。若真有异变，我们得赶紧通知师尊与各位长老知晓。¤This is a token that can enter the Imperial Sword Sect site. Take it and go to the Imperial Sword Sect for me to investigate. If there is any change, we must quickly notify the master and the elders to know.
你走到一个安静的角落，盘腿坐下，很快进入了心境空明的状态...¤You walked to a quiet corner, sat down cross-legged, and quickly entered a state of emptiness...
{shidi}，门派大比就要开始了，快来登记吧。¤{shidi}, the martial art competition is about to begin, come and register.
请{FirstName}{LastName}上台比试！¤Please {FirstName}{LastName} come to the stage to compete!
今年的大比真是精彩。¤This year's competition is really exciting.
你从观战中又得到了一些新的感悟，修为{color=#d0380a}+1000{/color}，心境{color=#d0380a}+1{/color}¤You have gained some new insights from watching the battle, your cultivation base is {color=#d0380a}+1000{/color}, and your state of mind is {color=#d0380a}+1{/color}
你走到擂台旁，观看其他师兄弟间的比试。大比之上，众人纷纷拿出自己的看家本领，法术横飞，打得好不热闹。¤You walk to the ring and watch the competition between other brothers and sisters. Above the big competition, everyone has used their own housekeeping skills, spells flying wildly, and the fight is so lively.
大战在即，亦能保持心境平和，心境{color=#d0380a}+3{/color}¤The battle is imminent, and you can maintain peace of mind. {color=#d0380a}+3{/color}
好了，这是你的签，你拿好到台下候着，等轮到你上台比试了，会有人来叫你的。¤Okay, this is your sign. You take it to the stage and wait. When it's your turn to take the stage to compete, someone will call you.
（还有一段时间才能轮到我，现在做什么好呢？）¤(It's still a while before my turn, what should I do now?)
我们奇珍阁专售各类稀有的特殊材料，道友看看有什么需要的？¤Our Qizheng Pavilion specializes in selling all kinds of rare and special materials. What do you need?
要与我切磋一番么？¤Would you like to discuss with me?
你发现自己囊中羞涩，甚至没有足够的灵石用来交“过路费”，只能转身离去。¤You find that you are broke, and you don't even have enough spirit stones to pay for the tolls, you can only turn around and leave.
你佯装离开后以神识掩盖气息，准备潜入城中。¤After you pretend to leave, cover up your breath with divine consciousness, ready to sneak into the city.
你在海上早已臭名昭著，来来往往巡逻的守卫便是为了防止你这样的邪修。若直接上岛，必定会被拦下...¤You have long been notorious at sea. The guards patrolling here and there are to prevent evil cultivator like you. If you go directly to the island, you will definitely be stopped...
你将一个装着灵石的储物袋丢向城门附近的修士。¤You throw a storage bag with spirit stones to the cultivator near the city gate.
在你自以为即将得手时，一股强大的神识从你的位置扫过。紧接着几个守卫向你所在的方位赶来。¤When you thought you were about to succeed, a powerful sense of God swept across from your position. Then a few guards rushed to where you were.
就在你即将进入时，一股强大的神识扫过，却径直掠过你向其他位置而去。¤Just as you were about to enter, a powerful sacred sense swept across, but it swept past you to another location.
你以神识掩盖气息，准备潜入城中。¤You hide your breath with your divine consciousness, ready to sneak into the city.
他也是很自然的将储物袋收入怀中，然后向守卫点了点头。后者也不作理会，一脸平淡的放你入城了。¤He also naturally put the storage bag in his arms, and then nodded to the guard. The latter ignored it and let you into the city with a plain face.
{xiaozi}，城内大阵被触发了！快离开！¤{xiaozi}, the big formation in the city has been triggered! Leave now!
{xiaozi}！你被发现了！快脱离锁定范围！¤{xiaozi}! You have been found! Get out of the locked area soon!
就在你即将进入城中时，一股强大的神识扫过，但只是稍稍停顿便掠过你向其他位置而去。¤Just as you were about to enter the city, a powerful sacred sense swept across, but it only paused for a while before passing you to another location.
在魏无极出声的同时，你运起遁术迅速远离，总算是避免了一场无畏的大战。¤While Wei Wuji made a sound, you quickly moved away from the escape technique, finally avoiding a fearless battle.
你运起敛息术，自身散发的神识波动随着功法的效果被最大限度的降低了。¤When you use the Breath-Containing Technique, the fluctuations in the consciousness that you radiate are minimized with the effect of the technique.
你佯装离开后找了个隐蔽位置运起敛息术，自身散发的神识波动随着功法的效果被最大限度的降低了。¤After you pretended to leave, you found a concealed location to transport the Breath-Containing Technique, and the fluctuations in the consciousness that you radiated were minimized with the effect of the technique.
{xiaozi}你现在声望过低，还是想其他办法吧。¤{xiaozi} Your reputation is too low now, so let's think of another way.
在你即将得手时，一股强大的神识从你的位置扫过，但和预想的一样，什么都没有发生。¤As you were about to succeed, a powerful sense of God swept from your position, but as expected, nothing happened.
还未等你习惯性地掏出灵石贿赂守卫，他已是向城内修士发出了传音符。虽然不知道传音符的具体内容，但一看从城中御剑而来的几位金丹修士，便知局势肯定是不利于你。¤Before you habitually take out the spirit stones to bribe the guards, he has already issued the sound transmission talisman to the cultivators in the city. Although I don’t know the specific content of the sound transmission talisman, I have a look at the golden core cultivators who came from the city’s imperial swords. , Knowing that the situation is definitely not good for you.
顾忌到城外战斗可能引来无尽的麻烦，你决定运起遁术，赶在麻烦到来之前离去。¤Considering that fighting outside the city may cause endless trouble, you decide to take the escape technique and leave before the trouble arrives.
{xiaozi}，你被发现了！快离开！¤{xiaozi}, you have been found! Leave now!
就在你即将进入时，一股强大的神识扫过你的位置，然后锁定住了你。¤Just as you were about to enter, a powerful sense of consciousness swept across your position, and then locked you in.
你在无尽之海的名声不佳，来来往往巡逻的守卫便是为了防止你这样的邪修。若直接上岛，必定会被拦下...¤Your reputation in the endless sea is not good, and the guards patrolling are here to prevent evil cultivators like you. If you go directly to the island, you will definitely be stopped...
在你自以为即将得手时，一股强大的神识从你的位置扫过，一时间城内警报大作，显然是触发了其中警戒。¤When you thought you were about to succeed, a powerful sense of God swept across from your position, and the city's alarm was suddenly mastered, which obviously triggered the alert.
就在你即将进入城中时，一股强大的神识扫过你的位置，然后锁定住了你。¤Just as you were about to enter the city, a powerful sense of God swept across your location, and then locked you in.
大长老那根万魂幡，据说来之前已经有八千魂，分下来我们只要收集五百魂就够了，现在已经收集了四百魂，再熬几年也就差不多了。¤The Grand Elder that ten thousand souls streamer, it is said to have eight thousand souls before coming, divided down we only need to collect five hundred souls is enough, now has collected four hundred souls, and then boil a few years will be almost enough.
你们光是布下这拘魂阵，就不知残害了多少冤魂罢。¤You have killed many souls just by setting up the Soul Detention Formation.
若是一直都像刚来时那么快自然可以，可这收集的速度越来越慢，这都几个月了，一个魂影都没有，再这样下去别说几年了，几十年也抓不够啊。¤If it is always as fast as when you first came naturally, but the collection speed is getting slower and slower, it has been several months, a soul shadow is not, and if this continues not to mention a few years, decades are not enough to catch ah.
阵法刚被破除，其中束缚着的数百个魂体便夺阵而出，万魂殿的长老们也发现了你。¤The formation was just broken, and the hundreds of souls bound therein seized the formation and came out, and the elders of the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls found you.
看来这里便是第二座拘魂阵所在了...¤It seems that this is where the second soul-holding formation is located...
敢问二位，这大长老现在何处？可否帮在下引荐一二？¤May I ask you two, where is this Grand Elder now? Can you introduce me to him?
前辈若想与大长老一叙，晚辈自当给前辈带路。前辈这边请。¤If senior wishes to have a chat with the Grand Elder, junior will show senior the way. Please come this way, senior.
洞窟内阴风阵阵，只一靠近便感觉到一阵晕眩，似乎有什么东西正牵引着你的神识。¤The cave inside the gusts of wind, only a close will feel a dizzy, as if something is pulling your consciousness.
哼，什么人？¤What kind of person is that?
这可是我们……¤This is us ......
不远处传来了修士交谈的声音，你迅速躲至掩体后，未有惊动到他们。¤Not far away came the sound of cultivators talking to each other, you quickly hide behind a cover, did not alarm them.
自然是劝她就此收手，莫要再残害生灵。¤Naturally, she was advised to stop and not to kill any more living creatures.
说着，你随手一击便将拘魂阵击碎，一众魂体从中四散逃开。¤With these words, you shatter the soul-holding formation with a single blow, from which a host of souls scatter and flee.
这……大长老不是在考虑迁阵吗？将这拘魂阵迁至阴冥海或者幽冥海，若是能敲定一个好去处，顺利的话一年之内便能搞定了。¤This ...... Grand Elder is not considering moving the formation? The Soul Detention Formation will be moved to the Underworld Sea or the Underworld Sea, if we can finalize a good place to go, it will be done within a year if it goes well.
他们二人完全没有注意到你的气息，你就像凭空出现在他们身前一般。¤The two of them didn't notice your scent at all; it was as if you appeared out of nowhere in front of them.
你打算先将这里的阵法破除，但还是低估了这些阵法的精妙程度，很快便被人发现了。¤You intended to break the formations here first, but still underestimated the subtlety of these formations and were soon discovered.
忽然间，那拘魂阵好似感应到了什么，亮起了黑光。几条细长的黑手从阵中飞出，直奔你背后的铁剑。¤Suddenly, the soul detention formation seems to sense something, lit up with black light. Several slender black hands flew out from the formation and headed straight for the iron sword behind you.
不远处传来了修士交谈的声音。你稍加敛息，即便走到距他们很近的位置，他们仍未发现你。¤Not far away comes the sound of cultivators talking to each other. You restrain your breath a little, and even when you walk very close to them, they still do not notice you.
这鸟不拉屎的地方，咱们到底还要呆多久？¤How long are we going to stay in this shitty place?
阵中掉落出几块神阴石，你便也一并收了起来。¤A few divine Yin stones fell out of the formation, so you took them along with you.
…这位前辈，敢问，找我殿大长老究竟是有何贵干？¤...this senior, may I ask, what exactly is the purpose of seeking the Grand Elder of my hall?
师兄，莫要冲动，对手可是化神修士，不是我们能应对的了的。¤Brother, don't be impulsive, the opponent is a Deity Transformation Cultivator , it's not something we can handle.
看来这里便是最后一座拘魂阵所在了...¤It seems that this is where the last Soul Detention Formation is located...
何人在此？¤Who is here?
此阵法颇为诡异，若是不能破除此阵法...¤This formation is very strange, if we can't break this formation...
你对于阵法一道颇有研究，想要偷偷破除这几个拘魂阵法对你来说并非难事。¤You are quite a researcher for the formation one, want to secretly break these few soul detaining formations is not a difficult task for you.
听着这两名修士抱怨，你心里在盘算着究竟应该如何处理。¤Listening to the two cultivators complain, you are calculating in your mind how exactly you should handle it.
唉，真是晦气...本来打算与那冥河水母一较高下，熟料卷进了突然形成的乱流中。幸好附近有船队经过，不然怕是没命回来了......¤Oh, it's really bad luck... I originally planned to compete with the Styx jellyfish, and the clinker was caught in the sudden turbulence. Fortunately, there was a fleet passing by nearby, otherwise I am afraid that I will come back..... .
罢了，此次不伤你{xiaozi}性命，日后切莫再犯。¤Forget it, this time it won't hurt your {xiaozi} life, so don't do it again in the future.
呼，这{SayStcVal=928}卧虎藏龙，我还是先离开吧。¤Huh, this {SayStcVal=928} Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I'll leave first.
把这家伙打晕再悄悄溜进去，速度得快一些以免他上告宗门......¤Knock this guy stunned and sneak in quietly, faster to prevent him from suing the sect...
哎...也不知道我什么时候才有在宗门自己开辟洞府的权利...¤Hey... I don't know when I have the right to open a cave in the sect by myself...
明白，明白。我事先都已经准备好了...¤Understood. Understood. I have prepared it beforehand...
对方脸色一冷。¤The other party's face went cold.
世间材料皆分天阳、地阴。同种五行属性不同种阴阳表现的效果也会不同，所以要是追求极致便要追求极阴、极阳。¤The world's materials are divided into Astral Yang and Umbral Yin. The effects of different yin and yang of the same five element attributes will be different, so if you pursue the ultimate, you must pursue the extreme yin and the extreme yang.
而且，炼器之道也颇为危险，领悟的不够精深就难以驾驭炼制高阶法宝。¤Furthermore, the way of refining tools is quite dangerous. If you don't understand it deeply, it will be difficult to control the refining of high-level magic weapons.
我没有500灵石...¤I don't have 500 spirit stones...
替我将阵旗取来。¤Get the flag for me.
世间材料皆有五种属性：灵力亲和、灵力操控、灵性、坚固、坚韧；在炼制法宝时，若有一项为零则不能成器，同样五维各项越高越好，越能把灵力发挥到极致。¤The materials in the world all have five attributes: spiritual affinity, spiritual control, spirituality, firmness, and tenacity; when refining magic weapons, if one of them is zero, they cannot be made into weapons. Similarly, the higher the five-dimensional items, the better. The more you can maximize your spiritual power.
同一组材料在炼制不同武器的时候也呈现不同特性，{shidi}你自己还要多多实验。¤The same set of materials also exhibit different characteristics when refining different weapons, {shidi} you have to experiment more.
{FirstName}长老还有什么别的吩咐么？¤What else does Elder {FirstName} have to order?
哈哈哈，那就由我来给{shidi}聊聊炼器之道。¤Hahaha, let me talk to {shidi} about the way of refining tools.
{shidi}初入门派，不知可了解过炼器之道？¤{shidi} Beginners, I don’t know if you know the way of refining tools?
说着，他便从储物袋中取出五面被白雾笼罩着的旗帜递给了你。¤Speaking, he took out five flags Shielded in white mist from his storage bag and handed it to you.
什么嘛，浪费我这么多时间¤What is it, wasting so much time for me
炼器是一门将不同五维特性、不同阴阳属性、不同五行属性的材料融合在一起成器的法门。¤The refining device is a method of combining materials with different five-dimensional characteristics, different yin and yang attributes, and different five element attributes into a device.
{shidi}何事？¤{shidi}What's the matter?
哈哈哈，{shidi}我看好你啊。¤Hahaha, {shidi} I am optimistic about you.
对方脸色一暖。¤The other party's face warmed.
世间材料皆分五行，材料之中若是五行相克就需要五行相合的炼器手法才能成器。¤The world's materials are divided into five elements. If the five elements are mutually restrained in the material, the refining technique of the five elements is required to become a tool.
我这里有一本《炼器入门》，领悟之后炼器之道便可初窥门径，{shidi}你就可以着手炼器了。都是同门500灵石就给你了。¤I have a book of Introduction to Refining. After you understand the way of refining, you can get a glimpse of the path, {shidi} you can start refining. All 500 spirit stones of the same school will be given to you.
恭喜{FirstName}长老结成金丹，门派里都已经传遍了，以后可要请长老多多关照了。¤Congratulations to the elder {FirstName} for forming the Golden Core. It has been spread throughout the school, and I will ask the elders for your care in the future.
神兵阁重地，{shidi}还是不要多做逗留。¤Shenbing Pavilion, {shidi} still don't stay longer.
{shixiong}，有何吩咐？¤{shixiong}, what's your order?
炼器首先要有炼器室，本门的炼器室你来找我开启就好。¤The refining equipment must have a refining room first. You can open the refining room of this door by asking me to open it.
嗯？刚才那路过的修士好像有点眼熟？¤Ok? The cultivator who passed by just now seemed a little familiar?
别管他了，我们还是快些回林府给你疗伤吧。¤Leave him alone, let's hurry back to the Lin Mansion to heal you.
算了，当务之急还是回林府给{$Lin}治疗。¤Forget it, the top priority is to return to the Lin Mansion to treat {$Lin}.
（在林府休息好几天了，去看看{$Lin}在做什么吧。没猜错的话，她应该在{color=#d0380a}林府长老堂{/color}。）¤(Have rested in Lin Mansion for a few days, let's go and see what {$Lin} is doing. If you guessed correctly, she should be in {color=#d0380a}Lin Mansion Elder Hall{/color}.)
嗯？刚才那修士好像有点眼熟？¤Ok? That cultivator seemed a little familiar just now?
你们也未在此处多做停留，驾驭着法宝回到天星城林府养伤。¤You also did not stay here much longer and rode the magic treasure back to the Lin House in Tianxing City to recuperate.
你们离开洞窟时，恰巧一个修士驾驭着法宝如流光般往化尘教方向飞去，没等你们细看已是消失在视野范围内。¤You left the cave, it so happened that a cultivator harnessed a magic treasure like a stream of light to the direction of the Dust Transformation Church, did not wait for you to look closely has disappeared within the field of vision.
（那种熟悉感...好像修炼的是神识相关的功法...究竟是谁呢...）¤(That kind of familiarity... It seems that the cultivation method is related to spiritual consciousness... Who is it...)
好在那冥蛛追击了你们到洞口后，应该是担心被调虎离山，转身守护那万载冰心石去了，让你们得以安全逃离。¤The good thing is that the spider chased you to the mouth of the cave, should be worried about being transferred away from the mountain, turned around to guard the 10,000 years of ice heart stone to go, so you can safely escape.
你觉得此人声音有些熟悉，但又不清楚何时听过，只是期待着此前击败你的“伪元婴修士”会及时停下手来。¤You feel that this person's voice is somewhat familiar, but you don't know when you have heard it. You just expect that the pseudo Nascent Soul cultivator who defeated you before will stop in time.
无妨，先听他说。¤It's okay, just listen to him first.
冲虚散人闻言也是一滞，但凝集好的神通显然无法轻易散去。¤Chongxu Sanren was also stagnant when he heard the words, but the condensed magical powers obviously could not be easily dispersed.
老朽的徒儿不会...¤An old apprentice won't...
说的好听，无惑前辈可知你这宝贝弟子此前为了强娶林家二小姐而贿赂栖云真人一事？¤It sounds nice, does Senior Wuhu know that your precious disciple bribed Master Qiyun in order to forcefully marry the second miss of the Lin family?
毁坏大殿实在是抱歉，但晚辈也确是事出有因才拜访星宫。¤I am really sorry for destroying the main hall, but the juniors did visit the Star Palace for a reason.
是你！之前在林府大典上害我星宫丢尽颜面，今日竟然还敢找上门来！¤It's you! Before, at the Lin Mansion Grand Ceremony, I caused my Xinggong to lose face, but today I dare to come to you!
你详细地转述冲虚散人在林家的作为，又告知了此前的猜测。¤You detailed the actions of the Chongxu Sanren in the Lin family, and informed the previous speculation.
就这点实力也敢来我星宫闹事？¤Dare to come to my star palace to make trouble with this little strength?
宫主！老朽徒儿向来坚守道心，定然不会以邪术突破，肯定是他满口胡言！¤Palace Lord! The old disciple has always adhered to the Tao, and he will definitely not break through with sorcery. He must be full of nonsense!
星铃儿正想张嘴驳斥无惑真人，但话到了嘴边又咽了回去，吐了吐舌头便躲到宫主身后。这二人身形相似，倒也遮了个严严实实。无惑真人也只得再次将矛头转向你。¤Xing Ling'er was about to open her mouth to refute the real person Wuhuo, but she swallowed the words when they reached her mouth, stuck her tongue out and hid behind the palace lord. The two are similar in shape, but they are also covered tightly. Real Wuhuo had no choice but to turn on you again.
正当你嘲笑冲虚散人时，一位看不出深浅的女修带着另一名大概金丹初期的女修来到大殿，却只是走到一旁，既不开口，也没有动手的意思。¤Just when you were laughing at Chongxu Sanren, a female cultivator who could not see the depth brought another female cultivator who was probably in the early stage of Jindan to the main hall, but just walked to the side, neither speaking nor intending to do anything.
无惑真人一时气结，又因事实摆在面前，说不出话来。¤The real Wuhuo was angry for a while, and because of the facts, he was speechless.
有宫主这句话，我就放心了。¤With the words of the palace master, I am relieved.
哼，只怕是他不敢承认罢。¤Hmph, I'm afraid he doesn't dare admit it.
咳...你这个伪元婴修士，真是丢星宫的脸，哈哈哈！¤Cough...you fake Yuan Ying cultivator, you really lose the face of the Star Palace, hahaha!
哼，油嘴滑舌。虽不知你是怎么快达到元婴境界，但多半是你自恃实力出言不逊，才引老朽徒儿怒而出手。¤Humph, slick tongue. Although I don't know how you reached the Nascent Soul realm so quickly, it's most likely that you are arrogant about your own strength, and that's why you provoke the wrath of the old man.
小友境界虽有不足，实力却很不错，但在我星宫出手，甚至毁我待客殿，想必不是为了挑事这么简单吧？¤Although the realm of the little friend is insufficient, the strength is very good, but in my star palace, and even destroying my hospitality hall, it must not be as simple as picking things up?
也巧这栖云真人贪财，上了冲虚的钩，事情败露后落得个思过一甲子的下场。只是没想到丹阳子前辈放了你徒儿一马，他却还不思悔过，以邪术突破后又来为难林家。¤Coincidentally, the real person Qiyun was greedy for money, and he was hooked on the bait. I just didn't expect that Senior Danyangzi let your disciple go, but he still didn't want to regret it. After breaking through with sorcery, he came to embarrass the Lin family.
哦？只要你的解释合理，本宫便不追究此事。¤Oh? As long as your explanation is reasonable, this palace will not pursue this matter.
你这星宫大长老真是几百年修为都在脸上了！¤You, the Great Elder of the Star Palace, have been cultivated for hundreds of years on your face!
联姻一事本就很正常，冲虚有何必要贿赂那栖云真人。¤The matter of marriage is very normal, why is there any need for Chongxu to bribe that Qiyun Master?
冲虚，停下。¤Chongxu, stop.
宫主，我这劣徒哪敢违逆，只是这神通好放不好收啊。¤Palace Master, how dare I disobey me as a scoundrel, it’s just that this supernatural power is easy to put away and hard to collect.
也不知当年是谁在丹阳子前辈面前灰溜溜地带着弟子离去，还...¤I don't know who was in front of Senior Danyangzi and led the disciples away back then, and...
正当你把希望全寄托在林家的秘宝时，一道清冷的女声传入你和冲虚散人的耳中。¤Just when you pinned all your hopes on the secret treasure of the Lin family, a cold female voice entered the ears of you and Chongxu Sanren.
冲虚散人披头散发的跌坐在你对面，衣袍也是破烂不堪。哪里还有星宫长老的样子，若要是你刚才下手再重点，彻底击毁了这星宫的待客大殿，俨然就是一副衣着破烂的乞丐在废墟中呆滞的画面。¤Chongxu Sanren stumbled across from you with disheveled hair, and his robes were in tatters. Where is the appearance of the elders of the Star Palace? If you had just started and focused on it, you completely destroyed the hospitality hall of the Star Palace, just like a picture of a beggar in tattered clothes sluggish in the ruins.
小友既身怀林家秘宝，想必是深受林家信任，便与本宫一同去林家吧。¤Since the little friend is carrying the Lin family's secret treasure, he must be deeply trusted by the Lin family, so let's go to the Lin family with Ben Gong.
几息之后，又有一位男修急冲冲的御空飞来。一入破烂的大殿便是赶到冲虚散人身旁，确认他只是受了轻伤，而性命无碍，才放下心来。¤After a few breaths, another male cultivator rushed over from the sky. As soon as he entered the dilapidated hall, he rushed to the side of Chongxu Sanren, confirming that he was only slightly injured and his life was safe, so he was relieved.
你什么意思！¤What do you mean!
眼看星宫宫主询问，冲虚却只是瘫坐在地，不做言语，也不知是在刚才的战斗中神识有损，还是没有从战败的低迷情绪中缓过来。¤Seeing the Star Palace Palace Master asking, Chong Xu just slumped on the ground and didn't say a word. He didn't know if his consciousness was damaged in the battle just now, or he didn't recover from the depressed mood of defeat.
毋需多言，先把冲虚押入禁制，待本宫去一趟林家了解情况后再做处理，若冲虚真是用邪法亦或是采补之术，后果就不用我多说了。¤Needless to say, first put Chongxu into the ban, and then I will deal with it after Ben Gong goes to Lin's house to understand the situation. If Chongxu really uses an evil method or a supplementary technique, I don't need to say more about the consequences.
只是他在突破时用了什么邪术就不得而知了。¤It's just that he didn't know what kind of magic he used when breaking through.
好了，无惑师徒确实做的不对，小友你也不用再奚落他二人。还是让冲虚自己来说说突破的事吧。¤Well, Wuhuo's master and apprentice are indeed doing something wrong, little friend, you don't need to ridicule the two of them anymore. Let Chong Xu talk about the breakthrough.
冲虚的情况的确不合常理，符合小友的怀疑。此事本宫会亲自调查，待事了之后给林家一个说法。¤The situation of Chongxu is indeed unreasonable, which is in line with Xiaoyou's suspicion. This matter will be personally investigated by the Palace, and an explanation will be given to the Lin family after the matter is settled.
哼，那事暂且不提。你今日上门打伤我星宫长老又毁坏待客殿可是有假？¤Hmm, not to mention that. You came to my door today to hurt my Star Palace Elder and destroy the Hospitality Hall, but is it fake?
一派胡言！冲虚作为老朽弟子，虽不是资质上佳，但数百年来也是恪守宫规，从未与人强结道侣以双修。又怎会为了突破使用邪术？¤Nonsense! As an old disciple, Chongxu, although not highly qualified, has been abiding by the palace rules for hundreds of years, and has never formed a Taoist companion for double cultivation. How could he use sorcery in order to break through?
当年在林家我不是你对手，但今日，可不同以往。¤I was not your opponent in the Lin family back then, but today is different.
废物就是废物，之前在林府你不是我对手，几十年过去还是不值一哂。亏得你还为突破瓶颈不择手段，结果实力还是如此不堪。¤Trash is trash. You were no match for me in the Lin Mansion before, and after a few decades, it is still worthless. Thanks to you, you are still doing everything you can to break through the bottleneck, and your strength is still so unbearable.
你这徒儿平日里的为人的确没有问题，但吾辈修士谁不是向着长生而去，又有谁甘心苦修数百年后落得个寿终而亡的结局？¤There is indeed no problem with your normal person, but who of our cultivators is not going for immortality, and who is willing to die after hundreds of years of hard work?
只是冲虚前辈名为元婴修士却实力不济，竟在占据先机的情况下任不是我对手。¤It's just that Senior Chongxu, who is called the Yuanying cultivator, is not strong enough, and he is not my opponent when he takes the lead.
以你现在的状态若是再硬接一次神念诀，只怕当场就要神魂消散，陨落于此。¤With your current state, if you insist on receiving the Divine Mind Art again, I am afraid that the Divine Soul will dissipate on the spot and fall here.
怎么？刚提起过冲虚多年前在林家的所为，你这当师傅的又忘了？¤how? I just mentioned what Chongxu did in the Lin family many years ago, but you, the master, forgot?
你只好将残存不多的灵力注入林家秘宝中，希冀着能有一条生路。¤You have no choice but to inject the little remaining spiritual power into the Lin family's secret treasure, hoping for a way out.
事情就是这样。而且经过刚才这一战，我也确信冲虚散人虽是突破到元婴期，但实力比金丹后期修士强不上太多，不然战斗也不会如此胶着。¤That's the way it is. And after the battle just now, I am also convinced that although the Chongxu Sanren has broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, his strength is not much stronger than that of the late Jindan cultivator, otherwise the battle will not be so stalemate.
晚辈{FirstName}{LastName}见过两位前辈。¤The junior {FirstName}{LastName} has seen two seniors.
倒是这人来我星宫惹事还打伤星宫长老，我徒儿出手也是情理之...咦？这不是丹阳子的法宝么，此物应该被那老贼赠与他小女儿了才对，为何在你这{xiaozi}手里？¤But this man came to my Star Palace to cause trouble and injured a Star Palace elder, so it is reasonable for my disciple to take action... What? This should have been given to his young daughter by that old thief, why is it in your {xiaozi} hand?
怎么，连本宫的话都敢无视？¤Why, dare to ignore the words of this palace?
那神念诀的金芒即将命中你时，果然像是撞在一堵气墙上一般，碎裂后化作点点金光，煞是好看。¤When the golden light of the divine mind was about to hit you, it really seemed to hit a wall of air.
这就更是冤枉了。我只不过是路过林家时，听说冲虚散人近期突破到元婴，还以为他是在上次事件后痛改前非，特意来星宫祝贺。¤This is even more wrong. When I just passed by the Lin family, I heard that Chongxu Sanren recently broke through to Nascent Soul. I thought he had changed his mind after the last incident and came to the Star Palace to congratulate him.
冲虚散人披头散发的跌坐在你对面，衣袍也是破烂不堪。哪里还有星宫长老的样子，若要是你刚才下手再重点彻底击毁这星宫的待客大殿，俨然就是一副衣着破烂的乞丐在废墟中呆滞的画面。¤Chongxu Sanren stumbled across from you with disheveled hair, and his robes were in tatters. Where is the appearance of the elders of the Star Palace, if you just started and then focused on completely destroying the hospitality hall of the Star Palace, it would be like a picture of a beggar in tattered clothes sluggish in the ruins.
但联想到此人已是元婴长老，这场面不免有些怪异。只是你在星宫宫主和无惑长老的注视下没心思嘲弄他就是了。¤But thinking that this person is already the Yuan Ying elder, this scene is a bit strange. It's just that you don't have the heart to mock him under the gaze of the Star Palace Palace Master and Elder Wuhuo.
待金光散去，却见一位女修站在你身前不远处，若是换个角度就能看到她正对冲虚散人怒目而视。看来挡下神念诀的并不是林家的秘宝，而是这位女性修士。¤When the golden light dissipated, you saw a female cultivator standing not far in front of you. If you change the angle, you can see that she is glaring at the vain person. It seemed that it wasn't the Lin family's secret treasure that blocked the Spiritual Mind, but the female cultivator.
而且应该就是刚才要求冲虚散人停手的那位。¤And it should be the one who just asked the Chongxu Sanren to stop.
冲虚散人面如死灰，无惑真人也是面露讶色，强大女修却是嘴角略微上扬，一副很感兴趣的样子，而星铃儿只是好笑的看着你，也不知她在想什么。¤Chongxu Sanren's face is ashen, Wuhuozhen is also surprised, but the powerful female cultivator's mouth is slightly raised, and she looks very interested, and Xing Linger just looks at you funny, I don't know what she is thinking .
眼看星宫宫主询问，冲虚散人满脸愤懑，但事到如今也不敢临时编制出个谎言来，只得沉默不语。¤Seeing Xinggong Palace Master asking, Chongxu Sanren was full of resentment, but he didn't dare to temporarily make up a lie, so he had to remain silent.
若换做是无惑你寿元将尽，且无法突破瓶颈，又会作何选择呢？¤If it is Wuhuo, your lifespan will be exhausted, and you cannot break through the bottleneck, what choice will you make?
冲虚散人面如死灰，无惑真人也是面露讶色，强大女修却是嘴角略微上扬，一副很感兴趣的样子，而个金丹期女修，一副不是很感兴趣的样子，不知在思考什么。¤Chongxu Sanren's face was ashen, and Wuhuozhen was also surprised, but the powerful female cultivator's mouth was slightly raised, and she looked very interested, while the Jindan stage female cultivator looked not very interested. I don't know what to think.
宫主，这...¤Lord, this...
那被称为宫主的女修没再开口说什么，而是转过身来看着你，像是等着你解释。¤The female nun, who was called the palace master, didn't say anything, but turned around and looked at you, as if waiting for your explanation.
实不相瞒，晚辈正是受林家之托来此。¤To be honest, the younger generation was entrusted by the Lin family to come here.
正当你嘲笑冲虚散人时，一位看不出深浅的女修带着星铃儿来到大殿，却只是在旁看着，也不言语，倒是星铃儿一副很感兴趣的样子。¤Just when you were laughing at Chongxu Sanren, a female cultivator who could not see the depth brought Xing Linger to the main hall, but she just watched and did not speak, but Xing Linger looked very interested.
事情就是这样。而且经过刚才这一战，我也确信冲虚散人虽是突破到元婴期，但实力甚至不如一般的金丹后期修士，乃形神俱伤之相，符合我的猜测。¤That's the way it is. And after the battle just now, I am also convinced that although the Chongxu Sanren has broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, his strength is not even as good as that of the general Jindan late stage cultivator.
当年害星宫丢尽颜面的是谁，你心里没数么？居然还厚颜无耻的怪罪到我头上？¤Who was the one who harmed the Xinggong to lose face in those days, do you have no idea? You're still brazenly blaming me?
不过他冲虚散人好不容易到了元婴前期，却败在你一个晚辈手里，换做是其他人怕也是难以接受。更不用说你还曾为林家出头，坏了他的奸计，对你早已是怀恨在心。两者相合之下，对他的打击之大更是不言而喻。¤However, he finally reached the early stage of Nascent Soul, but he was defeated in the hands of one of your juniors. It would be difficult for other people to accept it. Not to mention that you once stood up for the Lin family, ruined his tricks, and already held a grudge against you. Under the combination of the two, the blow to him is even more self-evident.
哼，只怕是用了采补之术，再以潜力为代价强行突破了瓶颈。¤Hmph, I'm afraid I used the technique of harvesting and replenishing, and then forcibly broke through the bottleneck at the cost of potential.
冲虚散人原本苍白的面庞尽在暴怒之下涨得通红，严重更是金芒吞吐，下一发神念诀俨然已是在蕴量之中，随时都有可能出手。¤The originally pale face of the Chongxu Sanren turned red with rage, and even more serious was the golden light.
不过他冲虚散人好不容易到元婴前期，却败在你一个晚辈手里，换做是其他人怕也是难以接受。更不用说你还曾为林家出头，坏了他的奸计，对你早已是怀恨在心。两者相合之下，对他的打击之大更是不言而喻。¤However, he finally reached the early stage of Nascent Soul, but he was defeated in the hands of one of your juniors. It would be difficult for other people to accept it. Not to mention that you once stood up for the Lin family, ruined his tricks, and already held a grudge against you. Under the combination of the two, the blow to him is even more self-evident.
道友是何人？何故来我星宫伤人？¤Who is Daoyou? Why come to my star palace to hurt people?
以我的修为境界，没在数合内被元婴修士击杀都已是万幸，怎敢自恃实力出言不逊？¤With my cultivation realm, I was lucky not to be killed by the Nascent Soul cultivator within a few seconds. How could I dare to speak out against my own strength?
只得从怀中掏出用于掩盖自身气息的林家秘宝，寄希望于此物除掩盖气息外还有其他功效。¤He had to take out the Lin Family Secret Treasure that was used to cover up his aura from his arms, hoping that this thing would have other effects besides covering up his aura.
咳咳...看来是我高估自己了，但我可没低估你冲虚散人。就你这点实力，可不是元婴修士的水准。¤Cough cough... It seems that I overestimated myself, but I did not underestimate you. Your strength is not the level of a Yuanying cultivator.
没成想这冲虚一见是我，就驱动神通攻将上来，打我一个措手不及。¤Unexpectedly, as soon as this Chongxu saw me, he drove the supernatural powers to attack and caught me by surprise.
呵，还不是冲虚散人寿元无多，丹阳子前辈膝下两女又都是资质上乘，他便是打起了靠双修秘术突破的主意。¤Oh, it's not that there is not much life expectancy in Chongxu Sanren, and the two women below Danyangzi's knees are all highly qualified, so he has the idea of ​​relying on the double cultivation secret technique to break through.
几回合过后你终于是抵挡不住冲虚散人的神念诀。正面受一击后，只觉神魂震荡不停，随之而来的剧痛充满了你的意识，身体更是一软而后跌坐在地。¤After a few rounds, you are finally unable to resist the Spiritual Mind Art of Crushing the Void. After being hit from the front, you will feel that your soul is shaking constantly, and the severe pain that follows fills your consciousness, and your body softens and falls to the ground.
宫主！我徒儿只是一时糊涂才贿赂林家长老，但绝然不会以邪术突破！肯定是他满口胡言。¤Palace Lord! My apprentice was only temporarily confused to bribe the elders of the Lin family, but I will never break through with sorcery! He must be full of nonsense.
你将藏于衣袍内的林家秘宝收入储物袋中，展现出自己的真实实力。¤You will put the Lin family secret treasure hidden in the robe into the storage bag to show your true strength.
我日前路过林家，听说星宫冲虚长老晋升元婴期，特意来星宫祝贺。只是没想到这冲虚长老竟是一言不合就与我动起手来，怎能说是我来星宫伤人呢？¤I passed by the Lin family a few days ago, and I heard that Elder Xinggong Chongxu was promoted to the Nascent Soul Stage, so I came to Xinggong to congratulate him. I just didn't expect this Elder Chongxu to start with me without a word, how can it be said that I came to the Star Palace to hurt people?
他骂你厚颜无耻呢。¤He called you shameless.
大胆，哪有你多嘴的份！¤Bold, how can you talk too much!
手下败将还敢在这大放厥词，我这就让你永远闭嘴。¤If the defeated generals still dare to say nonsense here, I will make you shut up forever.
你适时将藏于衣袍内的林家秘宝收入储物袋中，展现出自己的真实实力。¤You put the Lin family secret treasure hidden in the robe into the storage bag at the right time to show your true strength.
哈哈哈，前辈想多了。¤Hahaha, senior thinks too much.
星铃儿正想张嘴驳斥无惑真人，但话到了嘴边又咽了回去，吐了吐舌头便躲到宫主身后。这二人身形相似，倒也遮了个严严实实。¤Xing Ling'er was about to open her mouth to refute the real person Wuhuo, but she swallowed the words when they reached her mouth, stuck her tongue out and hid behind the palace lord. The two are similar in shape, but they are also covered tightly.
大胆，哪轮得到你妄加揣测！¤Be bold, which round will get you to speculate!
星铃儿正想张嘴驳斥无惑真人，但话到了嘴边又咽了回去，吐了吐舌头便躲到宫主身后。正巧这二人身形相似，倒也遮了个严严实实。无惑真人只得再次将矛头转向你。¤Xing Ling'er was about to open her mouth to refute the real person Wuhuo, but she swallowed the words when they reached her mouth, stuck her tongue out and hid behind the palace lord. It just so happened that the two of them were similar in shape, but they were also covered up. Wuhuo Zhenren had to turn his attention to you again.
当年你徒儿要当众格杀我这晚辈时，没见你加以阻拦。今日我击败他，你却又在此饶舌。¤When your disciple wanted to kill my junior in public, I didn't see you stop it. Today I beat him, and you are babbling here.
只见冲虚散人神情狰狞，耀眼的神念金芒已是裹挟着死亡的气息向你急速迫近。¤I saw Chongxu Sanren's expression grim, and the dazzling golden light of soul sense was already approaching you with the breath of death.
前辈想多了。¤Seniors think too much.
冲虚道友嘴上功夫不错，但手底下的战斗力还是不太行啊。不过废物嘛，就是这样了。¤Daoist Chongxu's mouth is good, but the combat power of his hands is still not good. But trash, that's all.
哼，油嘴滑舌，道友怕不是自恃实力而出言不逊，才引老朽徒儿怒而出手。¤Hmph, slick tongue, Taoist friend is afraid that it is not because of his own strength that he makes a rude remark, and only causes the old disciple to anger and shoot.
想起当年林沐心也可能是凭借此物才对栖云真人造成大量麻烦，乃至令其受伤不浅，你又坚定了几分。¤Remembering that Lin Muxin might have caused a lot of trouble to Master Qiyun by virtue of this thing, and even caused him to be seriously injured, you are a little more determined.
于此同时一位年轻女修低着头缓步走到宫主身后站定，也是一言不发。而那冲虚则是安静地站在自己师父无惑真人的身后，一副淡然的样子，似乎刚才违抗宫主命令的不是他。¤At the same time a young female cultivator walked slowly with her head down to stand behind the palace master, also without saying a word. And that Chongxu is quietly standing behind his own master, Confusionless Real, a bashful look, as if it was not him who just disobeyed the palace master's order.
（不好，他没有停手的意思，只怕是想先动手再说。）{vpunch=10,0.5}¤(No, he didn't mean to stop, I'm just afraid he wanted to do it first.) {vpunch=10,0.5}
好了，无惑师徒确实做的不对，小友你也不用再奚落他二人了。还是让冲虚自己来说说突破的事吧。有此事？¤Well, Wuhuo's master and apprentice are indeed doing something wrong, little friend, you don't need to ridicule the two of them anymore. Let Chong Xu talk about the breakthrough. Is there any such thing?
解决了...回风雨楼领赏吧...¤Solved... Go back to the Rain or Shine Building to collect your reward...
风雨楼令牌微微颤抖。¤The Wind and Rain House token trembles slightly.
你不是此人对手，但索性遁速略胜一筹，这才得以狼狈的逃离了此地。¤You were no match for this man, but you were able to escape from this place in a mess because your speed of evasion was slightly better.
道友可曾听说过阴冥泉？¤Friends of Taoism have ever heard of Yin Mingquan?
我还未曾听闻将七彩月兰与腐骨灵花一同入药的，你收集这两种草药做什么？¤I have never heard of the use of the Rainbow Moon Orchid and the Earth Matriarch Petal as medicine. What how can use these two herbs?
草药我已经都给你带来了，按照约定，你必须把秘方一起告诉我。¤I have brought you all the herbs. As agreed, you must tell me the secret recipe together.
老夫会在南崖城的客栈等你，但如果在此之前我就收集到了足够的草药，那这些灵石可就是别人的了。¤The old man will wait for you at the inn in Nanya City, but if I have collected enough herbs before then, these spirit stones are someone else's.
我的确能帮你弄到这两种草药，但我想交换的并不是你的灵石。¤I can indeed get these two herbs for you, but what I want to exchange is not your spirit stone.
听这名字，似乎和阴冥海有关？¤Listening to this name, it seems to be related to Deep Yin Sea?
或者你也可以去坊市或者拍卖行碰碰运气，我不管你用什么方式，把东西带来就行。¤Or you can go to the market or auction house to try your luck. I don't care what method you use, just bring things.
这秘方原本老夫不打算外传，但若是你能一次性拿出3株腐骨灵花与3株七彩月兰给我的话，这秘方和18万的灵石就都归你了。¤This old man did not have any intention to sell the recipe, but if you can give me 3 Earth Matriarch Petals and 3 Rainbow Moon Orchids at once, this secret recipe and 180,000 spirit stones will belong to you.
不错，不错...这些总算是够了。¤Yes, yes... these are enough at last.
我这里恰好就有这两种草药，按你说好的价，一株四万灵石，它们就是你的了。¤I happen to have these two herbs here. At the price you agreed, a 40,000 spiritual stone, they are yours.
我要的东西你带来了么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Did you bring what I wanted? {w}{w=0.5}
阴冥，玄冥与幽冥三海，皆位于南方极阴之地，但论阴气最重则当以阴冥海为首，而这极阴之水也只能在阴冥海的部分岛屿上找到。¤The three seas of Deep Yin, Deep Black, and Deep Hell are all located in the extremely yin land of the south, but the heaviest Yin Qi should be headed by the Deep Yin Sea, and this extremely yin water can only be found on some islands in the Deep Yin Sea. turn up.
道友还有何事？¤What else is there for fellow Daoists?
这腐骨灵花有养魂之药性，而七彩月兰则有清心之药性，二者皆为性寒之药，本就生长于极寒极阴之地，经过这阴冥泉水的泡发一日后，能够最大程度发挥其药效。¤The Earth Matriarch Petal has the Soulbuilding properties, while the Rainbow Moon Orchid has the Calming properties. Both are cold aspected, being natural grown in extreme cold temperatures. After soaking in the Nether pool for a day, their potency has been maximized.
不错，这阴冥泉实质上是极阴之气凝聚到极致后液化的表现。¤Yes, this Yin Mingquan is essentially a manifestation of the extremely Yin Qi condensed to the extreme and liquefied.
好吧，我的确急需不少数量的草药...¤Well, I do need a lot of herbs urgently...
如果你这里还有多余的草药，老夫我还是用这个价收。¤If you have extra herbs here, I will still charge you at this price, old man.
老夫正在收集五品仙草七彩月兰与腐骨灵花，道友这里若是有的话，老夫愿用每株40000灵石的高价收购。{w}{w=0.5}¤The old man is collecting the fifth-grade herbs, Rainbow Moon Orchids and Earth Matriarch Petals. If you have them friend, this old man is willing to buy them at a high price of 40,000 spirit stones. {w}{w=0.5}
（若真有如此奇效，那也确实值得冒险去那阴冥海一探了。）¤(If there is such a miraculous effect, it is indeed worth the adventure to explore the Deep Yin Sea.)
这腐骨灵花乃五品仙草，生长在极阴之地。我听说，只有在幽冥海的一些岛屿上才能找到这种草药。¤This Earth Matriarch Petal is a fifth-grade celestial herb that grows in a pure yin energy. I heard that this herb can only be found on some islands in the Deep Hell Sea.
若是你能将你收集这两种草药的目的告诉我，我可以用更便宜的价格把它们出让给你。¤If you can tell me the purpose of collecting these two herbs, I can sell them to you at a cheaper price.
（提防地看着你）道友何故要问这么多，若是没有的话就别在这里妨碍老夫了。¤(Watching you watchfully) Why do fellow Daoists have to ask so much? If you don't have one, don't hinder the old man here.
这七彩月兰极为神秘，只有在月圆之时才会开花，平日里若不仔细观察则与寻常杂草无异。我听说，只有在吞云海的一些岛屿上才能找到这种草药。¤The Rainbow Moon Orchid is extremely mysterious. It only blooms when the moon is full. It is no different from ordinary weeds if you don't observe it carefully. I heard that this herb can only be found on some islands in the Sea of ​​Swallowing Clouds.
如果你这里还有七彩月兰与腐骨灵花，老夫我还是用这个价收。¤If you still have Rainbow Moon Orchids and Earth Matriarch Petals, this old man will still purchase them at the same price.
哈哈哈哈哈，老夫言而有信，这里是八万灵石，拿去吧。¤Hahahahaha, the old man believes in his words, this is the eighty thousand spiritual stones, let's take it.
只需用这吸收了药性后的灵水擦拭双目，便有提神清目的奇效。如此往复三到四次，甚至能够让双目练就一些想象不到的奇妙瞳术。¤Just wipe the eyes with the spiritual water after absorbing the medicinal properties, and there will be a refreshing and refreshing effect. Three to four times in this way, you can even practice some unimaginable magical pupil skills in the eyes.
眼前之人在你的感知之下，似是一座即将喷发的火山，内里炙热翻涌表面气息却是静若止水。¤The person in front of you is, to your perception, a volcano about to erupt, with a sizzling interior but a still surface.
我虽是久居麟庙之内，但对你也是早有耳闻。不论是外门大比夺得魁首，还是天魔眼为门争光，称得上我离火门的栋梁之材。¤Although I have lived within the Lin Temple for a long time, I have heard a lot about you. Whether it is winning the top prize in the Outer Sect Competition or the Heavenly Demon Eye, you are a pillar of my Heavenly Fire Gate.
最近虽是风平浪静，但我总觉得心神不宁，{shidi}你还是路上多多留心。¤It's been quiet lately, but I've always felt distracted. {shidi} You should keep an eye on the road.
此剑本是我闲暇时的练手之作，就先借给{shidi}防身吧。¤This sword was intended for practice in my spare time, so I will lend it to {shidi} for defence for now.
{FirstName}{shidi}，你最近是见不到家师了。自我接手绝焰堂之后，唉，师尊倒是也放心把这里里外外的事情都交给我。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, you will not been able to see my master recently. Since I took over the Absolute Flame Hall, alas, the master is relieved to leave this inside and out to me.
你察觉到对方似是苦笑一下。¤You detect what appears to be a bitter smile on the other side.
你搞错了，炎麟大圣乃是家师，目前在外云游。在下绝焰堂大长老钟焰。¤You are mistaken, the Great Sage Yan Lin is my family's master and is currently travelling in the clouds. I am Grand Elder Zhong Yan of the Absolute Flame Hall.
嗯？还有嘱咐？¤Hmm? More instructions?
也许是我多心了，{shidi}不要嫌我烦就好。¤Maybe I'm just being paranoid, {shidi} just don't get annoyed with me.
以你的炼器造诣，也是察觉了一丝不对。¤With your attainment in smithing, you too have sensed a hint of something wrong.
{FirstName}{shidi}，客气了。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, you're welcome.
化尘教来信，此次交易由恒如真人负责，你到了化尘教他应会接待你。¤A letter from the Cult of the Dust of Transformation, this transaction will be handled by the real Heng Ru, and he should receive you when you arrive at the Cult of the Dust of Transformation.
眼前之人你在他身上感受不到任何灵气波动好似一个凡人。¤The person in front of you does not feel any aura fluctuation on him as if he is a mortal.
只见他一掐法诀，一柄赤红的飞剑从一旁的墙上向你飞来。剑身上炙热的波动，让你明白这至少是柄上品法宝。¤As soon as you see him do a magic trick, a red-red flying sword flies towards you from a side wall. The searing heat of the sword makes you understand that it is at least a top grade magic treasure.
是这样的，最近化尘教向我门求购一批火麟玉，我想劳烦{shidi}运送此物。¤This is how it is. Recently, the Dust Transformation Sect has asked our sect for a batch of Fire Forest Jade, and I would like to trouble {shidi} to deliver this item.
我虽是久居麟庙之内，但对你也是早有耳闻，外门大比夺得魁首之时我就很看好你。¤Although I have lived in the Lin Temple for a long time, I have heard a lot about you.
我就知道{shidi}你不会推辞，这个储物袋就是火麟玉。¤I knew {shidi} you wouldn't push back, and this storage pouch is the Fire Forest Jade.
嗯...化尘教近年来不与各派联络，突然找我离火门求购火麟玉，总感觉蹊跷的很。¤Well... In recent years, the Shifting Sands School has not contacted any sects, but suddenly approached my Heavenly Fire Gate to ask for the Fire Spirit Jade, which feels strange.
原来是钟长老当面，失礼了。¤It turned out to be Elder Zhong in person, so I'm sorry for the rudeness.
此剑，你且收着。¤This sword, you shall keep it.
正是晚辈。¤Exactly late.
你是宗门新晋的{FirstName}长老吧。¤You are the newly promoted {FirstName} elder of the clan, right?
嗯？哈哈...¤Hmm? Haha...
（这剑在成胚之时融入了两颗火龙牙，怎么才侃侃达到上品法宝的品阶。）¤(This sword incorporated two fire dragon teeth when it was embryonic, how come it only kan reach the rank of a top grade magic treasure.)
我绝焰堂本就人丁稀少，最近本门附近也不太平，确实是分不出像{shidi}你这样修为精深又办事牢靠的人了。¤Absolute Flame Hall I'm not sure how many people there are in the area, but I'm not sure how many people there are in the area like you.
那我立刻动身。\n¤Then I will move immediately. \n
麟尊前辈过誉了。¤Senior Lin Zun has overstated his case.
哈哈哈，不说这些了，今日请{shidi}过来除了是例行公事之外，也有一件小事想要劳烦{shidi}。¤Hahahaha, enough of that, apart from the usual business of asking {shidi} to come over today, there is also a small matter that I would like to trouble {shidi} with.
我虽是久居麟庙之内，但对你也是早有耳闻。¤Although I have lived within the Lin Temple for a long time, I have heard a lot about you.
钟长老但说无妨。¤Elder Zhong can say whatever he wants.
道友看来有些面善，是否与我千流岛有些渊源？¤Friends of Taoist seem to be kind, do they have something to do with my Qianliu Island?
你皮笑肉不笑地和他打着太极，你来我往间那修士终于露出不耐烦的神色。¤You laughed and played Tai Chi with him without a smile, and the cultivator finally showed impatient expression when you came to me.
千流岛往来修士众多，道友恐怕是记错了吧。¤There are many cultivators on Qianliu Island, I am afraid that fellow Taoists have a wrong memory.
我的身价再高那也得你有命拿才行！¤No matter how valuable I am, you still have to take it!
道友也不必遮掩了，你的追捕令早已在岛上传遍，怕是你还不清楚自己的身价吧？¤You don't need to hide it, your hunting order has been posted on the island. I'm afraid you still don't know your worth?
我们正准备前往{color=#d0380a}南崖城{/color}，看能不能赶上下一次的拍卖会。¤We are going to {color=#d0380a}South Cliff City{/color} to see if we can catch up with the next auction.
看看我这里有没有你需要的东西吧。¤See if I have what you need.
（惊恐地看着你）你...你有何事？¤(Looking at you in horror) You...what's the matter with you?
（尊敬地看着你）前辈有何吩咐？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you respectfully) What do seniors give? {w}{w=0.5}
（煞气腾腾地看着你）何事？¤(Looking at you fiercely) What's the matter?
我们正准备去附近的海域猎杀海兽，之后再把这批货物运往{color=#d0380a}宁州{/color}。¤We are preparing to hunt sea animals in the nearby waters, and then ship this shipment to {color=#d0380a}Ning Province{/color}.
这次带来的货物都已经出手了，我们正准备返航回{color=#d0380a}蓬莎岛{/color}。¤The goods we brought this time have been delivered, and we are preparing to return to {color=#d0380a}Pongsha Island{/color}.
当然，如果你愿意分担我一部分修理灵舟的费用，大概是{color=#d0380a}2000灵石{/color}，我不介意带你一程。一切顺利的话，我想我们会在{color=#d0380a}一年{/color}后抵达那里。¤Of course, if you are willing to share part of the cost of repairing my spirit boat, probably {color=#d0380a}2000 spirit stone{/color}, I don’t mind taking you a ride. If everything goes well, I think we will be in {color =#d0380a}Arrive there in one year{/color}.
多谢道友。¤Thank you fellow daoists.
我对你的实力与品性都所知甚少，出海本就危机四伏，我不能冒险把你一起带上。¤I know very little of your strength and character, and I cannot risk taking you with me when the sea is already full of crises.
不错，我们的确正在做出海的准备，你打听这个做什么？¤Yes, we are indeed making sea preparations. What do you want to do with this?
（友善地看着你）我听说过你的名字，有什么事么？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you kindly) I have heard of your name, what's the matter? {w}{w=0.5}
当然，如果你愿意分担我一部分修理灵舟的费用，大概是{color=#d0380a}4000灵石{/color}，我不介意带你一程。一切顺利的话，我想我们会在{color=#d0380a}两年{/color}后抵达那里。¤Of course, if you are willing to share part of the cost of repairing my spirit boat, it is probably {color=#d0380a}4000 spirit stone{/color}, I don’t mind taking you a ride. If everything goes well, I think we will be in =#d0380a}Arrived there in two years{/color}.
我们正准备去附近的海域收集一些珍贵的草药，如果运气不差的话，最后我们会在{color=#d0380a}碎星岛{/color}出手这些货物。¤We are preparing to go to the nearby sea to collect some precious herbs. If we are not lucky, we will finally sell these goods on {color=#d0380a}Broken Star Island{/color}.
（提防地看着你）我听说过你的名字，你有何事？¤(Watching you watchfully) I've heard your name, what's the matter with you?
（恭敬地看着你）我听说过前辈的大名，有什么可以效劳的么？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you respectfully) I have heard of senior names, what can I do for you? {w}{w=0.5}
（友好地看着你）我听说过道友你的名号，也许有机会我们也可以合作一番。{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you friendly) I have heard of your name, Fellow Daoist, and maybe we can work together if we have the opportunity. {w}{w=0.5}
（平静地看着你）道友何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you calmly) What's the matter with fellow Daoist? {w}{w=0.5}
（冷漠地看着你）何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you indifferently) What's the matter? {w}{w=0.5}
还有什么事么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Is there anything else? {w}{w=0.5}
当然，参加猎魔试炼也有不小的危险，虽然门派会有相应的奖励补偿，但是否参与还是全凭自愿。距离下一次的猎魔试炼还有一段时间，你可以去找参加过往届试炼的师姐了解情况以后，再作决定。¤Of course, participating in the demon hunting trial is also quite dangerous. Although the sect will have corresponding rewards and compensation, whether to participate is entirely voluntary. There is still a period of time before the next demon hunting trial. You can go find and participate. The sisters of previous trials will make a decision after understanding the situation.
颖儿，你将诸位长老的情况向你{shidi}介绍一下吧。¤Ying'er, please tell you {shidi} about the situation of the elders.
距离下一次的猎魔试炼还有一段时间，你可以去找参加过往届试炼的师姐了解情况以后，再作决定。¤There is still some time before the next demon hunting trial. You can go to the seniors who participated in the previous trials to find out about the situation, and then make a decision.
{xiaozi}，若是想要在英杰会上崭露头角来看看本座的丹药吧。¤{xiaozi}, if you want to make a name for yourself at the Yingjie meeting come and see my seat's Pill.
好贵的价格。¤What an expensive price.
阁下，若是没什么需求还是不要乱转为好。¤Your Excellency, if there is no need, it's better not to change it randomly.
若是能拔得头筹，就是奖励的灵石也比这个多，更不要提还能得到筑基丹了。¤If you can get the top spot, you will be rewarded with more spirit stones than this, not to mention that you will recieve a Foundation Pill.
你感应到远处的山壁下传来一阵剧烈的灵气波动，便连忙去探查。¤You sense a violent aura fluctuation coming from under the distant mountain wall, so you rush to investigate.
只见一名金丹期修士被树藤牢牢缠住，身体也被木刺穿过，血流不止，俨然已经失去了生命气息。¤I saw a Golden Core stage cultivator firmly entangled in the vine, the body pierced by Wood Spikes, and blood flowing everywhere, clearly has been dead for a long while.
见此情形，你二人竟不约而同陷入了沉默。¤Seeing this situation, the two of you actually fell into silence.
只见那团阴气飘落在一块寻常灰白色石头上，不仅没有消散，反而融入那块石头之中。整块石头被染成了深黑色。¤Only to see the mass of Yin Qi floating down on an unusual gray-white stone, not only did not dissipate, but integrated into that stone. The whole stone was dyed deep black.
你刚转身，老爷爷又叫住了你。¤You just turned around, and old grandpa called you again.
可惜…此人若神识再高一些，还尚有一线生机。¤Unfortunately ... this person if the soul sense is higher, there is still a chance of survival.
寻常修士死后，只会立马魂飞魄散，也不知这三冥海上有何玄机，竟能暂时护住其元神。¤After the death of ordinary cultivators, only the soul will immediately fly away, I do not know what mysterious mechanism this three underworld sea, can temporarily protect their original spirit.
看来是机缘巧合之下，这极阴之气与此人残留的元神能量融合在一起，附着到了这块石头之中。¤It seems that by chance, this Extreme Yin Qi fused with this person's residual Yuan Shen energy and attached itself to this stone.
唉…生死有命，既然事已至此，这神阴石你便收下吧。¤Alas... life and death have a destiny, since things have come to this, you can take this divine Yin stone.
等等，你看。¤Wait, look.
是旋龟...可惜...¤It's a spinning turtle... Unfortunately...
这…神阴石竟是这样来的…¤This...divine Yin stone came like this...
几番周折过后，此人的元神终究还是支撑不住，那团包裹着元神的阴气如同菩提花一般飘落。¤After a few twists and turns, the person's genitals finally could not support, the group wrapped around the genitals of the Yin Qi like a linden flower floating down.
眼见事态已没有挽救的余地，你暗自叹了口气，便转过身准备离开此地。¤Seeing that the situation is no longer salvageable, you secretly sighed, then turned around and prepared to leave this place.
你转头一看——四周阴气向他的元神凝集而去，包裹住了他原本应该灰飞烟灭的元神。¤You turn your head and look - the surrounding Yin Qi condenses towards his Yuan Shen and wraps around his Yuan Shen that should have been ashes.
别急，还没完。¤Don't rush, it's not over yet.
能见到此等奇物，倒也算是一种机缘了。先收下此物，日后再仔细研究一番吧。¤It's a chance to see such a strange object. Take this object first, and study it carefully later.
{FirstName}道友，大哥他最近是不是又看了外面卖的什么修仙话本？¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, did my big brother recently read any xianxia novels sold outside?
二叔！是丢了什么贵重物品吗？¤Second Uncle! Did you lose any valuables?
啊！那天我还从其他地方拿了书，可能是记混了！¤Ah! I also took the book from other places that day, maybe it was a joke!
哈哈哈，我猜的，我猜的，我们现在就去把这纸条还给二叔。¤Hahaha, I guessed, I guessed, let's go and return this note to the second uncle now.
倪旭荣，你老实说，这张纸条是从哪来的？你们在谋划些什么？¤Ni Xurong, honestly, where did this note come from? What are you planning?
咦......？这本书我从未在书架上见过，而且此处的古籍书脊处都印有小型阵法，只要带出倪府便会自动传送回书架。你看，此书并无长老堂特有的阵法。¤Huh...? I have never seen this book on the bookshelf, and there are small formations printed on the spine of the ancient books here. As long as you take out the Ni Mansion, it will be automatically sent back to the bookshelf. Look, This book does not have the unique formations of the Presbyterian Church.
但书是在长老堂那里找到的，而纸片在倪旭荣的衣服口袋里，玉简却又在二叔的房间......¤The Danshu was found in the Presbyterian Hall, the paper was in Ni Xurong's pocket, and the jade slip was in the second uncle's room...
既然这样就请你们帮我把它还给二叔吧。¤In this case, please help me return it to my second uncle.
二...二叔过来了！¤Second...Second Uncle is here!
我想起来了，那天二叔去后院时这张纸条从他身上落了下来，我才捡起来他人就没影了。¤I remembered that when my second uncle went to the backyard that day, the note fell from him. I picked it up and the others were gone.
纸条是由那本莫名其妙出现在长老堂的书剪贴而成，倪旭荣说它原本属于二叔。¤The note was cut and pasted from the book that appeared in the Presbyterian Church inexplicably. Ni Xurong said it originally belonged to the second uncle.
什么？拿来给我看看，吃了熊心豹子胆敢毁坏长老堂的古籍！¤What? Bring it to me. After eating the bear heart, the leopard dared to destroy the ancient books of the Presbyterian Church!
这纸条不是你的吗，怎么可能只看着眼熟？¤Isn't this note yours, how can you just look familiar?
经过这几天的调查，你¤After several days of investigation, you
可二叔打听戮仙剑又是为了什么呢......？¤But the second uncle asked what the Immortal Executing Sword was for...?
大哥，{FirstName}道友，你们怎么来了？¤Brother, {FirstName} fellow Taoist, why are you here?
二长老闻言脸色有些不自然，略显紧张地从倪旭欣手中接过信件读了起来。¤The second elder's expression was a little unnatural, and he took the letter from Ni XuXin with a little nervousness and read it.
也？还有什么东西不是我的？话说回来，大哥怎么如此确信纸条是我的东西......？¤Also? Is there anything else that is not mine? By the way, how can my eldest brother be so sure that the note is mine...?
我们这就去找长老问问吧！¤Let's go to the elder and ask!
是旭欣啊，也没什么大不了的，丢了个小物件儿。¤It's Xuxin, it's not a big deal, I lost a small object.
倪旭欣清了清嗓负手而立，装作一副严肃的样子。¤Ni XuXin cleared her throat and stood with her hands, pretending to be serious.
虽然倪旭荣过于刻板也是个问题，但这个话题我们下次再讨论吧。¤Although Ni Xurong is too rigid is also a problem, but we will discuss this topic next time.
既然如此，我们不妨也搜寻一下戮仙剑的消息，或许就能知道玄微剑仙所求何物了。¤In this case, we might as well search for the news about the Immortal Executing Sword, and perhaps we can know what Xuanwei Sword Fairy is asking for.
按着玉简上的数字裁下书上的字便可拼成那张纸条，虽然是在长老堂发现此书，但它却并不属于长老堂。¤Cut out the words on the book according to the numbers on the jade slip to form the piece of paper. Although the book was found in the Presbyterian Church, it does not belong to the Presbyterian Church.
对了，那天我去拿书的时候还捡到了这封信。¤By the way, I found this letter when I went to get the book that day.
不敢，你小子有什么不敢的！别在老夫眼前乱晃了，快回去好好修炼吧！¤Don't dare, what do you dare not do! Don't mess around in front of the old man's eyes, go back and practice hard!
想来行事之人应该是怕读取玉简的灵力波动外泄，通过此法即使玉简落入他人手中，单凭一些无意义的数字与方位也无法获得准确的情报。¤Those who want to come to do something should be afraid of reading the jade slips from fluctuating spiritual power. Even if the jade slips fall into the hands of others, they will not be able to obtain accurate information based on meaningless numbers and directions.
玉简里的讯息是一串数字，幸好小爷足够机智，发现了它和书本以及纸条的关联。¤The message in the jade slip is a string of numbers. Fortunately, the little master is witty enough to discover the connection between it and the book and the slip of paper.
什么？！¤what?!
先前发现的玉简和书本整合而成的暗号纸条属于二叔，我们在后院遇见二叔时他行迹鬼祟，应该就是在寻找那张纸条。¤The secret code note formed by the integration of the jade slips and the book previously discovered belongs to the second uncle. When we met the second uncle in the backyard, he was sneaky and probably was looking for the note.
玄微剑仙仿佛在寻找什么，并没发现你们。¤Xuanwei Jianxian seemed to be looking for something, but didn't find you.
不知道这小子跑到什么地方去了...不过无外乎就是修炼，用饭和读书。这个时间他应该在用午膳，去房间看看吧。¤I don't know where this kid has gone...but it's nothing more than cultivation, eating and reading. He should be eating lunch at this time. Let's go to the room.
你不会真的是在外面看了什么修仙话本吧？¤You didn't really read a fairy tale book outside, did you?
先前你给我的那本书和纸片！纸片上的字可以和书上的漏洞对应上！而玉简里的内容就是那些字于书中的具体位置！¤The book and paper you gave me earlier! The words on the paper can correspond to the loopholes in the book! And the content in the jade slip is the specific location of those words in the book!
难道他们正在计划什么...？不行，我们得试探一下他们看看究竟怎么回事。¤Are they planning something...? No, we have to test them to see what's going on.
你认为倪家或许存在问题的人是¤Do you think the Ni family may have problems
你和倪旭欣一同来到长老堂。¤You and Ni XuXin came to the Presbyterian Church together.
...我看{FirstName}{xiongdi}倒是有点不正常。¤...I think {FirstName}{xiongdi} is a bit abnormal.
闻言玄微剑仙神色微变，连忙摆了摆手拒绝掉你们的好意，然后一个人走向了后院。¤Wen Yan Xuan Wei Jianxian's expression changed slightly, and he waved his hand quickly to reject your kindness, and then walked to the backyard alone.
纸片也不是你的？¤Nor is the piece of paper yours?
玉简...对啊，这东西不能拿出来！¤Yu Jian...Yes, this thing can't be taken out!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}还有什么想不通的地方吗？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} Is there anything else I can't figure out?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}与我所想不谋而合！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} coincides with what I want!
你二叔好像在找什么东西。¤Your second uncle seems to be looking for something.
倪旭欣和你灰头土脸地离开了长老堂。¤Ni XuXin and you left the presbytery in disgrace.
人多力量大，不如我们也来帮忙吧。¤There are so many people and powerful, why don't we come and help.
二长老，你在这儿太好了！我前些日子想找些典籍看，正巧那边的书架上有便拿了回去。可我回房翻开书里面被划得不成样子，跟本没法读！¤Second elder, it’s great that you are here! I was looking for some classics a few days ago, but I happened to take them back from the bookshelf over there. But when I went back to the room, I opened the book and it was so badly marked. Law reading!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}说得有理，不过比起我还是差上那么一点！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} makes sense, but it's still a bit worse than me!
倪旭荣放下碗筷，神色古怪地看了看倪旭欣，紧接着向你投来询问的目光。¤Ni Xurong put down the bowls and chopsticks, looked at Ni XuXin with a weird look, and then cast you an inquiring look.
天蝉灵叶...到底是用来做什么的呢？¤Skyscada Leaf...what exactly can it be used for?
没有，没有！长老堂的信我哪敢擅自拆阅！¤No, no! How can I read the letter of the Presbyterian Church without authorization!
长老有什么不正常的地方吗？{FirstName}{xiongdi}还是再想想吧。¤Is there anything abnormal about the elders? {FirstName}{xiongdi} think about it again.
倪兄，你打算怎么问玄微剑仙？¤Brother Ni, how do you plan to ask Xuanwei Jianxian?
信里的内容你读过了？¤Have you read the content of the letter?
什么事大惊小怪的？¤What's all the fuss about?
你决定要找谁谈谈？¤Who do you decide to talk to?
不过那张纸条我倒是有些眼熟......¤But that note is familiar to me...
小友不知是否愿入我麾下？{w}{w=0.5}¤Little friend, do you want to join me? {w}{w=0.5}
甚好，甚好！本王即刻派人安排小友的住处，你便跟着管事去罢。¤Very good, very good! This king will immediately send someone to arrange a place for the little friend, so you can follow the steward.
呵呵呵，那些在外界绝世稀有的宝物秘籍都不过是本王最普通的藏品。只要你对本王有用，本王所有的荣华富贵都可以与你一同分享。¤Hehehe, those treasures and cheats that are rare in the outside world are just the king's most common collection. As long as you are useful to this king, all of this king's glory and wealth can be shared with you.
如有不满，小友现在就可以自行离去，本王绝不限制你的行动。¤If you are dissatisfied, the little friend can leave by himself now, and this king will never restrict your actions.
可惜，可惜...既然如此，本王也不强求。来人，送客！¤It's a pity, it's a pity... In that case, the king doesn't force it. Come and see off!
为本王效力的这段时间里，你只需要替本王寻觅长生之术，并代本王前去辨别消息真伪。若有需要你办的事，本王自然让府里的管事通知于你。¤During the time that you are working for this king, you only need to find the magic of longevity for this king, and to distinguish the authenticity of the news on behalf of this king. If there is something you need to do, this king will naturally let the steward of the house notify To you.
道友既然来了，何再不与韩某过上两招？¤Since Fellow Daoist is here, why don't you have two tricks with Han?
阁下可敢试试，自己能接韩某几招？¤You dare to try, how can you pick up Han?
既然小辈奈何不得你，就由本座出手吧，¤Since the junior can't help you, let me do it,
呼~~这天机阁果真不好惹，还是走为上策。¤Huh~~This Heavens Secrets Pavilion is really not easy to provoke, so it is the best policy to take it.
哼~这天机阁的执事不过如此嘛。¤Hmph~ The deacon of Heavens Secrets Pavilion is nothing more than that.
岩壁上一道奇异的光泽引起了你的注意...原来是{SayStcVal=948}。¤A strange luster on the rock wall caught your attention... It turned out to be {SayStcVal=948}.
此地有一块奇石会吸收你的神念，在释放而出，受此启发，你对神之道有所感悟。¤There is a strange stone here that will absorb your divine mind and release it. Inspired by this, you have an understanding of the way of God.
眼前熔火生生不息，你对火之道有所感悟。¤The melting fire in front of you is endless, you have an understanding of the way of fire.
此地地形甚是奇特，灵气流动不断轮转，生生不息，受此启发，你对气之道有所感悟。¤The terrain here is very peculiar, and the flow of spiritual energy is constantly rotating and endless. Inspired by this, you have an understanding of the way of qi.
此地有一道裂隙，宛若一道剑痕，你对剑之道有所感悟。¤There is a fissure here, like a sword mark, you have a sense of the way of the sword.
眼前藤蔓枯萎生长，轮回交替不止，你对木之道有所感悟。¤The vines wither and grow in front of you, and the cycle of reincarnation does not stop. You have an understanding of the way of wood.
眼前水流奔腾不息，你对水之道有所感悟。¤The current is surging in front of you, and you have a sense of the way of water.
眼前金石甚是锐利，你对金之道有所感悟。¤The gold and stone in front of you are very sharp. You have an understanding of the way of gold.
眼前山石散去化沙，你对土之道有所感悟。¤The rocks in front of you are scattered and turned into sand, and you have a sense of the way of the earth.
我们快去找正主吧。¤Let's go find the Lord.
糟了...宫主恐怕已经...¤Oops... The Palace Master is probably already...
阵法好像被解除了，好厉害。¤The formation seems to have been lifted, which is amazing.
只听轰的一声，尔后便是有什么碎裂开来，原本阵法空间中充斥着的哀嚎悲啸尽是消融，满眼的昏暗也是自东北向西南退却而去。¤Just hearing a bang, and then something shattered. The original formation space filled with mourning and screaming melted away, and the darkness in the eyes also retreated from the northeast to the southwest.
嗯，尖啸声减弱了。¤Well, the screeching has subsided.
阵法好像有些变化。¤The formation seems to have changed a bit.
之前感应到的战斗波动好像停下了...¤The battle fluctuations I sensed before seem to have stopped...
嗯，阵法空间没那么昏暗了。¤Well, the formation space is not so dark anymore.
{FirstName}师弟，你要接取哪个任务？¤Brother {FirstName}, which mission do you want to take?
幽州的魔道之首？¤The head of the magic way in You Province?
我明白了。¤I understand.
任务奖励你且收好，待我上报宗门。¤The task will reward you and take it away, and I will report it to the sect.
师弟，回来的正好。这是本来要奖励你的灵石。李师兄，也在找你。¤Brother, it's just right to come back. This is the spirit stone that was supposed to reward you. Senior Brother Li, I'm also looking for you.
{FirstName}师弟，目前没有需要外门弟子的任务了。¤Brother {FirstName}, there are no quests that require outer disciples at the moment.
我已查探清楚，是有人在猎捕凡人和低阶散修，疑似是魔门的人。¤I have found out that someone is hunting mortals and low-level independent cultivators, who are suspected of being a magician.
师弟，师弟可有眉目？¤Junior, can you have any eyebrows?
不过，这一次和你为敌的修士，根据我对现场的查看却是是天魔道的修士。¤However, the cultivator who is your enemy this time, according to my inspection of the scene, is a cultivator from the Heavenly Demon Dao.
嗯，我已经备案了，在师弟你有结果之前，其他弟子不会插手你的任务。¤Well, I have already filed it. Until Junior Brother, you have a result, other disciples will not interfere with your task.
近来广陵城附近屡屡有人失踪，需要弟子调查。\n\n¤Recently, there have been frequent disappearances near Guangling City, and disciples need to investigate.\n\n
那我就出发了。¤Then I will set off.
嗯，我已经备案了，在师弟你有结果之前，其他弟子不会插手你的任务。\n传闻九嶷山有些邪修出没，{FirstName}师弟，你小心行事。¤Well, I have already filed it. Until Junior Brother you have the result, other disciples will not intervene in your mission. \n It is rumored that there are some evil cultivator in Jiuyi Mountain, Junior Brother {FirstName}, you should be careful.
正是，我执事堂有不少任务需要人手，不过师弟也要量力而行啊。¤Exactly, there are many tasks in my deacon hall that require manpower, but the juniors have to do what they can.
多谢师兄关心，那我就出发了。¤Thank you brother for your concern, then I will set off.
御剑门哪里的异动可有眉目了？\n¤Where is the change in Imperial Sword Sect? \n
本门方壶山灵石矿脉有不明修士踪迹，需要增派弟子巡逻。\n\n¤There are traces of unidentified cultivators in the Square Cauldron Mountain spirit stone vein of the main gate, and more disciples need to be patrolled.\n\n
九嶷山御剑门遗址似有异动需要查探。\n\n¤The ruins of Imperial Sword Sect in Jiuyi Mountain seem to have changed and need to be investigated.\n\n
嗯，正是。这次你对宗门有功，这枚养气丹，你且收好。¤Yes, well done. Take this Lesser Qi Pill for your services to the sect.
广陵城的人口失踪可有眉目了？¤Does the disappearance of the population of Guangling City seem obvious?
师弟很是面生，可是新入门的弟子。¤The younger brother is very face-to-face, but he is a new beginner disciple.
多谢师兄。¤Thank you brother.
我已查探清楚，是有御剑门遗迹的法阵波动，并无大事发生。¤I have found out that there is a wave of the magic circle with the ruins of the Imperial Sword Sect, and no major incident has occurred.
{FirstName}师弟，是来执行任务的吗？¤Brother {FirstName}, are you here to perform the task?
此次，你得知古神教的踪迹对宗门实属大功一件，但此事不宜打草惊蛇所以就没有大肆宣扬。¤This time, you learned that the traces of the ancient gods were a great contribution to the sect, but this matter should not be blatantly promoted.
我最近刚刚入门，听闻师兄这里可以接取任务？¤I just started getting started recently. I heard that Brother can accept tasks here?
我已传信方壶山执事堂，你还是快快前去为好。¤I have sent a letter to Fang Hushan Deacon's Hall, you'd better go quickly.
师弟，接下来的事宜就由我单独和{FirstName}师弟谈谈吧。¤Junior, the next matter is for me to discuss with {FirstName} Jr.
多谢师兄了。¤Thank you brother.
请问师兄，目前可有适合外门弟子的任务？¤Excuse me, brother, is there a task suitable for outside disciples at the moment?
我已传信方壶山执事堂，你直接过去找负责矿脉的执事就好了。¤I have sent a letter to Square Cauldron Mountain Deacon's Hall, so you can go directly to find the deacon in charge of the mineral vein.
承让了。¤Accepted.
甘拜下风。¤Can't wait for the wind.
我们正准备把货物运回{color=#d0380a}南崖城{/color}。¤We are preparing to ship the goods back to {color=#d0380a}South Cliff City{/color}.
我们的商队正准备去附近的海域收购材料，之后再把这批货物运往{color=#d0380a}宁州{/color}。¤Our caravan is preparing to go to nearby seas to purchase materials, and then ship the goods to {color=#d0380a}Ning Province{/color}.
我们的商队正准备出发前往{color=#d0380a}蓬莎岛{/color}，去那里的坊市收购一些材料。¤Our caravan is preparing to set off to {color=#d0380a}Pongsha Island{/color} and go to the market there to buy some materials.
这次要收购的物资已经差不多了，我们正准备返回{color=#d0380a}碎星岛{/color}。¤The materials to be acquired this time are almost complete, and we are preparing to return to {color=#d0380a}Broken Star Island{/color}.
多谢指点。¤Thanks for your advice.
嗯...要说起这古原城嘛，就得从一万年前宁州的那场正魔大战说起了。¤Well ... To talk about the ancient original city, it is necessary to start from 10,000 years ago in Ning Province, the battle between the righteous and the devil.
古原城？¤Ancient Plains City?
这万年来不知有多少奇珍异宝和传承功法在宁州失传，恐怕也只有进入宁州古迹之中才有可能寻到。如此机缘，各大门派当然不会错过。¤Over the past ten thousand years, there have been many exotic treasures and inherited techniques lost in Ning Province, and I am afraid that the only way to find them is to enter the monuments in Ning Province. Of course, the great sects would not miss such an opportunity.
古代城池遗迹？我还从未听说过宁州有这样的地方。¤The remains of an ancient city? I've never heard of such a place in Ning Province.
我在古籍中看到了有关古代城池遗迹的记载，这遗迹...应该就在宁州，你可曾听说过？¤I've read about the remains of an ancient city in an ancient book, and this remains... I think it's in Ning Province, have you ever heard of it?
哈哈哈，我虽然也未曾进入过这古迹。不过听闻每次古迹开启之时，宁州各地{color=#d0380a}元婴期{/color}以上修为的修士大都会进入探索一番。¤I have never entered this monument either. But I heard that every time the monument opens, most cultivators from all over Ning Province {color=#d0380a} above the YuanYing stage {/color} will enter and explore a bit.
当年魔道入侵宁州，目标直指作为宁州第一大城的古原城，在那里发生了一场规模浩荡的大战，连化神老祖都参与其中。¤Back then, the Devil's Dao invaded Ning Province, targeting Gu Yuan City, which is the number one city in Ning Province, and a massive battle took place there, involving even the Elder Deity Transformation Ancestors.
按往年的记录，这薄弱之处往往会出现在{color=#d0380a}岫络谷{/color}的附近。此时修为高深者便可尝试强行穿越这空间壁垒，从而进入古迹。¤According to the records of previous years, this weak spot tends to appear near the {color=#d0380a}Sulo Valley{/color}. At this point, those with high levels of cultivation can attempt to force their way through this spatial barrier and thus enter the monument.
由于战斗过于激烈，以至于产宁州古迹如今已经陷入空间裂隙之中，要想进入那片空间，唯有趁{color=#d0380a}千年{/color}一次空间壁障薄弱时强行闯入。¤The battle was so fierce that the monuments of the Ning Province are now caught in a spatial rift, and the only way to enter that space is to force your way in while the {color=#d0380a} once in a thousand years{/color} spatial barriers are weak.
整座城池都被卷入另外一处位面，真是闻所未闻...¤It is unheard of for an entire city to be caught up in another dimension...
我在古籍中看到了有关古代城池遗迹的记载，这遗迹...应该就在宁州，道友可曾听说过？¤I've read about the remains of an ancient city in an ancient book, and this ruin... It should be in Ning Province, have you ever heard of it?
另外一片位面？那要如何才能进入这座古迹？¤Another realm? And how do I get into this monument?
由于战斗过于激烈，以至于产生了恐怖的空间裂隙，最终连同整座古原城一起，都被卷到了另外一片位面。¤The battle was so fierce that it created a terrifying spatial rift, which eventually swept away to another realm, along with the entire ancient original city.
古代城池遗迹...莫非{$TmpTalkString}说的是那古原城？¤The remains of an ancient city... Could it be that {$TmpTalkString} is talking about the ancient original city?
要买什么自己挑。¤Choose what you want to buy.
听说隔壁那个摊位卖的丹药，吃了会拉肚子。¤I heard that the pill sold at the stall next door will cause diarrhea.
你到底买不买？？¤Are you buying or not?
山里海里，水里火里，只要是灵气荟萃之地，都可能孕育天材地宝。能不能得到，那就各凭本事了。¤In the mountains and in the sea, in the water and in the fire, as long as it is a place where spiritual energy is gathered, it may nurture the treasures of the heavens and the earth. Whether it can be obtained or not depends on its own ability.
这些炼器材料都是从哪里获得的？¤Where did these refining materials come from?
随便看，随便挑。¤Look and choose whatever you want.
东石谷最好的宝贝都在这儿了。¤East Stone Valley's best babies are here.
请随意挑选¤Please choose whatever you want
道友，看看有什么需要的？¤Friends, see what you need?
要买什么？¤what to buy?
走过路过不要错过！¤Do not miss passing through!
价廉物美，看看您要什么？¤It's cheap and good. See what you want?
这位道友，有什么看上的东西？¤This fellow Taoist, what do you like?
虽是许久无人维护，但是你仍可以看出此地是洞府主人的藏书之地。¤Although it has been unmaintained for a long time, you can still tell that this place is the book collection place of the master of the cave.
此地看上去废弃已久，看看还有什么有价值的东西。¤This place looks abandoned for a long time, let's see what else is of value.
此地看上去乃是有主之地，我还是不要乱动为好。¤This place seems to be a land of masters, I'd better not mess around.
你决定......¤You decide......
你发现一处被阵法隐匿的暗格，打开后是一份秘籍。¤You found a secret grid hidden by the formation, after opening it is a secret book.
当然去过了！怎么问起这个？¤Of course I have been! Why do you ask about this?
那把剑的去处倪兄可知？¤Does Brother Ni know where the sword goes?
倪兄可曾见过一把剑？¤Brother Ni has ever seen a sword?
你去过倪家主的卧房吗？¤Have you been to Patriarch Ni's bedroom?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，调查有什么结果吗？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, are there any results from the survey?
天色已晚，我先回自己的房间了，我们明天再聊。¤It's getting late, I'll go back to my room first, and we will talk tomorrow.
什么去处？难道不就挂在我爹居室的墙上吗？¤Where to go? Isn't it just hanging on the wall of my father's room?
你说的是挂在墙上的那把吧？别提了，我小时候见它不俗便想摘下来耍一通，还没摸到剑鞘就被我爹好一顿收拾，自此长了记性是再也不敢碰了。¤You're talking about the one hanging on the wall? Don't mention it. When I was a kid, I saw it was good and wanted to take it off and play a trick. Before I could touch the scabbard, my father had a good meal to clean it up. Since then, I have a long memory. I don't dare to touch it again.
对了，除此之外还有张奇怪的地图，倪兄能看出来这是哪里吗？¤By the way, there is a strange map besides this. Can Brother Ni see where this is?
我也看不太懂，上面好像有我爹常用的密文......等他平安回来倒是可以问问他。¤I can't understand it either. It seems that there are ciphertexts that my father often uses...When he comes back safely, you can ask him.
不见了...可能是我爹闭关的时候把它带走了吧......¤It's gone...maybe my dad took it away when he was in retreat...
你将卧室里的见闻说给倪旭欣。¤You tell Ni XuXin what you have seen in the bedroom.
一入山洞，妖兽特有的腥膻气味扑面而来。¤As soon as I entered the cave, the fishy smell peculiar to the monster beast came upon my face.
哇！这里的妖兽一定不少，难怪成为一方祸害！¤Wow! There must be a lot of monsters here, no wonder it has become a scourge!
沂山派也不过如此，你们一起上好了！¤The Yishan School is nothing but this, you guys are ready to go together!
好险好险...这沂山派的杂鱼也不是那么容易对付的嘛。¤Good risk, good risk... This Yishan school miscellaneous fish is not so easy to deal with.
百里一族无法完美掌握《太上化龙诀》的原因就在于身体，若取得龙珠即可改善体质，如我龙族一般如鱼得水地修练此诀。¤The reason why the Hundred Mile clan can't perfectly master the 《Supreme Draconic Transformation Art》 is because of the body. If you get a dragon pearl, you can improve your physical fitness. Just like my dragon race, you can practice this art like the fish swim in the sea.
祖父他不会是...窃走了龙珠吧？¤Grandfather he wouldn't be... stole the Dragon Ball, right?
那我们这便启航吧！¤Then let's set sail!
这是?¤this is?
我族一气之下联合众海兽攻向广陵城，却不知百里武如何说动广陵城中权贵，筑起内外两道城墙，白白牺牲平民百姓的性命。我们海兽也不愿殃及无辜，几番进攻无果后最终也只得作罢。¤Our clan united with all the sea beasts to attack Guangling City in a fit of anger, but I don’t know how Bailiwu moved the dignitaries in Guangling City, built two walls inside and outside, and sacrificed the lives of the common people in vain. Our sea beasts did not want to harm the innocent, and attacked several times. After fruitless, I finally had to give up.
黑心盗取宗门至宝嗜血珠，天邪子奉命追击，尔等酌情配合。¤Hei Xin steals the sect's most precious bloodthirsty bead, and Tian Xie Zi is ordered to pursue it, and you will cooperate as appropriate.
好吧，这下都对上了。¤Well, it's all right now.
传送阵，而且是专门用来传送记事玉简的小型传送阵，灵气波动很小极难被察觉。¤The teleportation array, and it is a small teleportation array specially used to transmit the jade slips of notes, the aura fluctuations are very small and it is difficult to be noticed.
我等又岂是那蛮横不讲理之人，看在旧日情分只要他归还龙珠便不计前嫌。岂料百里武这厮，竟直接带着龙珠举族迁至宁州广陵城！¤How can I be the arrogant and unreasonable person? In the old days, as long as he returned the dragon ball, it would be ignored. Unexpectedly, the servant of Bailiwu directly moved the dragon ball clan to Guangling City in Ning Province!
我来看看有什么发现？¤Let me see what I found?
旧时百里族与龙族常有商贸往来，彼此间关系融洽，百里族长老同龙族长老甚至携手创出功法《太上化龙诀》。此功法龙族中化形者修练得心应手，如虎添翼，百里族人却因种族差异修练起来稍逊几分。¤In the old days, the Baili tribe and the dragon tribe often had business contacts, and the relationship between them was harmonious. The elders of the Baili tribe and the dragon tribe even jointly created the exercise Tai Shang Hua Long Jue. Like a tiger with more wings, the Baili people are a bit inferior in practice due to racial differences.
这是?传送阵？¤This is? Teleportation Array?
加之广陵城与碎星岛为了调和两族矛盾让了些好处予我们，我们才应承只要百里族人不踏入龙族所在的海域就不会再掀起兽潮。¤In addition, Guangling City and Broken Star Island gave us some benefits in order to reconcile the contradictions between the two races, and we promised that as long as the Baili tribe did not step into the sea where the dragon tribe was located, there would be no more beast tides.
这阵法乃是龙族所布，只要有百里族人踏入院内便会发出警示，因此龙昌海才会前去捉捕你们。¤This formation was deployed by the Dragon Clan. As long as a member of the Baili Clan enters the hospital, a warning will be issued, so Long Changhai will go to arrest you.
化尘教已察觉不对，渗透计划暂缓。¤Huachenjiao has noticed something wrong, and the infiltration plan has been suspended.
所以，这就是他们联络总部的方式吧。¤So, this is how they contact the headquarters.
是的，专门用来传送记事玉简的小型传送阵，灵气波动很小极难被察觉。¤Yes, the small teleportation array specially used to transmit the jade slips of the memoirs has very little aura fluctuations and is extremely difficult to detect.
看在你们对龙族并无加害之心的份上今日便放过你二人，切莫再到碎星岛来了。¤For the sake of your innocence towards the Dragon Race, I will spare you two today, and don't come to Broken Star Island again.
哼，不仅如此。当时龙太子念旧情要他交还龙珠，他一口否认此事，还出手把龙太子打成重伤！¤Huh, not only that. At that time, the Dragon Prince wanted him to return the Dragon Ball, he denied it, and shot the Dragon Prince seriously!
既然如此，我便先回到蓬莎岛与族中商队汇合。不知{FirstName}{xiongdi}接下来的打算是...{w}{w=0.5}¤In that case, I will first return to Pongsha Island and join the caravan in the tribe. I don't know what {FirstName}{xiongdi} plans to do next...{w}{w=0.5}
如此我便等你五年，不论结果如何你都要回到化龙海域告知于我。¤So I will wait for you for five years, no matter what the result is, you will return to the Dragonborn Sea to inform me.
百里武因与龙太子关系颇好，时常来龙族作客。偶然间得知我龙族秘宝有着将寻常修士凡胎肉体化为与龙族相匹的强劲体魄后，他便产生了邪念。¤Bai Li Wu Yin has a very good relationship with the Dragon Prince, and he often visits the Dragon Clan as a guest. After accidentally learning that my Dragon Clan's Secret Treasure has a strong physique that turns the mortal body of an ordinary cultivator into a dragon clan, he developed evil thoughts.
没想到广陵城兽潮的罪魁祸首居然是祖父...¤Unexpectedly, the grandfather was the chief culprit of the beast in Guangling City...
霍~~这气息，魔神蛊啊，又是古神教。¤Huo~~ This breath, Demon God Gu, is another ancient god.
那我们就此分别吧！¤Then let's separate now!
此地只是一个简单的洞穴，但有一具尸体倒在正中。¤The place is a simple cave, but there is a body fallen right in the middle of it.
这是...记事玉简！还有两个。¤This is... the jade slip of a note! There are two more.
看来也没有其他的线索了，先回白帝楼复命吧。¤It seems that there are no other clues, so let's go back to Baidilou first.
前辈，此事本是我祖父之过，待我回到广陵城后定劝说他奉还龙珠。¤Senior, this is my grandfather's fault. When I return to Guangling City, I will persuade him to return the Dragon Ball.
哼，看来百里武这家伙并没告诉后代他当年做的好事啊！¤Hmph, it seems that Bailiwu didn't tell his descendants the good things he did in those days!
看衣着是化尘教弟子。¤Looking at the clothes is a disciple of Huachen teaches.
百里武与我族太子原本是儿时玩伴，没想到为了自身前途竟做出此等离心离德之事！¤Bailiwu and the prince of my clan were originally childhood playmates, but I didn't expect to do such a renunciation for their own future!
桀桀桀桀桀...又有新鲜的魂魄送上门来了。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie... Another fresh soul is delivered to the door.
碎星岛上以商队居多，他们经常会以丰厚的报酬聘请修士护送船队前往目的地。先前正好有一队商人往宁州运货，我便跟着他们回来了。¤There are mostly caravans on Broken Star Island. They often hire cultivators to escort the fleet to their destinations with generous remuneration. There happened to be a group of merchants to ship goods to Ning Province, and I followed them back.
好险，这青面鬼果然厉害。¤Good risk, this green-faced ghost is really powerful.
今日灭这沂山派，也算功德一件。¤To destroy this Yishan faction today is also a merit.
咳咳...¤Ahem...
好了，你不必担心老夫的情况，倒是自己得更加小心。¤You see that the disciples below are following the steps, and although some are struggling there are no accidents.
这么看来，五大门派与民间传闻皆煞有其事的指责御剑门掌门勾结魔门...¤So it seems that the five great sects and the rumour mill are all accusing the Royal Sword Sect of colluding with the Demon Sect...
此等机缘不可强求，你若有心，多多留意便是。¤Such opportunities cannot be forced, so if you are so inclined, just keep an eye out for them.
当年为了摆脱魔神蛊的控制，我确实施展秘术将自己的魂魄反向融入了诛仙剑中。虽然并非我本意，但诛仙剑确实是被我的魂魄所封印，我也因此失去了大部分的记忆。¤Back then, in order to escape the control of the Demon God Compulsion, I did use a secret technique to reverse my soul into the Immortal Punishing Sword. Although it was not my intention, the Immortal Punishing Sword was indeed sealed by my soul, and I lost most of my memories as a result.
你是说九嶷山那个遗迹？¤You mean the ruins of Jiuyi Mountain?
上次遇到的剑灵让我觉得有些眼熟...调查一下此剑或许会有新的线索。¤The sword spirit I met last time made me feel a bit familiar... Investigating this sword may reveal new clues.
御剑门...私通魔门...被五大门派围攻...¤The Royal Sword Sect... The devil's clan... Besieged by five major sects...
你可曾听说过九嶷山的御剑门？¤Have you ever heard of the Imperial Sword Sect in Jiuyi Mountain?
这宁州古迹中或许不乏已经绝迹多年的宝物和功法，但想要在古迹中有所机缘，实力与情报缺一不可。¤There may be many treasures and techniques that have been extinct for many years in this Ning Province monument, but strength and intelligence are indispensable if you want to have a chance in the monument.
既然如此，那我便继续四处打听一番吧，或许能帮你想起些什么。¤In that case, I'll keep asking around a bit and maybe I can help you remember something.
魏老，你放心。待我飞升时，一定能帮您重塑肉身的。¤Old Wei, don't worry. When I ascend, I will definitely be able to help you reshape your physical body.
魏老神魂虚弱，这段时间还是先不要打扰他了...¤Elder Wei's soul is weak, so it's better not to disturb him for the time being...
当年战况紧急，老夫出手之时轩儿已经战至力竭昏迷，只得命几名弟子护送他离去。没想到最后他竟是被血剑宫的人救了...¤The battle was so urgent that I had to order a few of my disciples to escort him away as he had already fainted from the battle. I never thought that he would be saved by the Blood Sword Palace...
多数灵剑都仰赖天地灵气提升品质，这把剑却依靠魔气提升......¤Most spirit swords rely on the spirit of heaven and earth to improve their quality, but this sword relies on demonic energy to improve...
我有预感，离揭开真相的那一天已经越来越近了...¤I have a feeling that the day is approaching when the truth will be revealed...
想直接打听到有关魔门的线索恐怕不太容易，平日里也{color=#d0380a}多多留心{/color}吧。¤I'm afraid it's not easy to ask for direct clues about the Demon Gate, so I'll {color=#d0380a} keep an eye out for them during the week{/color}.
嗯，这些年来我们也算收集了不少线索。我有预感，离揭开真相的那一天已经越来越近了。¤Well, we've collected quite a few clues over the years. I have a feeling that the day is getting closer and closer to uncovering the truth.
唉...此事说来话长，待我与你细细道来。¤Oh...this is a long story, wait for me to tell you carefully.
老头，你有想起什么么？¤Old man, do you remember anything?
我依稀回忆起一些有关{color=#d0380a}御剑门{/color}和{color=#d0380a}古代城池遗迹{/color}的回忆...多{color=#d0380a}打听{/color}一下与此有关的传闻，或许能帮助我尽快恢复记忆...¤I vaguely recall some memories of {color=#d0380a}the Royal Sword Gate{/color} and {color=#d0380a}the ruins of the ancient city{/color}... Asking more {color=#d0380a}about{/color}the rumors related to this might help me recover my memory soon...
最让我担心的其实是这柄剑。¤What worries me the most is this sword.
当时我原本已经到了炼化诛仙剑的关键时刻，但为了保护门内弟子，却不得不强行出手。被那魔神蛊乘虚而入，导致魔气入体，功亏一篑。¤At that time, I had already reached the critical moment to refine the Immortal Punishing Sword, but I had to force my way out in order to protect the disciples of the sect. The Devil God Compulsion took advantage of the situation and caused the Devil Qi to enter my body, resulting in a loss of all my efforts.
这段时间老夫虽然无法传音于你，但是对外界多少还能感知一二...轩儿所说之事，老夫还是知晓的。¤Although the old man can not transmit the voice to you, but the outside world can still perceive one or two... Xuan'er said, I still know the matter.
明白了，那接下来便想办法{color=#d0380a}打听一番有关这座古城遗迹的传闻{/color}吧。¤Understood, then the next way to find a way to {color=#d0380a} inquire about the rumors about the ancient ruins of this city {/color}.
无论如何，我都会为你感到骄傲的。¤Either way, I'd be proud of you.
所以后来每当诛仙剑恢复时，我的魂魄也会因此壮大一分。这次也是因为诛仙剑重新恢复了通天灵宝的威能，我才得以恢复记忆。¤So whenever the Immortal Punishing Sword was restored later on, my soul would also grow a little stronger as a result. This time, it was also because the Exorcist Sword had regained its power as a Heavenly Spiritual Treasure that I was able to recover my memory.
当年若非因为我执意要带回诛仙剑，又何至于被那古神教利用。¤If it wasn't for my insistence on bringing back the Immortal Punishing Sword back then, why would I have been used by that Ancient God Sect?
老头儿，是不是想起什么了？¤Old man, does something come to mind?
或许天魔眼能给你与老夫一个更为贴近真相的答案。¤Maybe the demon eye can give you and the old man an answer closer to the truth.
这老怪物说的倒是没错。现在想来，那魔神蛊应当在宁州古迹时便已潜伏于魔剑之中，只是我未曾发现。¤What this old monster said was true. Now that I think about it, the Demon God Compulsion should have lurked in the Demon Sword during the Ning Province monument, only that I had not discovered it.
不错，这就是先前你捡到的那把铁剑，也正是...诛仙剑。虽不知为何千年后变成了平平无奇的铁剑，但我能确定当年它同那戮仙剑一般威能不凡。¤Yes, this is the iron sword you picked up earlier, and it is also... the sword of death. Although I don’t know why it became an ordinary iron sword after a thousand years, I can be sure that it is the same as the Immortal Executing Sword. Powerful.
听那恶饕所言，当年你应该也是被古神教暗中种下了魔神蛊。¤From what that evil gourmand said, you should also have been secretly planted with the Demon God Compulsion by the Ancient God Sect back then.
你可还记得先前的御剑门？¤Do you remember the previous Imperial Sword Sect?
那之后发生的事情你可还记得？¤Do you remember what happened after that?
对了，是白帝...是师兄把我们救回南崖城的。当年之事，师兄也大致与我说了一番，可惜你当时还在昏迷，没能亲自和他说上话。¤By the way, it was the White Emperor... It was senior brother who saved us back to South Cliff City. Senior Brother also spoke to me in general about what happened back then, but unfortunately you were still in a coma and couldn't speak to him personally.
再往后发生之事我倒是记不太清了，但唯有一事我可以肯定...{color=#d0380a}我魏无极从未做过那勾结魔门之事！{/color}¤I don't remember much of what happened after that, but there is one thing I can be sure of... {I have never done anything to collude with the demon clan! {/color}
莫非这就是...？¤Could this be...?
一座巨大的古城，一片废墟，各大门派的修士...还有一柄剑...¤A huge ancient city, a ruin, cultivators of various great schools... And a sword...
没想到轩儿...哎...¤I didn't expect Xuan'er... Hey...
我想起了...一些零散的画面...¤I remembered... Some fragmentary images...
一座巨大的古城废墟...各大门派都曾去过...若宁州真有如此规模的古城遗迹，我应该早去过才是。¤A huge ancient city in ruins... All the great sects have been there before... If there really was an ancient city ruin of this size in Ning Province, I should have been there a long time ago.
希望是我多虑了。¤I hope I'm worrying too much.
若这秘阁未被毁去，说不定在其中还能找到些许往日的记载。¤If this secret pavilion had not been destroyed, it might have been possible to find some records of the past in it.
即便他们不来，御剑门的血债也不能就这么算了。与其被动等着他们找上门来，不如把主动权把握在自己手中。¤Even if they don't come, the blood debt of the Imperial Sword Sect cannot just be let go. Rather than passively waiting for them to come to us, we should take the initiative into our own hands.
距离下一次宁州古迹开启还有{$TempValue}年，这古迹虽说有金丹期实力便可进入，但若无元婴期实力，恐怕难以自保。¤There are still {$TempValue} years until the next Ning Province monument opens, and although this monument can be entered with Jindan stage strength, I'm afraid that without Yuanying stage strength, it will be difficult to defend oneself.
还是记不起任何重要的事情，这或许和我的魂魄还比较虚弱有关...¤I still can't remember any important things. This may have something to do with my weak soul...
接下来的这段时间，多多{color=#d0380a}打听和古迹有关的情报{/color}，并且努力{color=#d0380a}提升自己的修为{/color}吧。¤For the next few days, ask for more information about the monuments{/color} and try to {color=#d0380a} improve your cultivation level{/color}.
千年前灭门的门派我哪有可能听说过。¤I have never heard of the sect that destroyed the door thousands of years ago.
哎...其实我能感觉到，施展这秘术对轩儿有不小的影响。索性这次他成功飞升，没有因为我而出什么意外，否则让我如何过意的去。¤Ai... In fact, I can feel that the casting of this secret technique has a considerable impact on Xuan'er. Luckily, he managed to ascend this time without any accidents because of me, otherwise how could I feel sorry for myself?
不错，难得你这{xiaozi}还能记得。¤Yes, it's rare for you {xiaozi} to remember it.
我只剩这一缕残魂，想要找回记忆并不是什么容易的事情。¤I only have this remnant soul. It is not easy to find the memory.
老头！你...你没事了？¤Old man! Are you... You're all right?
剑？是这柄铁剑么？你想起这柄剑的来历了？¤A sword? Is it this iron sword? Do you remember where this sword came from?
我依稀回忆起一些与{color=#d0380a}御剑门{/color}有关的回忆...多{color=#d0380a}打听{/color}一下与此派有关的传闻，或许能帮助我尽快恢复记忆...¤I vaguely recall some memories related to {color=#d0380a}the Royal Sword Sect{/color}... Asking more {color=#d0380a}about{/color}the rumors related to this sect might help me recover my memory soon...
宁州古迹...答案会在那里么...？¤Ning Province historic sites... will the answer be there...?
若是能找到办法{color=#d0380a}壮大我的魂魄{/color}，或是打听到什么{color=#d0380a}过往的消息{/color}，说不定对我能够有所帮助。¤If I can find a way {color=#d0380a} to grow my soul{/color} or enquire about anything {color=#d0380a} from the past{/color}, it might be able to help me.
诛仙剑在我输入灵气后迸发出极为霸道的剑气，震晕了方圆十里的修士，连那多宝塔也变得破败不堪。¤Zhu Xianjian burst out a very domineering sword aura after I input the spiritual energy, stunned the cultivators in a radius of ten miles, and even the pagoda became dilapidated.
没错，我依稀回忆起一些与此派有关的回忆...不知当年我与此派有何瓜葛。¤Yes, I vaguely recall some memories related to this school... I don't know how I had anything to do with this school back then.
那阵法连环相叠，纷杂繁乱，我耗费了几天时间才将其破解。¤The formations are stacked on top of each other, and they are complicated and messy. It took me a few days to crack them.
老头，你是不是想起什么了？¤Old man, are you remembering something?
你这些年听说过什么有关御剑门的传闻吗？¤Have you heard any rumors about Imperial Sword Sect all these years?
并无，说来也怪，吸收魔气的剑极其罕见，但我却一点也想不起与此剑相关之事。¤No, it's weird to say, the sword that absorbs devilish energy is extremely rare, but I can't think of anything related to this sword.
按师兄所言，天魔道最近也不安分，待我回到宁州后，便先去探探他们的虚实。¤According to what my senior brother said, the Heavenly Demon Path has also been restless recently, so when I return to Ning Province, I will first go and explore their reality.
得了诛仙剑那般的宝物，我自不会久留，将率领弟子回到山门之事委托给亲传大弟子后我便打道回府，打算探究一下那把剑的奥妙。¤I won the treasure like the Zhuxian Sword. I won't stay for a long time. After entrusting my disciple to return to the mountain gate to the big disciple, I went back home, intending to explore the mystery of that sword.
难怪...难怪那破塔如此凋敝，竟是因为魏老你。¤No wonder...it's no wonder that the broken tower is so withered because of you, Mr. Wei.
{xiaozi}，先陪老夫再走一遭御剑门吧。门派虽已覆灭，但老夫却想起当年曾在门内设有一处密阁。¤{I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the list. Although the sect has been destroyed, I remembered that there was a secret pavilion within the sect.
{xiaozi}，这段回忆可能对我非常重要。若是能重回这座古城，或许所有有关我身份和这柄铁剑的谜团，就都可以迎刃而解了。¤{xiaozi}, this memory could be very important to me. If I could return to this ancient city, perhaps all the mysteries about my identity and this iron sword could be solved.
需要打听消息时，可在与其他修士对话中选择{color=#d0380a}“我有些事情想问你”{/color}，获得你所需的情报。¤When you need to ask for information, select {color=#d0380a}I have something to ask you{/color} in a conversation with another cultivator to get the information you need.
这些过往传闻对于我恢复记忆确实有些帮助。只是我未曾想到，这御剑门竟是因为私通魔门而灭的...不知我当年重伤躲进这铁剑之中，是否与这场大战有关。¤These past rumours did help me to recover my memory. But I had never imagined that this Royal Sword Sect was destroyed because of the fornication with the Demon Sect... I don't know if my serious injury back then, when I hid in this iron sword, had anything to do with this great battle.
你这{xiaozi}死脑筋一个，早日找回记忆于你我都有帮助，没听说过不会主动打听打听吗！¤You {xiaozi} have a dead brain. Retrieving the memory as soon as possible will help both you and me. If you haven't heard of it, won't you take the initiative to inquire about it!
他还说...你用自己的魂魄封印了诛仙剑。这或许就是你失忆的原因？¤He also said... You used your own soul to seal the Immortal Punishing Sword. Is that perhaps the reason for your memory loss?
仔细算算时间，说不定你便是上一次古迹开启之时，进入其中探索的。¤If you do the maths, you may have entered and explored the monuments when they were last opened.
其实已经过去这么多年，我早就已经放弃这个念想了。只希望你能顺利渡劫飞升，莫要再行这危险之事了。¤In fact, so many years have passed that I have long since given up on this idea. I only hope that you will be able to ascend successfully and will not have to do this dangerous thing again.
我在古原城中一边寻找弟子的下落一边寻求机缘，最终在东边的一处多宝塔那里发现了极其复杂的阵法。¤I was looking for opportunities while looking for the whereabouts of my disciples in the ancient city. Finally, I found an extremely complicated formation at a multi-pagoda in the east.
魏老，师兄此事...¤Elder Wei, the matter of the senior...
魏老，御剑门大仇已报，师兄又成功飞升了，你应该觉得高兴才是。¤Elder Wei, the great revenge of the Royal Sword Sect has been avenged and Senior Brother has successfully ascended, you should feel happy.
千年前宁州古迹开启，我便率一干弟子进入其中求索机缘。我原本备好阵法，待进入古迹后即可与弟子结阵抵御煞气，熟料那古迹内部空间混乱，最后竟无一位弟子与我落于一处。¤Thousands of years ago, when the historic site in Ning Province was opened, I led a group of disciples into it to find opportunities. I originally prepared a formation. Once I entered the historic site, I could form a formation with my disciples to resist the evil spirits. The interior space of the clinker was chaotic. This disciple and I are in the same place.
老头，你刚刚说的诛仙剑是...？¤Old man, what you just said about the Sword of Execution is...?
这传闻中提到的{color=#d0380a}魔门{/color}也令我在意。不管御剑门当年是真的私通魔门，还是背后另有隐情，都与这传闻中的魔门脱不了干系。¤This rumoured {color=#d0380a}Demon Gate{/color} also concerns me. Whether the Royal Sword Sect was really fornicating with the Devil's Clan back then, or if there was something else behind it, it had nothing to do with this rumoured Devil's Clan.
层层叠叠的阵法之下掩藏的，是一柄煞气四溢的灵剑。¤Hidden under the layers of formations is a spirit sword overflowing with evil spirits.
还死不了...不过...此番消耗也着实不小。想要完全恢复，多少还需要一些时日...¤It's not dead yet... But... This is a lot of work. It will take some time to fully recover...
无妨，待日后还要重回御剑门调查一番。¤It doesn't matter, I will return to Imperial Sword Sect to investigate in the future.
如今魔门蠢蠢欲动，只要诛仙剑一日还在你手中，就必须做好与他们正面冲突的准备。¤Nowadays, as long as the Demon Sect is still in your hands, you must be prepared to clash with them head-on.
哎...其实我能感觉到，施展这秘术对轩儿有不小的影响。如若不是为了我，他不会被恶饕偷袭所伤，也不至于渡劫失败...¤Ai... In fact, I can feel that performing this secret technique has a significant impact on Xuan'er. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been injured by the evil gourmets' sneak attack, and he wouldn't have failed to cross the tribulation...
幸而我还有件护体灵符才免于剑气所伤，并趁乱逃出了宁州古迹。¤Fortunately, I still had a protective charm to protect myself from the Sword Qi, and I escaped from the ancient sites of Ning Province in the chaos.
或许这遗迹是被什么禁制封印，也可能是阵法掩盖...不过既然知道了这些特征，去各派打听一番应该就能有所收获了。¤Perhaps the relic is sealed by some forbidden system, or perhaps it is covered by a formation... But now that we know these features, we should be able to get something out of it by asking around in the various sects.
不错，我也是这么想的。¤Nice, I was thinking the same thing.
看来你回忆中出现的那座古城废墟，就是传闻中每千年一启的宁州古迹了。¤It seems that the ruins of the ancient city that appear in your memories are the ancient monuments of Ning Province that are rumoured to be opened every thousand years.
老头儿，你对这天魔眼可有印象？¤Old man, do you have any impression of this demon eye?
若非是他们集体编造了这个谎言，便是当年另有什么连他们都不清楚的隐情，造成了这种误会。¤If they hadn't made up this lie collectively, there was something else going on back then that even they weren't aware of that caused this misunderstanding.
灭门之仇不可不报...魏老，我定会找出当年御剑门覆灭的真相。¤The revenge for the destruction of the clan must be avenged... Elder Wei, I will definitely find out the truth about the destruction of the Imperial Sword Sect back then.
但当年若非因为我执意要带回诛仙剑，又何至于被那古神教利用。¤But if it wasn't for my insistence on bringing back the Immortal Punishing Sword back then, why would I have been used by that Ancient God Cult?
其实已经过去这么多年，我早就已经放弃这个念想了。你若是和你师兄一样，能走到飞升这一步，便已是我魏无极此生最大的成就。¤In fact, so many years have passed that I have long since given up on this idea. If you are like your elder brother and can reach this stage of ascension, it will be my greatest achievement in this life.
轩儿能够走到这一步，我确实为他感到骄傲。¤I am indeed proud of Xuan'er for coming this far.
那时我并不知其为何物，只觉既以如此繁复的阵法封印之物必定不是凡品，便尝试以灵气激活此剑，试图破开那浓厚的煞气。¤At that time, I didn't know what it was. I just felt that since the thing sealed with such a complicated formation must not be an ordinary product, I tried to activate the sword with aura, trying to break the strong evil aura.
现在想来，若那煞气凶戾到足以令人心境混乱，或许当时我也受到了一定的影响。¤Now that I think about it, if that fierce aura was ferocious enough to confuse the mind, perhaps I was affected in some way at the time.
你若是和你师兄一样，能走到飞升这一步，便已是我魏无极此生最大的成就。¤If you, like your senior brother, make it this far to ascension, it will be the greatest achievement of my life, Wei Wuji.
那御剑门便是我千余年前创立的门派，其规模在当年也算是颇为风光。¤That Imperial Sword Sect is a school that I founded more than a thousand years ago, and its scale was quite beautiful back then.
不仅如此，你仔细看，这个大阵只有一个阵眼，却布置了八个阵脚。¤Not only that, but if you look closely, this big formation has only one formation eye, but eight formations are arranged.
哈哈哈，这你就不懂了。据说有些阵法最初便是远古修士观察妖兽天生带有的灵纹才领悟出来的，如果真有什么海兽领悟出了一套独特的布阵方式，也完全在情理之中嘛。¤Hahaha, you don't understand this. It is said that some formations were first comprehended by ancient cultivators by observing the spirit patterns inherent in monsters. If there are any sea beasts who have realized a unique formation method, it is completely reasonable.
……算了，在这胡乱猜测也于事无补，还是继续赶路吧。¤...Forget it, random guessing here won't help, so let's continue on our way.
你顺藤摸瓜在附近的海域搜寻了一番，果然在海底又发现了好几块摆放方式类似的黑岩。¤You followed the vines and searched the nearby waters, and sure enough, you found several black rocks that were placed in a similar way on the bottom of the sea.
若是一人操控，除非有极强的分神术，不然恐怕只有生出三头六臂才能操控这个阵法。¤If it is controlled by one person, unless there is a very strong distraction technique, I am afraid that only three heads and six arms can be used to control this formation.
若是上古手法岂会留到现在？这阵法看起来确实废弃了有些年头，但最多也不过千年罢了。我倒是觉得，这阵法不像是人类修士布下的...¤If it was an ancient method, how could it be left to the present? This formation seems to have been abandoned for some years, but it is only a thousand years at most. I feel that this formation is not like a human cultivator...
确实，我也研究过不少阵法，却从未见过这么奇怪的布阵方式...难道是什么上古遗留的特殊手法？¤Indeed, I have also studied a lot of formation methods, but I have never seen such a strange formation method... Could it be a special method left over from ancient times?
害，我对阵法什么的可是一窍不通，你说的这些到底意味着啥？¤Damn, I don't know anything about battle formations. What do you mean by this?
但若不是一人操控，通常也会设置多个阵眼，没必要只设置一个……¤But if it is not controlled by one person, there are usually multiple array eyes, there is no need to set only one...
奇怪，这些黑岩看上去不像天然形成的，倒像是有什么人用这些石头在海底布置阵法，真是闻所未闻...¤Strange, these black rocks don't look like they were formed naturally, but someone who uses these rocks to arrange formations on the seabed is unheard of...
不是人类...难不成还是海兽？¤Not a human... Could it be a sea beast?
海兽布下的？你怎么越说越瘆人了。¤Made by sea beasts? The more you talk, the more terrifying you are.
潮水退去，只见礁石滩上露出了几块摆放规律的黑岩石块。仔细看去，岩石上还铭刻着一些看不懂的图案与纹路。¤When the tide receded, I saw a few regularly placed black rock blocks exposed on the reef beach. Looking closely, there are some incomprehensible patterns and lines engraved on the rock.
不管怎么说，这阵法倒的确值得研究一番。我去把这些黑岩上铭刻的纹路都记下来，说不定会有一些新的感悟...¤In any case, this formation is indeed worth studying. I'm going to write down all the lines engraved on these black rocks, maybe there will be some new insights...
咳咳...老夫的意思是，这阵法恐怕不是人类修士布下的...¤Ahem... The old man means that this formation is probably not created by human cultivators...
这无尽之海上的海兽确实凶悍暴戾，但绝大部分即便修炼到元婴期，也没有什么灵智。要说有能力布下阵法的，无非也就是龙族或是吞云蟒这些天赋异禀，灵智极高的类型了。¤The sea beasts in this endless sea are indeed fierce and violent, but most of them have no spiritual wisdom even if they cultivate to the Nascent Soul stage. To say that those who are capable of laying out formations are nothing more than dragons or cloud swallowing pythons with extraordinary talents and extremely high intelligence.
由于动作太快，他也没有看清那是什么触手。只是猜测，那“幽厄”的本体可能是一只特殊的章鱼或者水母。¤Because the action is too fast, he did not see what tentacles. Just guess, that 'the' Yu Er 'body may be a special octopus or jellyfish.
正是在下，敢问前辈有何贵干？¤That's me. May I ask what you want?
原来如此...当下确有一事相求。¤I see... I really have a favor to ask.
总之，这“幽厄”极为强大，不然我们也不会拿出逆天造化术作为报酬了。¤In short, this 'Urgent' is extremely powerful, otherwise we would not have taken out the heavenly creation technique as payment.
若前辈还有什么想知道的，想必岛主会给出一个满意的答案。¤If there is anything else the senior wants to know, I'm sure the Islander will give a satisfactory answer.
这点小事便劳烦前辈出手，确实有损前辈威名。此事便由我等自行解决罢。¤It is indeed a disservice to your prestige to bother you with such a trivial matter. Let us settle this matter ourselves.
只见向之恒脸色微沉。¤I just saw Xiang Zhiheng's face slightly sunken.
在下{FirstName}{LastName}，为{color=#d0380a}逆天造化术{/color}而来，道友可愿指点一二？¤The first name is {FirstName}{LastName}, for {color=#d0380a}reverse heaven creation technique{/color} and come, you can guide a couple of?
好！前辈可是帮阴魂岛做成了一件大事！¤Yes! Senior has done a great job for the Island of the Underworld!
这“幽厄”神出鬼没，整个幽冥海都是它的狩猎范围。所以在此事发生后，愿意去幽冥海寻找神阴石的魂体也越来越少。¤This 'ghostly', the whole underworld sea is its hunting range. So after this happened, the soul body willing to go to the Underworld Sea to find the divine Yin stone is also less and less.
只见一众灵魂体神色复杂地望着你。¤Just see a group of soul bodies look at you with complicated expressions.
几百年前，{color=#d0380a}幽冥海{/color}上便开始有魂体陆续失踪。当时谁也不知道原因，只说是被“幽厄”抓跑了。¤Hundreds of years ago, {color=#d0380a} on the Sea of Ghosts {/color} then began to have the soul body one after another missing. The reason for this was unknown to anyone at the time, only that it was captured and run away by the 'Unearthly'.
本座为逆天造化术而来，这三冥海上出了什么乱子，需要本座出手？¤I have come for the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique, what has gone wrong on these Three Deep Seas that requires my intervention?
也罢，本来就不是寻常人能完成的任务，此番还是辛苦道友了。¤Also, it is not a task that can be done by ordinary people, this time it is still hard for you.
那在下便静候前辈佳音了。¤Then I will wait for your good news.
道友便是向之恒了？¤So you are Xiang Zhiheng?
你将那“幽厄”的妖丹亮了出来。¤You have shown the demon pellet of the 'evil'.
阴气旋不远处，一群灵魂体围着一个较为凝实的灵魂体，似乎在商议着什么事情。¤Not far from the yin spiral, a group of soul bodies gathered around a more solid soul body and seemed to be discussing something.
…道友有所不知，它神识极强，可谓是灵魂体的天敌，我们实在不愿招惹于它。¤...You do not know, it is extremely strong, can be said to be the natural enemy of the soul body, we really do not want to provoke in it.
若道友还有什么想知道的，想必岛主会给出一个满意的答案。¤If there is anything else you want to know, I think the island master will give a satisfactory answer.
前辈前去岛主处，即可领取逆天造化术。¤Seniors go to the Island Master to receive the Reverse Creation Technique.
阁下既然已经获取了逆天造化术，这五块神阴石便交予阁下，去岛主那换些东西罢。¤Since Your Excellency has already acquired the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique, these five Divine Yin Stones will be handed over to Your Excellency to exchange for something at the Island Master.
只见向之恒脸色闪过一丝不悦，随即又恢复了笑脸。¤Only a hint of displeasure flashed across Xiang Zhiheng's face, and then he returned to his smiling face.
多谢道友。若有机会，我定会前往{color=#d0380a}幽冥海{/color}一探究竟。¤Thank you very much, fellow daoist. If I have the opportunity, I will definitely go to the {color=#d0380a}Underworld Sea{/color} to find out what's going on.
关于这“幽厄”，可还有其他线索？¤About this 'ghost', can there be other clues?
阁下可有办成此事？¤Did you do this matter?
若前辈能够除掉这“幽厄”，便算是为我岛做了一件大事，逆天造化术自然也双手奉上。¤If you are able to get rid of this Urgent Evil, you will have done a great service to our island, and I will naturally give you the Heavenly Creation Technique.
此乃幽厄之妖丹。凭借此物，足以证明一切了吧？¤This is the demonic Pill of the darkness. With this object, it is enough to prove everything, right?
原来如此，在下确有一事相求。¤I see, I do have a favour to ask.
阁下只需将此事告知岛主李司魂，便可领取逆天造化术。¤You only need to inform the island master, Li Si Soul, about this, and then you can receive the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique.
此乃幽厄之妖丹。凭借此物，足以证明我完成了任务吧？¤This is the demonic Pill of the Phantom. With this object, it is enough to prove that I have completed the task, right?
前辈既然已经获取了逆天造化术，这五块神阴石便交予前辈，去岛主那换些东西罢。¤Since senior has already acquired the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique, these five Divine Yin Stones will be handed over to senior to exchange for something at the Island Master.
嗯，知道了。¤Well, got it.
若阁下能够除掉这“幽厄”，便算是为我岛做了一件大事，逆天造化术自然也双手奉上。¤If you can get rid of this 'evil', you will have done a great deed for our island, and I will naturally give you both hands of the Heavenly Creation Technique.
此事并非燃眉之急。阁下若没有足够的实力，切莫轻易前往，以免丢了性命。¤This matter is not an urgent matter. If you do not have enough strength, do not go easily, so as not to lose your life.
十几年前，有魂体目击了“幽厄”袭击的动作——从海底突然伸出一根触手，将低空飞行的一名魂体瞬间吸嗜殆尽。¤More than ten years ago, a soul witnessed the action of the 'Urgent' attack - from the bottom of the sea suddenly stretched out a tentacle, a low-flying soul instantly sucked up the thirst.
好！阁下可是帮阴魂岛做成了一件大事！¤Good! You've done a great job for the Island of Yin Souls!
不错，敢问阁下是？¤Not bad, dare I ask your Excellency?
请问，道友便是向之恒么？¤May I ask if you are Xiang Zhiheng?
不同于五行门派，玄道宗的山门只有一位金丹修士在此闭目修炼。你不想打搅他，便想绕至旁边而去。¤Unlike the Five Elements Sect, the Mystic Dao Sect's mountain gate has only one Golden Core cultivator practicing here with his eyes closed. You do not want to disturb him, so you want to go around to the side and go.
请问前辈来我玄道宗何事？¤What is the reason for your visit to the Mystic Dao Sect?
信物有么？¤Do you have the token?
你是...¤You are...
对，我奉{$BaiDi}之命，欲往天魔眼调查，特来玄道宗知会一声。¤Yes, I was ordered by {$BaiDi} to investigate to the eye of the heavenly demon, and I came to Mystic Dao Sect to let you know.
话说回来，{FirstName}{$DaoYou1}，你之前可是提到天魔眼？¤The first thing is, {FirstName}{$DaoYou1}, you mentioned the Heavenly Demon Eye before?
前辈当时还曾赠予我秘术气沉丹田，想来我能结成高品金丹而后修炼进步神速还多亏了前辈。¤At that time, senior also gave me the secret technique of Qi sinking into the Dantian, so I think it was thanks to senior that I was able to form a high grade Golden Core and make rapid progress in my cultivation.
何事？¤What's the matter?
可老祖最近不在宗门内，在下也不能擅作主张，可否请{$DaoYou1}等上一段时间？¤But the old ancestor has been away from the clan recently, so I can't take any liberties, can I please {$DaoYou1} wait for a while?
几百年不见，你还停留在金丹境...唉，修行不易，倒也正常。¤We haven't seen you for hundreds of years, and you're still stuck in the Golden Dan realm... Alas, it's not easy to cultivate, it's normal.
我当初在逸风城擂台取胜从而成为宁王府供奉，之后又在误打误撞之下遇到前辈，应要求监视魔教妖女。但追查过程中险些遭天魔道长老灭口，还是前辈从魔修手里救下我。¤I won the ring in the Windy City and became a Guest Elder of the Ning Palace, and then I met my predecessor by mistake, and was asked to monitor the demon girl of the Demon Cult. But in the process of tracking down the elders of the Heavenly Demon Path, I was nearly exterminated by the elders of the Heavenly Demon Path, but senior saved me from the evil cultivators.
{$DaoYou1}放心，在下领会得。¤{$DaoYou1}Don't worry, I'll get it.
前辈当时赠与的补灵丹对我修行之路大有裨益，一直想感谢前辈。¤The spirit tonic pills given to me at that time were very beneficial to my cultivation path, and I always wanted to thank them.
这倒没有，但既然让我来调查，想必{$BaiDi}不会事出无由。¤This is not true, but since I was asked to investigate, I think {$BaiDi} will not be without reason.
数百年前，我在逸风城擂台取胜从而成为宁王府供奉，之后又在误打误撞之下获知宁王勾结魔修，将供奉炼为丹药以延寿增修的真相，险些遭魔教长老灭口。当时还是前辈从魔修手里救下我。¤Hundreds of years ago, I won the tournament in Yi Feng City and became a Guest Elder of Ning King's residence. Afterwards, I learned by mistake that Ning King had colluded with a evil cultivator to refine the servant into a pill to prolong life and increase cultivation, and was nearly exterminated by a demon sect elder. At that time, it was the senior saved me from the hands of the evil cultivators.
进入核心区事关重大，历来是即便有信物也需向混元子老祖请示。¤Entering the core area is a matter of great importance, traditionally, even if there is a token also need to ask for permission from the mixed ancestors.
你一脸不快地从储物袋中掏出此前凌轩给你的信物递给他，后者显然是识货的，扫了两眼后又丢还于你。至于之前的嘲笑，却是闭口不谈。¤You look unhappy to pull out from the storage bag previously Ling Xuan gave you the token handed to him, the latter is obviously knowledgeable, swept two eyes and then threw back to you. As for the previous ridicule, is closed.
大殿正中，一位白袍修士正于此等候，料想便是所谓的葛师叔了。¤In the middle of the main hall, a white-robed cultivator is waiting here, I think it is the so-called Uncle Ge.
来玄道宗何事？¤What's the matter with coming to Mystic Dao Sect?
葛{$DaoYou},我奉{$BaiDi}之命，欲往天魔眼调查，还请行个方便。¤Ge {$DaoYou},I was ordered by {$BaiDi} to go to the Heavenly Demon Eye to investigate, please also make a convenience.
玄道宗大殿乍一看与五行门派也大差不差，并不会因为门人倨傲就装饰得更为奢华。¤Mystic Dao Sect hall at first glance and the five elements sect is also very different, and will not be decorated more luxurious because of the arrogance of the disciples.
你看眼前这人有些眼熟，可不正是当年宁王府遇见的那位身着白衣的前辈。¤This man looks familiar to you, but he is the senior dressed in white who met you at the Ning Wang Mansion back then.
唔...天魔眼么...¤Well... The Heavenly Demon Eye...
劳烦编身份也编一个像话一点的，哈哈哈。¤I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make up a decent identity, hahaha.
前辈当时赠与的法宝乌靴对我修行之路大有裨益，一直想感谢前辈。¤Seniors then gifted with the magic treasure Wu boots on my path of cultivation is very beneficial, has been trying to thank seniors.
{$DaoYou1}临行时，白帝可还有其他相关交代？¤When {$DaoYou1} was leaving, could the White Emperor have any other relevant explanation?
{size=24}信物倒是真的，不过我可不信白帝会有这么个金丹师弟。算了，跟我也没什么关系，就交给葛师叔分辨吧。{/size}¤{size=24}The token is true, but I do not believe that the White Emperor will have such a Golden Dan master brother. I don't think it's relevant to me, so I'll leave it to Uncle Ge to tell the difference. {/size}
不敢，在下不过元婴修士，怎当得起阁下口中的“前辈”二字。¤I don't dare, I'm just a YuanYing cultivator, how can I afford the word 'senior' in your mouth.
进入核心区事关重大，所以即便有信物历来也需向混元子老祖请示。¤Entering the core area is a matter of great importance, so even with a token historically, you need to ask for permission from the Elder Mixer.
你早就听闻玄道宗修士自恃门派强大，面对其他修士时有些盛气凌人，再加上有事在身于是没有太在意他的态度，只是退回山门前。¤You have long heard that the Mystic Dao Sect cultivator is proud of the powerful sect, facing other cultivators some overbearing, plus something in the body so did not care too much about his attitude, just retreat back to the front of the mountain gate.
几百年不见，如今你都是元婴境修士，与在下已无差距，真是后生可畏啊。¤A few hundred years have not seen, now you are a YuanYing realm cultivator, and I have no gap, really a newborn fearful ah.
你拿出此前凌轩交给你的信物递给他，后者也是在扫了一眼后丢换给你。¤You take out the token previously handed to you by Ling Xuan handed to him, the latter is also after a sweeping glance thrown in exchange for you.
前辈请进，葛师叔将会大殿等候前辈。¤Seniors please enter, Master Uncle Ge will be waiting for seniors in the main hall.
见你说得信誓旦旦，这白袍修士好像是想起来什么，但又不敢肯定。¤Seeing you speak with conviction, the white-robed cultivator seems to be thinking of something, but not sure.
可...老祖他最近不知在忙何事久不示人，{$DaoYou1}可否等上几月？¤But... Old ancestor he recently do not know what he is busy with long time not to show people, {$DaoYou1} can wait for a few months?
进去吧，葛师叔在大殿等你，有什么事跟他说。¤Go in, Uncle Ge is waiting for you in the main hall, talk to him if you have anything.
这...好像确有此事...¤This... It seems to be true...
{FirstName}{$DaoYou1}，您之前提到天魔眼？¤{FirstName}{$DaoYou1}, you mentioned the Heavenly Demon Eye before?
葛{$DaoYou},我奉{$BaiDi}之命...¤Ge {$DaoYou}, I am ordered by {$BaiDi} to...
你早就听闻玄道宗修士自恃门派强大，面对其他修士时有些盛气凌人，再加上有事在身于是没有太在意他的态度。¤You have long heard that the Mystic Dao Sect cultivator is confident that the sect is strong, when facing other cultivators some overbearing, plus something in the body so did not pay too much attention to his attitude.
老祖临行前曾特地吩咐，此行事关重要，若非紧要事件切勿打扰。而且每20年便会检视修复一次，天魔眼在玄道宗的看守及维护下，已是稳定了数千年，现下又无相关迹象表明天魔眼面临危机，只怕是不太方便联系...¤Before the old ancestor's departure, he had specifically instructed that this trip was important, so do not disturb if it is not an important event. And every 20 years will review the repair, the Heavenly Demon Eye in the Mystic Dao Sect under the guard and maintenance, is stable for thousands of years, and now there is no sign that the Heavenly Demon Eye is facing a crisis, it is not very convenient to contact ...
白帝楼有些事要与贵派的混元子长老商量。¤The White Emperor's House has some matters to discuss with the Elder of your school, the Hybrid Son.
你正欲拾级而上却被一奇形法宝挡住去路，回头再看时，这金丹修士还是坐于山门前，只是已经张开眼睛正看着你。¤You are going to pick up the level but was a strange-shaped magic treasure blocking the way, look back again, this jindan cultivator is still sitting in front of the door, but has opened his eyes are looking at you.
嘁，去吧，葛师叔在大殿等你，有什么事跟他说。¤Ch, go on, Uncle Ge is waiting for you in the main hall, what is the matter with him.
前辈，请问来玄道宗有何事？¤Senior, please ask what is the matter to Mystic Dao Sect?
道友当时赠与的补灵丹对我修行之路大有裨益，还要多谢葛道友。¤Daoist friend at that time gifted the spirit tonic pills are greatly beneficial to my path of cultivation, and I have to thank Daoist friend Ge.
是晚辈见识短浅了，前辈请进，葛师叔将会在大殿等候前辈。¤It's the junior's short-sightedness, senior please enter, Master Uncle Ge will be waiting for senior in the main hall.
你拿出此前凌轩交给你的信物，在他眼前晃了晃。¤You took out the token that Ling Xuan handed to you earlier and waved it in front of his eyes.
以现在的修为差距，这声前辈在下可不敢当，若是不嫌弃，称呼一声葛小友或葛道友便已是在下的荣幸了。¤If you don't mind, it would be an honor to address you as 'Ge Xiaoyou' or 'Ge Daoyou'.
这才数百年你竟已臻至吾辈修仙者所追求的化神境，而在下却还在元婴期聊无精进，真是后生可畏，后生可畏啊。¤This is only a few hundred years you have already reached my generation of immortal cultivators to pursue the realization of the Deity Transformation, while I am still in the Nascent Soul stage chatting about no improvement, really the latter is fearful, the latter is fearful ah.
我当初在逸风城擂台取胜从而成为宁王府供奉，之后又在误打误撞之下获知宁王勾结魔修将供奉炼为丹药以延寿增修的真相，险些遭天魔道长老灭口。当时还是前辈从魔修手里救下我。¤I won the ring in the Windy City and became a Guest Elder of Ning King's residence. Afterwards, I learned by mistake that Ning King had colluded with evil cultivators to refine the servant into a pill to prolong life and increase cultivation, and was nearly exterminated by the elders of the Heavenly Demon Path. At that time, it was senior saved me from the hands of the evil cultivators.
葛小友，我奉{$BaiDi}之命，欲往天魔眼调查，特来玄道宗知会一声。¤I am here to tell you that I was ordered by {$BaiDi} to go to the Heavenly Demon Eye to investigate.
事了之后前辈还曾赠予我秘术气沉丹田作为报酬，想来我当初能成功结丹还多亏了前辈。¤After the incident, senior also gave me the secret technique of qi sinking dantian as a reward, I think I was able to successfully form dan thanks to senior.
道友止步¤Stop, fellow Daoist!
你冷漠地点点头，而后便进入玄道宗山门。¤You nod indifferently, and then you enter the Mystic Dao Sect's mountain gate.
你有些不满，但还是拿出此前凌轩交给你的信物，在他眼前晃了晃。这玄道宗修士显然算是识货的，一转之前傲慢的态度，满脸堆笑。¤You are somewhat dissatisfied, but still take out the token previously handed to you by Ling Xuan and waved it in front of his eyes. This Mystic Dao Sect cultivator is obviously considered knowledgeable, a turn of the previous arrogant attitude, full of smiles.
在下想起来，离火门的炎萧炎道友前不久才进入过天魔眼核心区域，{$DaoYou1}不如先去询问一番炎道友，若有迹象表明天魔眼封印出了任何差池，在下斗胆作主陪{$DaoYou1}进天魔眼调查。可好？¤The first time I thought of it, Daoist Daoist Yan of the Heavenly Fire Gate had entered the core area of the Heavenly Demon Eye not long ago, {$DaoYou1} so why don't I go and ask Daoist Yan first, if there are any signs that the Heavenly Demon Eye seal has gone wrong, I would dare to accompany {$DaoYou1} into the Heavenly Demon Eye to investigate. How about that?
可老祖最近不在宗门内，我也不能擅作主张，可否请{$DaoYou1}等上一段时间？¤But the old ancestor is not in the clan lately, so I can't take any liberties, can I ask {$DaoYou1} to wait for a while?
道友当时赠与的法宝乌靴对我修行之路大有裨益，还要多谢葛道友。¤Daoist friend then gifted with the magic treasure Wu boots to my cultivation path is very beneficial, but also to thank Daoist friend Ge.
为何不用传音符联系？¤Why don't you use the voice transmission talisman to contact?
听你说完这人先是愣了一愣，但旋即便反应过来。¤Hearing you finish the man first froze, but then reacted.
前辈可还记得数百年前宁王府之事？¤Do you still remember the incident of Ning Wang House hundreds of years ago?
呵，我修炼数百年连白帝的师承都未曾听人提起，只怕几百年前早已飞升或是故去，怎会有你这金丹期的师弟？¤I have not even heard of the mastery of the White Emperor for hundreds of years, and I am afraid that he has long since ascended or passed away hundreds of years ago, so how could you have a Jindan-stage brother?
好像确有此事...¤It seems to be true...
你平淡地回应一声，同时迈步前往玄道宗大殿。¤You respond flatly, while taking a step to the Mystic Dao Sect's main hall.
前辈请前往大殿，葛师叔在那等候前辈，有什么事情请和他交流。¤Senior please go to the main hall, Master Uncle Ge is waiting for senior there, please communicate with him if you have any matters.
你是当初那个筑基修士...¤You are the original Foundation Establishment cultivator...
白帝的师弟？我可从未听闻白帝还有师弟。¤The White Emperor's senior brother? I have never heard that the White Emperor has a senior brother.
你正欲拾级而上却有人声从后方传来，转身看时，那金丹修士正恭敬地站在原地。¤You are about to pick up the steps but someone's voice came from the back, turned around to look, the jindan cultivator is respectfully standing in place.
你正欲拾级而上却被一奇形法宝挡住去路，回头再看时，这金丹修士还是闭目坐于山门前，连坐姿都未曾有变化，只是退回山门前。¤You are about to pick up the steps but was an odd-shaped magic treasure blocking the way, look back again, the jindan cultivator is still sitting in front of the mountain door with eyes closed, even sitting posture has not changed, just back to the front of the mountain door.
（是他？）¤(Is that him?)
各位道友，我们可是有什么误会？¤Friends, do we have a misunderstanding?
远处一阵阵剧烈的灵气波动，似是有什么阵法激活了。¤There was a violent aura fluctuation in the distance, as if some formation had been activated.
这么说来，最近本门失踪的师兄弟都是你们所为了？¤So, you are responsible for the recent disappearance of our brothers and sisters?
没误会，找的就是你们玄古门，丹药和血菩提都交出出来。我们可以考虑放你们一马。¤There is no misunderstanding, it is you, the Profound Ancient Sect, who are looking for, hand over both the Pill and the Blood Bodhi. We can consider letting you go.
没错，反正就让你做个明白鬼。¤That's right, let you be the one to understand anyway.
一行人被困于阵法之中，为首的元婴修士将宗门后辈护于身后。¤The group was trapped in the formation, with the YuanYing cultivator at the head of the group protecting the clan's descendants behind him.
正好我也想要试试我的新成果。¤It's just as well that I want to try out my new results.
又来只肥羊。¤Another fat lamb.
（我就先解决这布阵之人吧。）¤(I'll take care of the one who set up the formation first.)
你是离火门弟子，不若你问问炎萧吧。¤You are a disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate, if you ask Yan Xiao it.
你还有什么想问的吗？¤Do you have anything else you want to ask?
具体我也不太清楚，不过据说炎萧为其求情，倒是留下一条性命。¤I don't know the details, but it is said that Yan Xiao interceded for him, but left a life.
金丹长老？已经发现叛徒了？¤Elder Jin Dan? Traitors have been found?
前辈，走好。¤Senior, go well.
没想到此次，离火门有金丹长老叛变，倒是费了一些手脚，所幸我回来的及时，要不然是我的失职啊。¤Unexpectedly, this time, there was a rebellion by a Golden Core elder from the Heavenly Fire Gate, but it took some tricks. Fortunately, I came back in time, otherwise it was my negligence.
{xiaozi}，学艺不精啊，我才走开这两步险些出事。¤{xiaozi}, I'm not good at learning, I just walked away and almost had an accident in these two steps.
是的，其中一路人马漏出破绽，对方想跑，还好我们早有准备，已经拿下了。¤Yes, one of the people leaked flaws, and the other party wanted to run. Fortunately, we were prepared for it, and we have already won it.
此次你功不可没，这是结丹秘术《大周天吐纳》。¤This time you have contributed a lot. This is the secret technique of condensing alchemy Big Zhou Tian Tu Na.
受死吧！¤Success to death!
我先走了，这《大周天吐纳》，你细细参悟对结丹大有裨益啊。¤I'm leaving first. This Great Zhou Tian Tu Na, you can understand it, it will be of great benefit to the formation of alchemy.
道友，告辞。¤Friends, farewell.
又是古神教的家伙，“老熟人了啊”¤It's a fellow from the ancient gods, I'm an old acquaintance
没想到此次，离火门有金丹长老叛变，倒是费了一些手脚，所幸你这边没有出差错，要不然是我的失职啊。¤Unexpectedly, this time, there was a rebellion by a Golden Core elder from the Heavenly Fire Gate, but it took some hands and feet. Fortunately, you didn't make a mistake here, or it was my negligence.
对了，那火麟玉是离火门的奖励，你不用还了。¤By the way, the fire Spirit jade is the reward of the Heavenly Fire Gate, you do not need to return.
妖人尔敢？¤Dare the demon?
（三才剑？呼~终于到了）¤(Sancai sword? Huh~ finally here)
不错，已经独自斩杀了魔教妖人。¤Yes, I have already killed the demons alone.
一股螺旋而出的剑光，“唰”的穿胸而过。¤A spiral of sword light passed through the chest with a swish.
这广陵城有内外两道围墙，内墙有阵法加持，所以相对安全不少。¤This Guangling city has two walls inside and outside, and the inner wall is blessed by formations, so it is relatively safe.
这广陵城港口便是通往无尽之海，据说这海里的妖兽都有数万年修为，就连一般的金丹期修士也不敢随意招惹。¤The port of Guangling City leads to the endless sea. It is said that the monsters in this sea have been cultivated for tens of thousands of years, and even the ordinary Jindan stage cultivators dare not provoke them at will.
外墙就危险多了，听说每次来兽潮都会死不少人呢。¤The outer wall is much more dangerous. I heard that many people will die every time the animal wave comes.
不过，下一场就是决赛了要和“竹剑”温杰对上了，我竹山宗少有的剑修一脉的传人啊。¤However, the next game will be the final match against Bamboo Sword Wen Jie. He is a rare descendant of Jian Xiu in the Bamboo Mountain Sect.
{FirstName}{shixiong}三战连胜，不愧是大比魁首，这届魁首已经是囊中之物了。¤{FirstName}{shixiong} has won three games in a row. It is worthy of being the leader of the big competition. The leader of this year is already in the bag.
哈哈，什么承让你本就比我强，下一场你的对手是林怀蕊，小心了啊。¤Haha, what promise makes you stronger than me. Your opponent will be Lin Huairui in the next game. Be careful.
我本以为凭借着《五毒噬心决》，能一举夺魁，现在看来我还是不行啊。¤I thought I could win the first prize in one fell swoop with the 《 Five Poisons Heart Devouring Art 》, but now it seems that I still can't do it.
本届大比没什么名人参加，{FirstName}{shixiong}胜算更大。¤Compared with no celebrities to participate this year, {FirstName}{shixiong} has a better chance of winning.
{FirstName}{shixiong}竟能连战连胜。¤{FirstName}{shixiong} can win streak in a row.
对方点头致意后，祭出一柄飞剑，虽只是符器，但一股锐利的剑意扑面而来。¤After the other party nodded in greeting, he offered a flying sword. Although it was only a talisman, a sharp sword intent rushed toward his face.
{shidi}，请。¤{shidi}, please.
下一次比试，{FirstName}\r{LastName}对阵温杰！¤The next match, {FirstName}\r{LastName} will play against Wen Jie!
XXX对阵林怀蕊！¤XXX vs. Lin Huairui!
林师姐可是天灵根，精通术法我觉得本次大比魁首非她莫属。¤Senior Sister Lin have heavenly spiritual root, and I think she is better than the leader this time.
{FirstName}{shixiong}三战连胜，说不定可以争夺魁首之位。¤{FirstName}{shixiong} won three games in a row, maybe you can compete for the top spot.
多谢师兄承让。¤Thank you brother for accepting.
（最后一场了。）¤(The last one.)
（这小子对我胃口，若是能赢下那女娃娃，不妨收他入门下。）¤(This kid has an appetite for me. If you can win that girl doll, you might as well accept him as an entry.)
我会注意的¤I will pay attention
的确，本届大比没什么名人参加，{FirstName}{shixiong}胜算很大。¤Indeed, there are no celebrities participating in this competition, {FirstName}{shixiong} has a great chance of winning.
师兄，请指教。¤Brother, please advise.
咳咳咳...可惜，输在了这里...¤Cough cough cough...it's a pity, I lost here...
你第一次参与宗门大比，就打入了决赛，台下众人议论纷纷...¤The first time you participated in the Zongmen Competition, you made it to the finals, and everyone in the audience was talking...
连墨师兄都败了，此人恐怖如斯。林师姐和他相比也不知孰强孰弱。¤Even Senior Brother Mo was defeated. This person is terrifying. Senior Sister Lin doesn't know who is stronger or weaker than him.
请{FirstName}\r{LastName}上台对阵！¤Please {FirstName}\r{LastName} on stage to play against!
也不知这一战鹿死谁手。¤I don't know who will die in this battle.
倒也是。¤That's true.
我觉得温师兄更强，剑修之名可不是吹的。¤I think Brother Wen is stronger, and the name of Jian Xiu is not a boast.
一夜过去，在天机阁的专人治疗下，你的状态已经恢复如初。¤A night has passed, and with the special treatment from the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion, your state has returned as before.
{FirstName}{shidi}，请去台下稍作休息，稍后开始第二轮的比试。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, please go to the stage to rest for a while, and the second round of competition will start later.
你干净利落地赢下了第一轮比试的胜利。¤You won the first round cleanly.
没想到第一轮就败了...¤Unexpectedly, I lost the first round...
请{FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}上台！¤Please {FirstName}{LastName}{shidi} come on stage!
这么多功法……能给点建议吗？¤So many exercises...Can you give me some suggestions?
修习自己灵气亲和的功法，总能事半功倍。每种功法要修炼到深处都是耗时费力的，有时不如都学个大概，够用就好。¤Practicing one's own spiritual-friendly exercises can always get twice the result with half the effort. It takes time and effort to practice each exercise to the depths. Sometimes it is better to learn a general idea and just use it enough.
弟子在修炼本门功法还是有些许不解，不知授业长老可否解惑？¤I still have some confusion in the cultivation of my discipline's techniques, so I wonder if the Teaching Elder can clear up the confusion?
或是因为厚积薄发，短短数日她竟提升了一个小境界。¤Or because of the thickening of her heart, in just a few days she has raised a small realm.
你看到一名弟子盘膝而坐，似是进入了顿悟状态。你示意左右弟子不要打扰她，并为他护法。¤You see a disciple sitting cross-legged, seemingly in a state of epiphany. You signal the disciples to your left and right not to disturb her and to guard him.
等了一段时间，见人来的差不多了。你便开始讲法。¤After waiting for some time, you see that almost everyone has come. You then begin to speak the dharma.
看着他们你好像看到了曾经的自己，心神一荡遁入空明。¤When you look at them you feel like you see yourself once, and your mind is transported into the void.
之后，她盘腿坐下进入了顿悟的状态，¤After that, she sat down cross-legged and entered a state of epiphany.
我身为授业长老自是分内之事。¤I as the teaching elders since it is my part of the job.
台下弟子皆拱手拜谢。¤The disciples on the stage all bowed their hands in thanks.
有事吗？¤Can I help you?
多谢长老~¤Many thanks, Elder.
嗯，我作为授业长老也是分内之事。¤Well, it's also my part as an Instructor Elder.
你时而妙语生机口生莲花，时而掐指施法此方灵气因你而动。¤At times, you speak with a lotus flower in your mouth, at other times you cast a spell and the aura of this place moves because of you.
此女倒是有几分慧根。¤This woman has a few wise words.
嗯，无需挂心，我还有别的事先走了。¤Well, there's no need to worry, I've got other things to do and I've got to go.
好了，此次讲法就到这里吧，你们自己下去细细体悟。¤Well, that's it for this talk.
台下弟子或若有所思，或皱眉参悟。¤The disciples on the stage either pondered or frowned at their understanding.
{shixiong}要开始讲法么？¤Is {shixiong} going to start preaching?
呼~¤Phew~
你也盘膝坐下，一边修炼一边为其护法。¤You too sit down on your knees and guard him while you cultivate.
呼~多谢长老授业解惑之恩。¤Hoo~ Many thanks to the elders for their kindness in teaching and understanding.
她将自己几个修炼的问题向你提出，这些问题都被你一一解答。¤She put several of her cultivation questions to you, and these were answered by you.
哦？¤Oh?
你看到广场已经聚集了不少本门弟子，显然他们是来参加你讲法的。¤You see that a number of our disciples have gathered in the square, and it is clear that they have come to attend your sermon.
恭送长老。¤Greetings to the Elders.
她睁开双眼看了看左右，立刻明白是你为她护法。¤She opens her eyes to look around and immediately understands that it is you who are guarding her.
这个暗道极为隐秘，若没有金丹实力，入口处的机关绝无可能被发现。¤This hidden passage is extremely secretive and without the strength of a golden core cultivator, the entrance mechanism would never have been discovered.
果然有猫腻...¤It's really something...
这暗道并不算复杂，只有寥寥数条通道。你没有分散精力，沿着魔气最浓郁的方向探了过去。¤The dark passage is not too complicated, with only a handful of passages. Without distracting yourself, you probe along the direction where the demonic energy is thickest.
只见暗道尽头的房间内，布有一个晦涩诡异的阵法，由一名金丹魔修和数名筑基魔修共同维持。¤Only an obscure and bizarre formation was laid out in the room at the end of the dark passage, maintained by a Golden Dan evil cultivator and several Foundation Establishment evil cultivators.
“他不在洞府内？那他在哪？”¤He's not in the cave? Then where is he?
趁他们还未反应过来，你便出手除掉了最近的一名筑基魔修。¤Before they could react, you struck to get rid of the nearest Foundation Establishment evil cultivator.
果然，在一处相当隐秘的地方，你搜索到了一个通往地下的暗道。¤Sure enough, in a rather secluded area, you search for a secret passage leading underground.
一众筑基魔修也从暗道口冲了出来，将你团团围住，局势陷入了被动。¤A group of foundation-building evil cultivators also rushed out from the mouth of the dark tunnel, surrounded you, the situation was in a passive position.
就在此时，你突然察觉到背后一阵凉意。¤Just then, you suddenly notice a chill in your back.
而阵法的中间，赫然坐着一个表情极为痛苦的修士，阵法将他的灵气硬生生从体内抽出，炼化到一颗血色的丹药中。¤And in the middle of the formation sat a cultivator with an extremely painful expression as the formation drew his aura hard from his body and refined it into a blood-coloured Pill.
一道黑光攻来，你来不及闪躲，只是堪堪避开了要害，左肩还是被撕开了一道巨大的伤口。¤A black light attacks and you are too late to dodge, you just manage to avoid the vitals and still get a huge gash torn open on your left shoulder.
呵呵，反应倒是不错，不过你带着伤倒是如何同我们斗？¤Oh, that's a good response, but how are you going to fight us with your wounds?
这是...魔气？¤This is... Magic Qi?
在你隐藏气息之下，他们并没有发现你，这也得以让你取得先机。¤With you hiding your scent, they didn't spot you, and that allowed you to get a head start.
触动机关后，一股更为阴森诡异的气息扑面而来。¤When the mechanism was touched, a more sinister and eerie aura came over me.
这个洞府不大，看上去极为普通，但奇怪的是，“枯木老祖”却不在其中。¤The cave is small and looks extremely ordinary, but strangely enough, the Deadwood Ancestor is not in it.
你随即展开神识，搜索洞府的每一个角落，试图发现一些线索。¤You then unfold your soul sense and search every corner of the cave, trying to discover some clues.
{vpunch=10,0.5}这是！？？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}This is!??
你提起十二分戒备，将神识集中向暗道深处探去。¤You raise your guard and focus your divine awareness deeper into the dark tunnel.
竟然用活人炼化药物？¤How can you use a living person to refine a drug?
道友既然来了，何再不与在下过上两招？¤Since fellow Taoist is here, why don't you have two tricks with you?
阁下可敢试试，自己能接在下几招？¤Your Excellency, dare you to try, what can you do next?
传闻宁州古迹中存余着不少上古阵法，若能加以钻研定对我的阵法之道大有裨益。¤It is rumored that there are many ancient formations remaining in the ancient sites in Ning Province. If you can study and determine it, it will be of great benefit to my formation.
听闻宁州古迹内煞气四溢，若心智不坚定便会遭到煞气吞噬...¤I heard that the evil spirit is overflowing in the historic sites of Ning Province. If you are not firm, you will be swallowed by the evil spirit...
这无尽之海中的商机可是大得很，海中势力常有修士以物易物，也有些商队需要护送，他们会给完成任务的修士丰厚的报酬。¤The business opportunities in this endless sea are very big. The forces in the sea often have cultivators bartering things, and some caravans need to be escorted. They will give cultivators rich rewards for completing tasks.
书架上整齐的放置的玉简，很明显是此间主人留给你的¤The jade slips neatly placed on the bookshelf were obviously left to you by the owner of this room
若是想要淬体必须找到九霄雷狱的空间节点了。¤If you want to quench your body you must now find the spatial node of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison.
这位前辈倒是无私，自己这数百年的研究就这么分享给后人了。¤This predecessor was selfless, sharing his centuries of research with future generations.
在雷鸣海上击败{color=#d0380a}雷灵{/color}吸收了雷晶之后，本座发现可以和源自九霄雷狱的先天灵气产生某种联系，进而吸收灵气用以锻体。¤After defeating the {color=#d0380a}Thunder Spirit{/color} on the Thunder Sea and absorbing the Thunder Crystal, I found that I could create some kind of connection with the innate spiritual energy originating from the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, and thus absorb the spiritual energy to forge my body.
九霄雷狱乃是一天地异象，存在于一方小世界之中，常人难以察觉，但若是常年奔波于海上未尝不可以捕捉到这一空间节点进入其中。¤The Nine Heavens Thunder Prison is a heaven and earth phenomenon that exists in a small world and is difficult for ordinary people to perceive, but if one travels the seas all year round, it is not impossible to capture this spatial node and enter it.
这上面记载一种在九霄雷狱中锻体的功法，可以在九霄雷狱中承受天雷吸收先天之气，直到达承受极限完成锻体。¤This is a technique for forging a body in the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, which allows you to absorb the innate Qi from the heavenly thunder in the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, until you reach the limit of tolerance and complete the forging.
根据我的推断，九霄雷狱中的先天灵气极难吸收，但若是体道大成者进入还是有所裨益。¤According to my deduction, the innate spiritual energy in the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison is extremely difficult to absorb, but it is still beneficial if those who have achieved great success in the physical path enter.
本座“焚天炎帝”，在此片海域发现异火，这异火诞生于天地异象九霄雷狱之中，故而命名九天劫火。¤I, the ''Emperor of Burning Heaven'', found a strange fire in this sea, which was born in the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, hence the name Nine Heavens Tribulation Fire.
这海上常有一些坊市岛兜售稀奇古怪的玩意儿，好多都是咱们宁州大陆没见过的！¤There are often some strange things on the sea in the market and islands, and many of them are not seen in the mainland of Ning Province!
古色古香的红木大床被烟粉色的帷幔遮挡着，随着你的靠近，薄布后深色的轮廓若隐若现，看来似乎有什么东西隐藏在帐子里。¤The antique mahogany bed is hidden by the smoky pink curtain. As you approach, the dark outline behind the thin cloth is looming. It seems that something is hidden in the tent.
桌子上落满了灰尘，你在铜镜的旁边发现了一根断裂的玉簪，从材料看来原本应当是护身法宝一类的东西。¤The table was covered with dust, and you found a broken hosta beside the bronze mirror. From the material point of view, it should have been something like a magic weapon for body protection.
你猝不及防，被吓了一跳，下意识地将手上的灵气送了出去。那尸体吃了一击，咔啦啦地散成几块，露出身后掩藏的什么东西来。¤You were caught off guard, you were taken aback, and subconsciously sent the aura out of your hand. The corpse took a blow and broke into several pieces, revealing something hidden behind you.
直觉告诉你，床帐后的东西并不简单。为了安全着想，你并没有继续靠近。¤Intuition tells you that what is behind the bed net is not simple. For the sake of safety, you did not continue to approach.
即使历经时间洗礼，这把剑依旧纤尘不染，精美的剑鞘似乎彰显着它的不凡。你将剑握入掌中，澎湃的水系灵气顿时似江入海般奔涌而来，剑穗上天青色宝珠也应和般地亮了起来。¤Even after the baptism of time, this sword is still slender and dusty, and the exquisite scabbard seems to show its extraordinary. You hold the sword in your palm, and the surging water system aura suddenly rushes like a river into the sea, and the sword spikes on the sky blue pearl. It should also light up peacefully.
屋内已经没什么值得调查的东西了，你沿着屋内的台阶向上走去。幸好此处的空间还算稳定，你重新回到了古原城内。¤There is nothing worth investigating in the house. You walk up the steps in the house. Fortunately, the space here is fairly stable. You are back in the ancient city.
你的动作虽然轻柔，但饱经时间摧折的布料早已脆弱不堪。你的手刚刚放上去，便听见唰啦一声，轻薄的床幔被扯成两段，飘散的灰尘充斥了整张红木床，你只得用灵气将浮尘统统除去。¤Although your movements are gentle, the fabric that has been torn down by time has long been fragile. Just put your hand on it, you heard a scream, the thin bed curtain was torn into two, and the floating dust filled the entire mahogany bed. , You have to use aura to remove all the dust.
这就是星河剑派遗失的仙剑吗...？¤Is this the lost fairy sword of the Galaxy Sword Sect...?
你心性宽厚，波澜不惊，外物的刺激并不能左右你的心情。这具尸体虽然出现突然，但你并没有受到什么影响。¤You are generous and calm, and the stimulation of foreign objects can't affect your mood. Although this corpse appeared suddenly, you were not affected in any way.
或许是空间错乱的缘故，你和倪旭欣并未传送到一处。而你落脚的这处空间似乎处于地底，室内的摆设不曾受到战争的波及，只是积了厚厚的灰尘。¤Perhaps because of the space disorder, you and Ni XuXin did not teleport to the same place. The space where you settled seems to be underground. The furnishings in the room have not been affected by the war, but thick dust has accumulated.
毕竟是上古城池，这间房屋里或许还残存着一些珍贵的功法宝物，你打算简单地搜查一番。¤After all, it is the ancient city. There may still be some precious exercises treasures remaining in this house. You plan to search it briefly.
难不成这间屋主也是修士吗...？¤Is it possible that the owner of this house is also a cultivator...?
失去了床帐的遮掩，塌上的黑影显露在你面前，一具身着星河道袍、早已失去生气的尸体面色惨然，直勾勾地盯着你所在的方向！¤Lost the cover of the bed net, the fallen black shadow is revealed in front of you, a corpse dressed in galaxy robes, long lost in life, looks miserable, staring in the direction where you are!
你翻箱倒柜，最终在最底层的木箱里发现了一件勉强能看出原本形状的道袍，显然是不能再穿了。¤You rummaged through the cabinets, and finally found in the bottom wooden box a robe that could barely be seen in its original shape. Obviously, you can't wear it anymore.
你低头看去，以古文刻画的“辰星”二字泛着萤萤微光。¤You look down, the word Chen Xing in ancient Chinese is glowing with fluorescent light.
床幔近在咫尺，你...¤The bed curtain is close at hand, you...
此时微弱的灵力波动传来，你看向尸体的后方，一柄闪烁着浅淡灵光的剑落入视野。¤At this moment, a faint fluctuation of spiritual power came. You look behind the corpse, and a sword with a faint aura falls into your field of vision.
见你并未出声他继续说道。¤Seeing that you did not make a sound he continued.
也不知道多少豹麟兽惨遭毒手。¤There is no telling how many leopard-lin beasts have been killed.
定眼看去台上坐着一个玄古门修士，正在此地维持着阵法的运转。¤When you look at the stage, there is a Profound Ancient Sect cultivator sitting here, maintaining the formation.
我玄古门这手段也算不上什么吧。¤This tactic of my Profound Ancient Clan is nothing, right?
我本不愿和你为敌，但受人所制，你不能再往前了。¤I would not have made an enemy of you, but you cannot go further because you are constrained by others.
道友，我辈修仙之人本就是逆天而行，讲究夺万物之灵以强己身。¤Fellow Daoist, we cultivators of immortality originally walk against the heavens and seek to take the spirit of all things to strengthen ourselves.
眼前是一团暗金色的血液浮于半空之中，显然刚刚那滴血液就是汇入了此处。¤In front of him was a cloud of dark golden blood floating in mid-air, and it was clear that the drop of blood had just converged here.
只是可惜，这些豹麟兽即使以秘法催动境界最高者也不过是金丹，效果差强人意。¤It's just a pity that even if these Leopard-Lin beasts are activated by secret techniques, the highest realm is only Jindan, so the effect is not as good as it could be.
哈哈哈，那是自然。¤Hahaha, that's natural.
这宁州古迹凶险异常，{$TmpTalkString}此番若是前去可要千万小心。¤This Ning Province monument is extremely dangerous, {$TmpTalkString} so be careful if you go there this time.
哦？竟然是化尘教的{FirstName}长老？{FirstName}长老道法高深，我也早有耳闻。¤Oh? It turned out to be the {FirstName} elder of the Huachen Cult? {FirstName} elders have advanced methods, and I have heard about them.
哦？竟然是竹山宗的{FirstName}长老？{FirstName}长老道法高深，我也早有耳闻。¤Oh? Could it be Elder {FirstName}of the Bamboo Mountain Sect? Elder {FirstName} is wise and power, your fame preceeds you.
宁州古迹中奇珍异宝无数，火灵气充沛的灵宝定也不下少数。¤There are countless rare treasures in Ning Province's historic sites, and there are certainly not a few Lingbao that are full of fire and energy.
哦？竟然是{FirstName}道友？{FirstName}道友道法高深，我也早有耳闻。¤Oh? It's fellow {FirstName} Daoist? I have heard of {FirstName}Daoist friends' advanced techniques and experience.
这宁州古迹凶险异常，道友此番若是前去可要千万小心。¤This historic site in Ning Province is extremely dangerous and dangerous. Fellow Taoists should be very careful if they go there.
原来是苍坤长老。许久未见，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤So it is Elder Cang Kun. I haven't seen you for a long time, so if we meet in the monuments this time, please take care of us.
原来是离火门的苍坤长老，久仰大名，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤Ah, it is Venerable Pale Earth from the Heavenly Fire Gate. Your fame preceeds you. If we are to meet within the ruins, let us watch each other's backs.
若是那位得此助力，说不定便可...唉，不知于宗门是福还是祸啊......¤If that person has this help, maybe it will be... alas, I don't know if Yu Zongmen is a blessing or a curse...
哦？竟然是星河剑派的{FirstName}长老？{FirstName}长老道法高深，我也早有耳闻。¤Oh? It turned out to be the {FirstName} elder of the Galaxy Sword Sect? {FirstName} elders have advanced methods, and I have already heard about it.
特别是像赤火元铜精这样的六品火属性珍宝，{$TmpTalkString}若是有幸寻得，不知可否转让与我们离火门。我们愿意出高价收购！¤Especially a sixth-grade fire-attribute treasure like the Red Flame Yuancui Essence, {$TmpTalkString} if you are lucky enough to find it, I wonder if you can transfer it to our Heavenly Fire Gate. We are willing to pay a high price for it!
哦？竟然是金虹剑派的{FirstName}长老？{FirstName}长老道法高深，我也早有耳闻。¤Oh? It turned out to be the {FirstName} elder of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect? {FirstName} elders have advanced methods, and I have already heard about it.
此番前往宁州古迹，我们离火门还有一要事，那便是收集一些在宁州较为少见的火属性矿石材料。¤This time we are going to the historic sites in Ning Province. We have one more important thing to do with Heavenly Fire Gate. That is to collect some rare fire-attribute mineral materials in Ning Province.
此地兽王已除，可以回去复命了。¤The Beastmaster here has been removed, and you can go back and return to life.
这妖兽好生厉害。¤This monster is so powerful.
他瘫跪在地上，双手浅浅插入泥土之中，你能感受到他仅有的生机在迅速流逝。¤He is paralysed on his knees, his hands shallowly thrust into the earth, and you can feel what little life he has left draining away rapidly.
我不想死，我不会死……¤I don't want to die, I won't die ......
…罢了，还是先回枯木林看看他们留下了什么线索吧。¤...It's just a matter of going back to Deadwood to see what clues they've left behind.
你没想到，他竟以这种方式“终结”了自己的生命。¤You didn't expect him to end his life in this way.
……什么？¤...... what?
说吧，你与魔门到底有何瓜葛？¤Tell me, what exactly is your involvement with the Devil's Gate?
…竟然？¤...surprisingly?
呵呵，原来如此……¤Oh, so that's it ......
只见他十指生根，身上冒出嫩芽，赫然变成了一个木人，融入到这茂密的森林中。¤He saw his ten fingers grow roots and shoots sprout from his body, and he was transformed into a wooden man, merging into this dense forest.
嗯？我天机阁情报从未有误，其中可是有了误会？¤Yes? There has never been a mistake in my information, is there a misunderstanding?
只见一道人影从内阁飞出，与来者遥遥对峙。¤A figure was seen flying out of the inner pavilion, confronting the visitor from a distance.
呵呵，这还是这麒麟本就无甚恶意，要不然化神修士的威压岂是你{xiaozi}能够抵抗的？¤The actual fact is that this Qilin is not malicious, otherwise the pressure of a Deity Transformation cultivator would not be something you {xiaozi} could resist.
阁主他自有要事在身，前辈若是有什么需要尽管提，我天机阁自然全力以赴。¤If there is anything you need, please do not hesitate to mention it and we will do our best.
远处一团火焰飞速接近中，恐怖的热浪甚至激活了天机阁的护城大阵。¤In the distance, a ball of flames approached at speed, and the terrifying heat wave even activated the Heavens Secrets Pavilion's Great City Protection Formation.
哼，还好意思说那凤凰遗迹？¤Hmph, how dare you talk about that phoenix relic?
钟道友许久不见别来无恙啊？¤Long time no see, Daoist Zhong, how are you?
退下，不得无礼。¤Stand down and do not be rude.
道友请~¤Friends, please~
道友言重了，这天下又有谁敢呢？我天机阁卖的就是情报，这凤凰墓的开启信物可没有诓骗道友啊。¤Who in the world would dare to do that? What I sell is information, and this token for the opening of the Phoenix Tomb has not swindled you.
没什么好羡慕，脚踏实地一步步来，你未必没有那蜕凡化神誉满九州之日。¤There is nothing to envy, but if you take one step at a time, you may not have the day to reach Deity Transformation and your fame will spread to the Nine Provinces.
凤凰遗迹倒是不假，但是那凤凰血早就消散了。范杰，你莫不是消遣我？¤The phoenix relics are true, but that phoenix blood has long since dissipated. Fan Jie, are you not amusing me?
不过我阁中还有一件宝物或许可以替代这凤凰血，道友移步？¤However, there is another treasure in my pavilion that may be able to replace this phoenix blood, will you move?
不知是哪位前辈当前，来我天机阁有何贵干？¤I don't know which senior is current, what is the purpose of coming to my Heavens Secrets Pavilion?
范杰，你给本座出来！！¤Fan Jie, come out to me!!!
怎么火气这么重，可是受了那凤凰血的影响？¤Why is the fire so strong? Is it influenced by the phoenix blood?
说罢两人并做一道遁光直入内阁。¤After saying this, the two of them made a disappearing light and went straight into the inner pavilion.
哼，也不早说。¤Hm, didn't say so earlier either.
呼~好恐怖的威压。¤Phew~ What a terrifying pressure.
见过前辈¤Well met seniors
这修炼的功法以天阶为首，地阶次之，人阶则最为普通。相对的，越强大的功法也越难领悟，想要突破到高层更是需要上百年的苦修努力。所以从人阶功法开始打好基础，非常重要。¤Cultivation techniques are divided by tiers Heavenly Ranks are first, Earth Rank is second, and the Human Ranks are the most common. On the other hand, the stronger a technique, the harder it is to comprehend. It takes hundreds of years of hard work to break through to the higher levels. Therefore, it is very important to lay a good foundation from the Human Rank techniques first.
门派入门功法为《化尘诀》，此乃我教弟子必须修习的基础功法。尘，扬土也。化尘之窍在于沉可中正稳健，扬则灵动敏迅。{shidi}可配合我教入门神通《还尘》与《化沙》，仔细体悟其中法门。¤The introductory practice of the sect is The Art of Dissolving Dust, which is the basic practice that my disciples must practice. Dust and dust.

书海无涯，学无止境。¤The sea of ​​books is endless, and learning is endless.
{shidi}初来乍到，作为师兄我便私下赠与你一些砂晶，你可小心切莫被长老知晓。¤{shidi} just arrived, as a senior, I will give you some sand crystals privately, you can be careful not to be known by the elders.
这几种功法类型各有优劣，你也可以同时兼修多个不同的功法，但我建议你把修炼速度最快的功法，作为你的{color=#d0380a}主修功法{/color}。¤These types of exercises have their own advantages and disadvantages. You can also practice multiple different exercises at the same time, but I suggest that you use the fastest exercise method as your {color=#d0380a} main practice. Method{/color}.
{shixiong}，今日来藏经阁有什么事么？{w}{w=0.5}¤{shixiong}, what's the matter in the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion today? {w}{w=0.5}
听说天魔眼越往中心深入，出现的魔物就越强。¤I heard that the deeper the eye of the demon goes to the center, the stronger the monster will appear.
...嗯，就是这本了...{shidi}之前对修炼的功法可有了解？¤...Well, it's this book...Does {shidi} have any knowledge of cultivation techniques before?
{shidi}，可有什么疑问？¤{shidi}, any questions?
多谢师兄指点。¤Thank you brother for your advice.
{shidi}若还想兼修本门的其它功法，可以来藏经阁借阅。¤{shidi}If you still want to practice other exercises in this school, you can come to the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion to borrow them.
哈哈，宗门内的资源可不能用灵石换取，只有对宗门做出贡献的弟子才有资格在藏经阁与神兵阁兑换功法及法器，而这砂晶正是弟子们贡献度的体现。¤Haha, the resources in the sect cannot be exchanged for spirit stones. Only the disciples who have contributed to the sect are eligible to exchange exercises and artifacts in the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion and the Shenbing Pavilion, and this sand crystal is the disciple. The embodiment of contribution.
一般同阶的功法可以分为几种类型，战斗类的功法可以在与人斗法时提供更强的帮助，修炼类的功法则在修炼速度上有很大的优势，而中庸型的功法则二者兼顾。¤Generally, Techniques of the same rank can be divided into several types. Combat-type skills are required when fighting against people. Cultivation-type Techniques a great improves ones speed when cultivating. Finally there are techniques that seeks a balance for both.
往年都只有宗门最厉害的几位师兄师姐，才敢到天魔眼的{color=#d0380a}中心区域{/color}猎魔。¤In previous years, only the most powerful brothers and sisters of the sect, dare to go to the {color=#d0380a}central area{/color} of the eyes of the demon hunting.
宗门广场上的{color=#d0380a}告示{/color}栏每隔一段时间会发放宗门任务，{shidi}完成任务后便可获得砂晶。¤The {color=#d0380a}notice{/color}board in the sect square gives out sect commissions at regular intervals, {shidi} will obtain sand crystals upon completion of the quests.
哟，是新来的小{shidi}。你等着，我去将本门入门功法拿给你。¤Oh, it's the newcomer {shidi}. You wait, I will show you this introductory exercise.
若真是如此，那像他这样的人可能不止这一个。接下来要多加小心了。¤If this is the case, there may be more than one person like him. Be careful next.
这也只是我的猜测罢了，毕竟每隔千年，便会有来自各地的修士进入宁州古迹寻找机缘。¤It's just my guess. After all, every thousand years, cultivators from all over the country will enter the ruins of Ning Province to find opportunities.
不错，你这么一说，我刚刚的确也有一些烦躁的感觉。只是并不明显，因此没有太过在意。¤Yes, you said that. I did have some irritability just now. It's just not obvious, so I didn't care too much.
这里原本就是古战场，乃大凶之地，因此煞气很重。我猜测，若是在这片空间待的时间太久，便会逐渐变得残暴易怒，直到失去意识，成为和此人一样的杀戮机器。¤This place was originally an ancient battlefield, and it was a place of great evil, so the evil spirit is very heavy. I guess that if you stay in this space for too long, you will gradually become cruel and irritable, until you lose consciousness and become like this person. Killing machine.
短时间内自然没有什么问题，而且心境越是坚定，对这种煞气的抵御能力就会越强。¤Naturally there is no problem in a short period of time, and the more determined the mood, the stronger the ability to resist this evil spirit.
这到底是什么人，出手看起来毫无章法可言，用来用去也只会一两个招式，威力倒是不凡。¤Who the hell is this? The shots seem to have no rules at all, and they can only be used for one or two moves. The power is extraordinary.
你注意到没有，从我们进入这片位面以来，便不由自主的会产生一些急躁和焦虑感。¤Have you noticed that since we entered this plane, we have involuntarily produced some sense of irritability and anxiety.
好险...¤so close...
你是说，这人可能已经在这片位面被困了上百年，才变成的如今的样子？¤You mean, this person may have been trapped in this plane for hundreds of years before becoming what he is now?
此人或许便是千年前进入古迹寻宝的一员，只是不知因何原因没能及时离开，被困在了这里，最后成了这幅人不人鬼不鬼的样子。¤This person may be one of the people who entered the treasure hunt thousands of years ago, but failed to leave in time for some reason, and was trapped here, and finally became this man and ghost.
不过若是时间一长，在这里待上十年甚至百年，那就不一样了。¤But if it takes a long time and stays here for ten or even a hundred years, it will be different.
哈哈，送上门的肉参。¤Haha, meat ginseng delivered to the door.
我一个外人，还是不要乱转为好。¤I'm an outsider, it's better not to turn into chaos.
我先回去汇报此事。¤I'll go back and report this first.
此事事关重大，你出去之后不要声张。¤This matter is very important, so don't say anything after you go out.
你还愣着干嘛？¤What are you doing in a daze?
对方深吸一口气，神色凝重的面向你¤The other party took a deep breath and faced you with a solemn expression
这是千年灵剑晶是难得一见的炼器材料，你且收好他日炼制飞剑加入其中必能使之威能大增。¤This is the Millennium Spirit Sword Crystal, which is a rare material for refining. If you collect it and add it to refine the flying sword in the future, it will greatly increase its power.
嗯，我也看到了，这东西不简单啊。¤Well, I have seen it too, this thing is not simple.
你灵光一现，收益匪浅。¤You have a glimpse, and you have made a lot of money.
剑阵的那一丝诡异的滞涩感消失不见。¤The strange lingering feeling of the sword formation disappeared.
你出去之后切记不要与他人透露今日所见。¤After you go out, remember not to reveal to others what you saw today.
不错，这是任务奖励，我这就是送你出去。¤Yes, this is a quest reward, I am here to send you out.
你眼前是一柄青龙灵纹的仙剑。¤In front of you is a fairy sword with a blue dragon spirit pattern.
握在手心，诡异的血气消失不见，细细看来这就是一块成色不错的灵剑晶。¤Hold it in the palm of your hand, the strange blood disappeared, and it looks like this is a good-quality spirit sword crystal.
只见手他掐剑诀，一道剑光注入晶石，那诡异的血气又四溢开来。¤Just see the hand he pinched the sword trick, a sword light into the crystal, the bizarre blood gas again spilled out in all directions.
只见他一起捏法诀，环绕的剑气露出一豁口，你纵身一跃进入核心。¤I saw him squeeze the tactics together, the surrounding sword aura revealed a gap, and you jumped into the core.
楼内会给你丰富奖励的，我们先出去吧。¤There will be rich rewards in the building, let's go out first.
对方听罢，一把夺过晶石，眉头紧锁的细细端详起来。¤The other party listened, grabbed the spar, and looked carefully at it with frowning.
在布阵的灵剑晶之中，你发现一块散发着一丝诡异血气的晶石，就是它阻碍了阵法的流转。¤Among the spirit sword crystals that were set up, you found a crystal that emitted a strange blood aura, and it was the one that blocked the flow of the formation.
我来开启禁制，切记不要乱动。¤I'm here to open the ban, remember not to move.
你把刚刚所见一一道来。¤Take what you just saw one by one.
（白痴...）¤(moron...)
我还有要事，先走了¤I have something to do, let's go first
千年灵剑晶？{xiaozi}私自盗取布阵材料可不好啊!¤Millennium Spirit Sword Crystal? {xiaozi} stealing array materials privately is not good!
两仪相生！¤The two are born together!
老头？你刚刚看到了吗？¤Old man? Did you just see it?
你对对剑阵的熟悉，让你有所加成。¤Your familiarity with the sword formation gives you a bonus.
你轻松连斩两名祭血使，受到了血剑宫元婴修士的注意。¤You easily killed two blood sacrificial messengers, and received the attention of the Blood Sword Palace YuanYing cultivators.
哼，看剑！¤Huh, look at the sword!
道友可是正打算出海？如果灵石充裕最好还是选择品阶高些的灵舟，金丹期修为在这海上实在算不得什么倚仗。¤Friends of Daoist are planning to go to sea? If the spirit stone is abundant, it is better to choose a higher-grade spirit boat. The Golden Core Stage cultivation base is really not a reliance on this sea.
上古龙宫，对你们如此重要，应该不仅仅只是祖地吧。¤The Ancient Dragon Palace, so important to you, should not only be the ancestral land.
敖灵转向你。¤Ao Ling turned to you.
敖灵道友，幸不辱命。¤Ao Ling Daoist friend, fortunately not insulted.
道友，我就先助我兄长疗伤。¤Fellow Daoist, I will help my brother heal first.
请讲。¤Speaking.
不辛苦，这都是灵儿应该的。¤No hard work, it's all Spirit's due.
道友还请留步，敖玄还有一事相求。¤Fellow Daoist please stay, Ao Xuan has one more thing to ask for.
道友，此时还需你多多费心，探明东海龙宫，我族必然不会亏待与你。¤Fellow Daoist, at this time, you still need to pay more attention to find out the Dragon Palace of the East China Sea, and my clan will definitely not treat you badly.
上古一战我龙族元气大伤，秘宝、秘法大量遗失，所以寻回上古龙宫对我族至关重要。¤In the first battle of the ancient times, my dragon clan's vitality was severely damaged, and a large number of secret treasures and secret methods were lost, so it is very important for our clan to find the Ancient Dragon Palace.
灵儿，我被困的这段时间，辛苦你了。¤Ling'er, I've worked hard for you during the time I was trapped.
你正欲转身离开，突闻身后敖玄叫住了你。¤You were about to turn around and leave when Ao Xuan called out to you suddenly.
灵儿，我回来了。¤Ling'er, I'm back.
我自当鼎力相助。¤I will do my best to help.
目前，东海探索陨龙之地是因龙脉之力上涌而被推至海上，以此推测当年沉没的龙宫有可能现世。¤At present, the land of the East China Sea to explore the falling dragon was pushed to the sea due to the surge of the power of the dragon veins, so it is speculated that the dragon palace that sank in that year may come to life.
这枚天道果还请道友收好。¤This heavenly Dao fruit also please accept the Dao friend.
敖灵看着你们脸上难掩激动的神色。¤Ao Ling looked at your face can not hide the look of excitement.
兄长，我就知道你没事的。¤Brother, I knew you'd be fine.
听你说完，冲虚也是一滞，尔后张了张口却只是吐出一口鲜血，没蹦出半个字。¤After listening to you, Chongxu was also stagnant, and then he opened his mouth but only spit out a mouthful of blood, without a word.
王登伏在地上一脸恶毒的抬头看向你。¤Wang Deng crouched on the ground and looked up at you with a vicious face.
当年你徒儿要当众格杀我这晚辈时，没见你加以阻拦。今日我击败他，却又在此饶舌。¤When your disciple wanted to kill my junior in public, I didn't see you stop it. Today I beat him, but I'm raping here.
两次可都是你们星宫的人先动手，怪罪到我头上可太冤枉了，只是没想到你们实力如此不济还喜欢出手，怪哉怪哉。¤Both times, the people from your star palace took the initiative first. It's too unfair to blame me. I just didn't expect you to be so weak and still like to shoot. It's strange.
不然下次再让我碰到你，嘿嘿。¤Otherwise, let me meet you next time, hehe.
当年害星宫丢尽颜面的是谁，你心里没数么？居然还厚颜无耻的怪罪到我头上！¤Who was the one who harmed the Xinggong to lose face in those days, do you have no idea? It's even brazen to blame me!
几息之后，又有一位男修急冲冲的御空飞到冲虚散人身旁，确认他只是受了轻伤，而性命无碍，才放下心来。¤After a few breaths, another male cultivator rushed to Yukong to fly beside the Chongxu Sanren, confirming that he was only slightly injured and his life was safe, so he was relieved.
小友境界虽有不足，实力却很不错，但在我星宫出手，甚至打伤两位长老，想必目的不会是祝贺这么简单吧？¤Although the realm of the little friend is insufficient, the strength is very good, but in my star palace, and even wounding the two elders, the purpose must not be as simple as congratulations, right?
至于王登，更是在战斗的余波中早已重伤不醒，像堆垃圾般堆在地上。¤As for Wang Deng, he was seriously injured in the aftermath of the battle, and was piled on the ground like a pile of garbage.
咳咳，敢来我星宫闹事，可...咳...可别想就这么一走了之！¤Ahem, dare to come to my star palace to make trouble, but...cough...don't even think about it and just leave!
守门弟子哪见过这场面。要知道星宫虽不如宁州五派来得历史悠久、底蕴丰厚，但也是同白帝楼一般坐拥城池的存在。¤The gatekeeper has never seen this scene. You must know that although the Star Palace is not as long and rich in history as the five factions of Ning Province, it is also an existence that sits on the city like the White Emperor Tower.
倒是冲虚前辈名为元婴修士却实力不济，在占据先机的情况下仍不是我对手。¤On the contrary, Senior Chongxu's name is Yuan Ying cultivator, but his strength is not good, and he is still not my opponent even when he has the upper hand.
你正准备先寒暄两句，之后再找由头触怒冲虚散人，他却急不可耐的攻将上来。虽有些意外，但也正中你下怀。¤You were about to say a few words of greetings first, and then find a reason to offend the Xu Sanren, but he was impatient to attack. Although it is a bit unexpected, it is also in your favor.
是你！之前在林府大典上害我星宫丢尽颜面，今日竟然还敢上门闹事！真当我星宫无人不成！¤It's you! Before, at the Lin Mansion Grand Ceremony, I caused my Xinggong to lose face, but today I dare to come to the house to make trouble! I really think that no one in my star palace is unstoppable!
没成想你们这看门弟子竟敢对我出言不逊甚至还直接出手，这都算了，冲虚散人作为元婴长老，也是是非不分，上来就要置我于死地。若不是我神通了得，只怕是会立毙于此。¤I never imagined that you disciples would dare to speak rudely to me or even take action directly. That’s all. As the Nascent Soul Elder, Chongxu Sanren doesn’t distinguish right from wrong. If it weren't for my supernatural powers, I'm afraid I would have died here.
冲虚道友何必如此焦躁，我可是好心帮星宫调教弟子，你应该感谢我才是。¤Why is Daoist Chongxu so anxious? I am kind enough to help Xinggong train the disciples. You should thank me for that.
小友境界虽有不足，实力却很不错，但在我星宫出手，甚至打伤两位长老，想必目的不会是这么简单吧？¤Although the realm of the little friend is insufficient, the strength is very good, but in my star palace, and even injuring the two elders, the purpose must not be so simple, right?
终须有日龙穿凤，莫欺少年穷啊“王前辈”，可要给我记好了。¤There must be a day when the dragon wears the phoenix, don't bully the poor, Senior Wang, but remember it for me.
呵呵，“王前辈”，你若是不知悔改，我可不介意代你师长好好教教你。¤Hehe, Senior Wang, if you don't know how to repent, I don't mind teaching you on behalf of your teacher.
何人在星宫大放厥词！¤Who is talking nonsense in the star palace!
星铃儿正想张嘴驳斥无惑真人，但话到了嘴边又咽了回去，吐了吐舌头便躲到宫主身后。正巧这二人身形相似，倒也遮了个严严实实。¤Xing Ling'er was about to open her mouth to refute the real person Wuhuo, but she swallowed the words when they reached her mouth, stuck her tongue out and hid behind the palace lord. It just so happened that the two of them were similar in shape, but they were also covered up.
哼，那事暂且不提。你今日上门打伤星宫两位长老可是有假？¤Hmm, not to mention that. You came to hurt the two elders of Xinggong today, but is it fake?
你居然真是元婴境，咳咳，但这里可是星宫的地盘，别太得意了。¤You are actually in the Nascent Soul Realm, ahem, but this is the territory of the Star Palace, don't be too proud.
冲虚散人面如死灰，无惑真人也是面露讶色，强大女修却是嘴角略微上扬，一副很感兴趣的样子，而星铃儿只是好笑的看着你，也不知她在想什么。（只有剩下的那个金丹期女修，一副不是很感兴趣的样子，不知在思考什么）¤Chongxu Sanren's face is ashen, Wuhuozhen is also surprised, but the powerful female cultivator's mouth is slightly raised, and she looks very interested, and Xing Linger just looks at you funny, I don't know what she is thinking . (Only the remaining female cultivator of the Jindan period, who is not very interested, doesn't know what to think)
此等势力被人在门口击败两位长老，其中一位还是元婴长老，这可还是头一遭。¤This kind of force was defeated by two elders at the door, one of them was the Yuan Ying elder, which was the first time.
实在是抱歉，但晚辈也确是事出有因才拜访星宫。¤I'm really sorry, but the juniors did visit the Star Palace for a reason.
正当你嘲笑冲虚散人时，一位看不出深浅的女修带着另一名大概金丹初期的女修来到大殿，却只是走到一旁，也不言语，只是遣散了两位守门弟子，而后便立于一旁。¤Just when you were laughing at Chongxu Sanren, a female cultivator who could not see the depth brought another female cultivator who was probably in the early stage of Jindan to the main hall, but just walked aside without saying a word, just dismissed the two gatekeeper disciples. , and then stood aside.
正当你嘲笑冲虚散人时，一位看不出深浅的女修带着星铃儿来到大殿，也不言语，只是遣散了两位守门弟子，而后便立于一旁。倒是星铃儿一副很感兴趣的样子。¤Just when you were laughing at Chongxu Sanren, a female cultivator who could not see the depth brought Xing Linger to the main hall, without saying a word, just dismissed the two gatekeeper disciples, and then stood aside. On the contrary, Xing Linger looked very interested.
这不是冲虚道友么？我...¤Isn't this Daoist Chongxu? I...
眼见你一边调侃着冲虚散人，一边将目光投过来，两位被吓傻的守门弟子也是木讷的点点头，下意识地表示赞同。¤Seeing that you were teasing the rushing people while casting your eyes, the two guarded disciples who were frightened and stupid nodded, subconsciously agreeing.
而且，实力不济就不要逞强嘛，当着一众弟子出手却被打得灰头土脸的可不风光。¤Moreover, if you are not strong enough, don't be brave. It's not good to be beaten in front of a group of disciples.
好了，无惑师徒确实做的不对，小友你也不用再奚落他二人了。还是让冲虚自己来说说突破的事吧。可有此事？¤Well, Wuhuo's master and apprentice are indeed doing something wrong, little friend, you don't need to ridicule the two of them anymore. Let Chong Xu talk about the breakthrough. Can there be such a thing?
事出反常必有妖，还是小心为妙。¤If something goes wrong, there must be a demon. It's better to be careful.
你不甘心地四处搜寻，可惜没过多久，洞窟内便恢复了平静。¤You were unwilling to search around, but it didn't take long for you to restore peace in the cave.
隐约中，你似乎看到一条通体鲜红的巨大蛇身盘踞于前方。还未来得及等你细细观察，只听身后传来细微的响声。¤Vaguely, you seem to see a huge, bright red snake body entrenched in the front. It's still time to wait for you to observe carefully, only to hear the slight noise coming from behind.
你对火之道的感悟颇深，已经能够轻松感知到周天火灵气的活跃情况。¤You have a deep understanding of the way of fire, and you can easily perceive the aura of Zhou Tianhuo.
不入虎穴，焉得虎子。若是就这么逃了，岂非白白放过一次机缘。¤If you don't enter the tiger's lair, you won't be a tiger. If you just escaped like this, wouldn't it be a chance for nothing?
这里本就是一处少见的火属性洞窟，周天火灵气异常活跃。但如此情况也绝非寻常，若不是某种火属性异宝出世，便是有修为极高的火属性大妖在此处筑巢。你决定...？¤This is a rare fire-attribute cave. Zhou Tianhuo's aura is very active. But this situation is definitely not unusual. If it is not for the birth of some kind of fire-attributed treasure, there is a fire-attribute great monster with extremely high cultivation base here. Nest here. You decide...?
随着你不断深入洞窟，你能感受到周围的气温开始迅速地攀升。¤As you continue to deepen the cave, you can feel the surrounding temperature start to rise rapidly.
你鼓起勇气朝着洞窟深处探去。很快，由于陡升的高温，洞窟内的一切水分都在快速蒸发，把所有东西都笼罩在一片迷雾之中。¤You muster up the courage to explore the depths of the cave. Soon, due to the steep high temperature, all the water in the cave is quickly evaporating, covering everything in a mist.
你想尝试感知周天火灵气的活跃情况，找到异象所处的具体位置。可惜你对火之道的感悟也只是初窥门径，一番努力后也没能找到确切的位置。¤You want to try to perceive the vitality of Zhou Tianhuo's aura and find the specific location of the vision. Unfortunately, your understanding of the way of fire is only a first glimpse, and after a lot of hard work, you have not been able to find the exact location.
嘶~¤Hiss~
一个满是红色鳞片的蛇头不知何时出现在了你的背后，巨大的蛇眼直瞪着你，似乎还带着一丝戏谑的神情。¤A snake head full of red scales appeared behind you at some point, with huge snake eyes staring at you, seemingly with a joking expression.
你想尝试感知周天火灵气的活跃情况，找到异象所处的具体位置。可惜你对火之道的感悟一窍不通，一番努力后也没能找到确切的位置。¤You want to try to perceive the vitality of Zhou Tianhuo's aura and find the specific location of the vision. Unfortunately, you don't know anything about the way of fire, and after a lot of hard work, you haven't been able to find the exact location.
不仅仅是这洞窟之内，你能感知到周天的火灵气都在快速地朝着一个方向涌去。此等异象与其说是异宝出世，倒是更像是有什么修为远高于你的人或妖在此地突破！¤Not only in this cave, you can perceive that Zhou Tian’s fire spirit is rushing in one direction quickly. Such visions are not so much the birth of a strange treasure, but more like a cultivation base. The man or the demon for you breaks through here!
刚刚比试的结果都已经出来了，马上开始本届宗门大比的决赛！¤The results of the competition just now have come out, and the finals of the Zongmen Grand Competition will begin immediately!
可惜，可惜...¤It's a pity, a pity...
{FirstName}{shixiong}不愧是上一届门派大比的冠军，实力果然不俗。¤{FirstName}{shixiong} deserves to be the champion of the previous martial arts competition, and the strength is really good.
{FirstName}{shixiong}这段时间真是进步神速啊，我看他今年很希望夺魁。¤{FirstName}{shixiong} has made rapid progress during this period. I think he hopes to win the first prize this year.
刚刚比试的结果都已经出来了，那么第四轮比试，就由{FirstName}{LastName}对阵云秋兰。¤The results of the competition have just come out, so the fourth round of competition, the {FirstName}{LastName} against Yun Qiu Lan.
{FirstName}{shidi}，请指教。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, please advise.
哎，{FirstName}{shixiong}这样的修为还来参加宗门大比，是有些太欺负人了...¤Hey, the cultivation base of {FirstName}{shixiong} has come to participate in the Zongmen Competition. It is a bit too bullying...
哪来的魔修？！¤Where is the evil cultivator?!
魔修拿命来！¤Evil cultivator,  take this!
想要去云汐城必定经过此地，我就在这里蹲守吧。¤If you want to go to Yunxi City, you must pass this place. I'll stay here to guard.
你跳上路旁的一棵树，一边闭目调息一边等候金大勇的到来。未过多久便传来一阵脚步声，你定睛一看，正是他！¤You jumped onto a tree by the road and waited for Jin Dayong's arrival while closing your eyes and adjusting your breath. Before long, there was a sound of footsteps, and you fixed your eyes on him!
随之而来的，便是龙湛如雷似电般迅猛的攻击。¤What followed was Long Zhan's thunderous, lightning-like attack.
父亲！执迷不悟的人是你！¤Father! You are the one who insists on not understanding!
也许龙族本意并非斗争！¤Maybe the Dragon Race is not meant to fight!
父亲，你这是应允了？！¤Father, did you agree?!
你们匆忙赶到码头，百里邑与一众百里族人早已在码头驻足。远处龙族或腾空或乘浪，气势汹汹地朝着广陵城的方向行进。¤You hurried to the pier, Bailiyi and a group of Baili people have already stopped at the pier. In the distance, the dragons may vacate or ride the waves, marching aggressively in the direction of Guangling City.
好你个百里小儿，竟敢作弄于我！¤Well, you baili child, dare to fool me!
我这便将其送还给龙族长老！{xiongdi}不妨和我一起？¤I will return it to the elder of the dragon clan! {xiongdi} might as well be with me?
但先前的协议已定好，如今是他们毁约在前。¤But the previous agreement has been finalized, and now they are the first to break the contract.
百里邑攥紧了拳头，沉默半晌后长长地叹了口气，紧握的手也缓缓地松开。¤Bailiyi clenched his fists, sighed long after a long silence, and slowly loosened the clenched hands.
龙吟声隐隐传来，成群结队的龙族以乘风破浪之势离码头愈来愈近。¤The sound of dragons faintly heard, and groups of dragons are getting closer and closer to the dock, riding the wind and waves.
父亲！只要我们将龙珠还给龙族...¤Father! As long as we return the dragon ball to the dragon clan...
百里族人听令，准备迎敌！¤The Baili people obey the order and prepare to meet the enemy!
够了！¤enough!
龙珠可还在你身上？¤Dragon pearl is still on you?
整座城池笼罩在不安与恐惧的阴影下，所有人脸上都是相同的慌张与惧怕。¤The whole city is Shielded in the shadow of anxiety and fear, and everyone has the same panic and fear on their faces.
你看看这些族人，看看城中的百姓，难道我们要连累广陵城的居民一直过这样提心吊胆的日子吗！¤Look at these tribesmen and the people in the city. Are we going to make the residents of Guangling City have such a frightening life!
你依百里奇所言看向那些人们，未接触过海兽的弟子们流露出些许惊惧的神色，而百姓早已乱作一团。¤You look at those people according to what Bailiqi said. The disciples who have not been in contact with the sea beasts showed a little frightened look, and the people have long been in a mess.
逆子！不要执迷不悟！¤Nizi! Don't be obsessed with understanding!
罢了，这件事也是该做个了结了。¤Forget it, this matter should be closed.
显然百里邑也将这一幕收在眼底，他的表情莫测，叫人看不出情绪。¤Obviously, Bailiyi is also watching this scene, his expression is unpredictable, so that people can't see the emotions.
况且无尽之海如此广阔，我百里家的儿郎莫非要在这蓬莎岛做一辈子缩头乌龟？¤Besides, the endless sea is so vast, does my son from Baili's family want to be a turtle for a lifetime on Pongsha Island?
原本热闹的坊市如今空无一人，地上散落着打翻的商品。街上的百姓行色匆匆，不复往日的祥和安乐。¤The original lively market is now empty, with overturned goods scattered on the ground. The people on the street are in a hurry, no longer the peace and happiness of the past.
你与百里奇一同御剑而起，向着龙族的方向飞去。你二人刚接近龙群，一道炸雷般的呼声蓦地响起。¤You and Bailiqi rose with the sword and flew in the direction of the dragon clan. Just as you two approached the dragon group, a thunderous cry suddenly sounded.
略知一二。¤I know a little bit about it.
道友有所不知，这碎星商会虽说是由我们三家共同管理，但却是轮流做庄，每个长老都有权力对会长发起生死挑战，而会长必须接受挑战。¤The first thing you need to know is that although the three families are managing the Shattered Star Merchant Guild together, they are taking turns to be the banker, and each elder has the power to launch a life and death challenge to the president, who must accept the challenge.
那么，你约我来此，就是为了图南海之事吧？¤Then, you asked me to come here for the matter of the South China Sea, right?
哈哈哈，{FirstName}供奉果然爽快。这几日我会让人待在碎星商会，等你准备好了来找我便是。¤Hahahaha, Guest Elder {FirstName} is really quick. I'll have someone stay at the Shattered Star Merchant Guild for these few days, so come find me when you're ready.
虽说如今此人只有元婴初期修为，但据我所知，一些早已晋入元婴后期的高手也不是他的对手。¤Although this person only has an early YuanYing cultivation nowadays, as far as I know, some experts who have long since advanced to the late YuanYing stage are no match for him.
第一，我们吴家这一代长老正是青黄不接之时，无人能接下此挑战，因此只能从外族中挑选合适的供奉人选。¤First, the current generation of elders in our Wu family is at a time of youthfulness, no one can take up this challenge, so we can only select suitable candidates from the outer clan to serve as Guest Elder.
唐家族人擅于控器，此人更是少有的天才，据说能在与人对敌时精准地控制数千枚飞针法宝。¤Tang family people are good at controlling weapons, this person is a rare genius, said to be able to accurately control thousands of flying needles magic treasure when fighting against people.
而若是未做任何准备便强行突破，几乎不可能直接成功。¤And if you force a breakthrough without any preparation, it is almost impossible to succeed straight away.
这化神期强者虽说仍未飞升，但实际已成半仙之体。若非自身压制修为，则举手投足间便可引动天劫。¤Although the Deity Transformation powerhouse has not yet ascended, but has actually become a semi-immortal body. If not for their own suppression of cultivation, then the act of raising their hands can trigger the heavenly calamity.
原来如此...那么，我还有最后一个问题。¤So that's it... Then, I have one last question.
若道友能助我们吴家在这次比试中得胜，那这颗混元仙体丹便归道友了。¤If Daoist can help our Wu family win this competition, then this Mixed Immortal Body Pill will be yours.
何况，这混元仙体丹虽好，也得有命拿才行。道友若无获胜之把握，恐怕也不会轻易答应吧？¤Moreover, although this Mixed Immortal Body Pill is good, you must have a life to take it. If you don't have the certainty of winning, I'm afraid you won't agree easily, right?
好，那想必道友很清楚，若是未做任何准备便强行突破，几乎不可能直接成功。¤Good, then I think you know very well, if you force a breakthrough without any preparation, it is almost impossible to succeed directly.
这生死比试，莫非只有一方死在比试中，才算决出胜负？¤This life and death competition, can only be considered a winner if one party dies in the competition?
所以{FirstName}道友和你的那位朋友在南崖城四处调查图南海的情报，我们自然是一清二楚。¤So {FirstName} daoist friend and that friend of yours in South Cliff City around to investigate the intelligence of Tu Nanhai, we naturally know everything.
一旦比试开始，生死不论。如今商会虽说暂由我们吴家管理，但此番比试若是不敌，自然就保不住这会长的位置了。¤Once the competition begins, life or death is not important. Now the Merchant Guild although temporarily managed by our Wu family, but this competition if you are not defeated, naturally will not be able to keep the president's position.
如今的碎星商会，其实是由碎星岛的唐家，白家以及我们吴家一起掌管的。¤The Shattered Star Merchant Guild today is actually run by the Tang Family of Shattered Star Island, the White Family, and our Wu Family together.
生死比试？¤A life-and-death competition?
这次对我们发起挑战的是唐家，唐家近百年来有一长老成长的很快，如今在海上已是赫赫有名的元婴期高手。¤This time the challenge to us is the Tang family, the Tang family in the last hundred years there is an elder grows very fast, now in the sea is already famous for the YuanYing stage experts.
很抱歉这次不能亲自来请你，但正值特殊时期，老夫也不得不防备着些，还请道友见谅。¤I'm sorry I couldn't come and invite you personally this time, but it's a special time and I had to be on guard, so please forgive me.
能够辅助化神的丹药极其珍贵，即便只能略微提升成功率，在各地拍卖会上也足以卖出百万以上灵石的高价。¤Pills that can aid in the Deity Transformation are extremely valuable, and even if they only slightly increase the success rate, they are enough to sell for over a million spirit stones at auctions everywhere.
若是我们吴家因为觊觎这些而失去了和你这样的强者交好的机会，那才是得不偿失之事。¤If our Wu family lost the opportunity to befriend a strong person like you because we coveted these, it would be something that would not be worth the loss.
而我们元婴期修士想要突破化神，便要经过从凡体蜕变为仙胎的过程。只有当仙性超过凡性时，方可完成蜕变，突破化神。¤And our Nascent Soul stage cultivators want to break through the Deity Transformation, they have to go through the process of metamorphosis from mortal body to nascent soul. Only when the immortal nature exceeds the mortal nature, can complete the metamorphosis and break through the Deity Transformation.
第二，我们选择不多，几位交好的老前辈或在闭关，或在海外，暂时指望不上。你能从图南海漩涡中安全出来，这样的实力便值得我们赌上一次。¤Secondly, we do not have many choices, several good old-timers are either in seclusion or overseas, so we cannot count on them for the time being. You can come out safely from the vortex of the South China Sea, such strength is worth a gamble.
好，我答应了。¤Okay, I promise.
{FirstName}道友莫急，关于此事我必会解释清楚。不知道友之前对碎星商会可有了解？¤{FirstName}Daoist friend do not rush, about this matter I will explain clearly. I don't know if you know anything about the Shattered Star Chamber before?
抱歉，我不能接受，吴长老还是另请高明吧。¤I'm sorry, I can't accept it, Elder Wu should ask for another high level.
不仅如此，最近图南海的异象也已经引起了各方的注意，若有心调查，不难发现道友与此事的关系。¤Not only that, the recent vision of the South China Sea has also attracted the attention of all parties, if you care to investigate, it is not difficult to find the relationship between the Daoist and the matter.
直说了吧，这次邀道友来此，其实是希望道友能够作为我们吴家的供奉，替我们参加这一次商会内部生死比试。¤To put it bluntly, this time I invite you to come here, in fact, I hope you can participate in this Merchant Guild internal life and death competition for us as our Wu family's Guest Elder.
原来你们是碎星商会的人..¤So you are the people of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild...
可惜...可惜...既然道友没有信心出战，那我也不勉强道友了。¤Unfortunately... It's a pity... Since you do not have the confidence to fight, I will not force you to do so.
吴长老，你派人在客栈外监视于我，又把我在图南海的事调查的一清二楚，到底是何意图？我们还是先把这事说说清楚吧。¤Elder Wu, you sent someone to spy on me outside the inn, and investigated me in Tu Nanhai, what exactly is your intention? Let's talk this over first.
只要道友答应出战，我立刻便着手安排。¤The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you agree to fight, and I will start making arrangements right away.
哈哈哈，{FirstName}道友，请坐,请坐！这是我们吴家自酿的仙酒，道友也来品尝一下吧。¤The first thing I want to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you are doing. This is our Wu family's homemade immortal wine, dao friends also come to taste it.
而这无论生死的规则不过是让比试的双方能够无所顾忌的全力出手罢了，若自觉不敌，提前认输便是。¤The rules of life and death are only to allow the two sides of the competition to go all out without fear, and if they feel they are no match, they will admit defeat in advance.
说说吧，你能拿出什么让我感兴趣的东西？¤What can you offer that will interest me?
我此时手头还有诸多事宜，恐怕不会在南崖城待太久。这比试何时开始？¤I have many matters at hand at this time, so I'm afraid I won't be in South Cliff City for long. When will this competition begin?
{FirstName}道友误会了，不管道友在图南海得到了什么，那也是凭的自己的实力和机缘。¤{FirstName}Daoist friend misunderstood, no matter what you got in Tu Nanhai, that is also with their own strength and chance.
我们吴家世代相传一秘方，唤作混元仙体丹。服用此丹后，能稍微提升突破至化神的成功率。¤Our Wu family has passed down a secret recipe from generation to generation, called the Hybrid Immortal Body Dan. After taking this pill, it can slightly increase the success rate of breaking through to the Deity Transformation.
吴长老，您久等了,这位便是{FirstName}前辈。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you want to do.
哈哈哈，道友无需担心。这比试虽说是由挑战者发起，我们作为应战的一方，却有在一定范围内选择时间与地点的权力。¤Hahaha, there is no need to worry, fellow Daoist. Although this competition is initiated by the challenger, we, as the responding party, have the power to choose the time and place within a certain range.
我的对手是什么实力？¤What is the strength of my opponent?
（难怪他们如此小心，原来是在防备另外两个家族...）¤（No wonder they are so careful, it turns out that they are guarding against the other two families...）
道友是想问，我们为何要选你么？¤You want to ask, why we should choose you?
这比试既然号称不论生死，想必极其危险。我可以替你们参加比试，但有些问题还得先问清楚。¤Since this competition is claimed to be regardless of life and death, it must be extremely dangerous. I can participate in the competition for you, but there are some questions that need to be asked first.
自然不是，不过元婴间的比试不用全力便罢了，一旦全力以赴，很难强行收手。¤Naturally not, but the competition between the firstborn does not have to be at full strength, and once it is at full strength, it is difficult to force it to stop.
万鳞甲？¤Ten thousand scale armor?
上古时期，每一任龙皇登基，金丹期以上的鳞甲水族都会献上身上最硬的鳞片，炼制而成的龙族至宝，据说不论是炼制手法还是材料已经全部失传，没想到老夫我还能得见。¤In the ancient times, every dragon emperor ascended the throne, the scaled water clan above the Jindan period would present the hardest scales on their bodies, and the dragon treasures made by refining, it is said that both the refining methods and materials have all been lost. can be seen.
这傀儡存留至今竟还有元婴期实力，上古龙族还真是厉害。¤This puppet still has the strength of Yuanying period, and the ancient dragon family is really powerful.
比起现在龙族龟缩一隅，很难想象上古龙族的辉煌啊。¤Compared with the current dragon clan, it is difficult to imagine the glory of the ancient dragon clan.
空中悬浮着一件内甲¤A piece of inner armor is suspended in the air
这难道是？万鳞甲？？！！！¤Is this? Ten thousand scale armor? ? ! ! !
呼...呼...¤Huh...huh...
真想有一天可以去星宫看看。¤I really want to go to the Star Palace one day.
所谓化神，实际是蜕凡为仙的过程。化神之后，仙体初成，力量也会大增，与一般的元婴期修士相比已如云泥之别。¤The so-called Deity Transformation is actually the process of transforming the mortal into immortals. After the Deity Transformation, the immortal body is first formed, and the strength will be greatly increased, which is as different as the ordinary cultivators in the Nascent Soul period.
宁州各派交好，一方面是为了合作抵御魔修的侵扰，另一方面也是忌惮彼此的实力。真正涉及到一些重要的资源争夺时，依旧还是实力说话。¤Ning Province's various factions make good relations, on the one hand, to cooperate to resist the intrusion of evil cultivators, on the other hand, it is also to fear each other's strength. When it comes to some important resource competition, it is still the strength to speak.
元婴期相较于金丹期，有一极大的不同。你凝练出的元婴，作为你的第二元神，也和本体一样可以修炼功法。¤The Nascent Soul Stage is very different from the Golden Core Stage. The Nascent Soul that you condense, as your second soul, can also practice the exercises just like the body.
因此，大部分化神期强者都会选择隐世闭关，凝练力量，为渡劫做好准备。不到万不得已，轻易不会出面，这也算是一种约定俗成的规矩。¤Therefore, most of the strong people in the Deity Transformation will choose to retreat from the world, condense their strength, and prepare for the tragedy. If they are not a last resort, they will not come forward easily. This is also a customary rule.
{shidi}难道未曾想过，为何修真界会有宗门，家族之分？¤Has {shidi} never thought about why there are sects and families in the cultivation world?
如果说金丹期的长老们是门派的中流砥柱，那元婴期则是一个门派真正的底蕴与底牌所在。¤If the Jindan stage elders are the mainstays of the sect, then the Nascent Soul realm is the true background and card of a sect.
我们宁州的五大门派之所以能够有如今的地位，也是因为门派内至少能一个元婴期修士坐阵。如今我派可谓实力大增，日后在宁州的话语权也不可同日而语。¤The reason why the five sects of Ning Province have their current status is also because at least one Nascent Soul cultivator can sit in the sect. Now our Sect can be said to have greatly increased its strength, and its power to speak in Ning Province will not be the same in the future.
按门内秘籍记载，当修为达到元婴巅峰后，体内灵气与元婴凝练皆已达到顶峰，此时便可借此机会重塑凡体，淬炼神魂。¤According to the secret book in the door, when the cultivation base reaches the peak of the Nascent Soul, the spiritual energy and the Nascent Soul condensing in the body have reached the peak. At this time, you can take this opportunity to reshape the mortal body and temper the soul.
如果能渡过天劫，自然得以飞升上界。而一旦失败，则千余年修为毁于一旦。¤If you can survive the catastrophe, you will naturally be able to ascend to the upper realm. If you fail, your cultivation base will be destroyed for more than a thousand years.
如果我没记错的话，{FirstName}{shidi}如今应该还不到三百岁吧。¤If I remember correctly, {FirstName}{shidi} should be less than 300 years old now.
自然不是，这还要从化神期修士的本质说起...¤Naturally not, this has to start with the essence of the cultivator in the Deity Transformation stage...
如果我没记错的话，{FirstName}{shidi}如今应该还不到五百岁吧。¤If I remember correctly, {FirstName}{shidi} should be less than 500 years old now.
那心魔的反噬确实恐怖，我现在想来也有些后怕...¤That inner demon's backlash is indeed terrifying, and I am also a little scared after thinking about it...
如果我没记错的话，{FirstName}{shidi}应该已有{$sui}余岁了吧。¤If I remember correctly, {FirstName}{shidi} should be over {$sui}.
难道...各派都没有化神期实力的强者么？¤Isn't there...there is no Deity Transformation in the various factions?
寻常的金丹期修士只有五百年寿元，想必师弟此番能够突破，也是遇到了一些属于自己的机缘。¤The ordinary Golden Core stage Cultivator only has five hundred years of life. I think the younger brother can break through this time, but also encounter some opportunities that belong to him.
想起当年本座结婴时的情景，至今还历历在目。那心魔会幻化成你内心最害怕和最恐惧的东西，若是没有一颗坚定的道心，便会落得一个魂飞魄散的下场。¤Think of the scene when this seat gave broke through, and it is still vivid. The heart demon will turn into the most feared and feared thing in your heart. If you don't have a firm Taoist heart, you will end up with a soul-stirring end.
然而天地之间自有法则束缚，力量过强便会被天地排斥。化神期强者若是全力出手便会破碎虚空，引来天劫。¤However, there are rules between the heaven and the earth, and if the strength is too strong, the heaven and the earth will be repelled. If the power of the Deity Transformation stage makes a full shot, the void will be broken and the heaven will be caused.
据我所知，能在如此年纪便突破元婴期的修士并非没有过，但也不过寥寥数十人而已。{shidi}未来成就不可限量啊。¤As far as I know, cultivators who can break through the Nascent Soul Stage at such an age are not uncommon, but there are only a few dozen of them. {shidi} The future is limitless.
若非我事先服用了一枚{$Var}，想必我也难以熬过那种心神淬炼的折磨。¤If I hadn't taken a {$Var} beforehand, it would be hard for me to survive the torture of tempering my mind.
当凡性褪去，仙格显现，便是一鼓作气突破化神之时。此时若能成功突破，便可凝聚仙人之体，否则将修为大退，功亏一篑。¤When the mortal nature fades and the immortal grid appears, it is the time to break through the Deity Transformation. If you can successfully break through at this time, you can condense the body of the immortal.
元婴修炼功法后，能够获得许多特殊的神通。而根据元婴所修炼功法的{color=#d0380a}属性{/color}不同，能够获得的神通也各不相同。¤After the Nascent Soul practices the exercises, he can obtain many special supernatural powers. According to the different {color=#d0380a}attributes{/color} of the Nascent Soul practice, the magical powers that can be obtained are also different.
我困在元婴期多年，一直无法更进一步，但在修炼上还是有一些独到的体会。¤I have been trapped in the Nascent Soul realm for many years and have been unable to go further, but I still have some unique experience in cultivation.
而宁州大大小小可供修炼的灵脉，无一不是被各大门派与家族所占据着。宗门为弟子提供安全的修炼场地，但同样也需要依托整个宗门的实力，才有资格占据这样的宝地。¤And the spiritual veins available for cultivation in Ning Province, large and small, are all occupied by various sects and families. The sect provides a safe practice ground for disciples, but it also depends on the strength of the entire sect. Qualified to occupy such a treasure.
{FirstName}{shidi}，要知道金丹期修士能够结成元婴者，万中无一，而且个个都是天纵奇才。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, you must know that there is no one in a million who can form a Nascent Infant with a golden core cultivator, and all of them are heavenly wizards.
我只当宁州各派一向交好，莫非...¤I only think that the various factions in Ning Province have always been good friends, could it be...
我当年也是与你差不多年纪的时候才凝结成婴，以{shidi}你的资质，未来成就定当不弱于我。¤I formed a nascent soul when I was about the same age as you. With {shidi} your qualifications, the future achievements must be no weaker than me.
是来协助巡山的外门{shidi}吗？¤Is it the outer gate {shidi} who came to assist in patrolling the mountain?
宗门重地，办完事{shidi}还是速速离去。¤The sect is important, {shidi} will leave quickly after finishing the business.
此地乃宗门重地，若是无事{shidi}还是不要多做逗留。¤This place is the important place of the sect. If nothing happens {shidi}, don't stay longer.
可是来协助巡山内门{shidi}？目前人手空缺，{shidi}的到来也是解了燃眉之急。¤But come to assist {shidi} to patrol the inner gate of the mountain? There are currently vacancies. The arrival of {shidi} is also a relief.
既然是内门来的{shidi}，势必实力不差，核心区域的值守点就交由{shidi}了。¤Since {shidi} is from the inner door, it is bound to be strong, and the guard point in the core area will be handed over to {shidi}.
{shidi}以你的实力，我就把你安排在外围区域的值守点。\n¤{shidi}With your strength, I will arrange you at the guard point in the outer area.\n
我这就前去。¤I'm going now.
你似乎偶有所悟，心境得到了提升。¤You seem to have realized occasionally, and your mood has improved.
所谓的坊市，就是以物易物，各取所需。¤The so-called market is bartering things, and everyone gets what they need.
神仙打架总在天上，可是这悲欢离合，多在人世间啊...¤The gods fight in the sky, but the joys and sorrows are mostly in the world...
可惜冥冥之中自有定数，即使是金丹期修士也逃不过天道的无常，这一次意外之行令你感悟颇多。¤It's a pity that there is a certain number in the world, even the golden core cultivators can't escape the impermanence of the heavens. This unexpected trip has made you feel a lot.
一阵天旋地转过后，你回到了正阳山外，想来这传送机关是当时他为自己留下的后路。¤After a while, you are back outside Mt. Rising Sun, thinking that this teleportation mechanism was the escape he left for himself at the time.
听说广陵城的万宝行，什么天才地宝都能买到，真想有机会去见识一下。¤I heard that in the Wanbaohang of Guangling City, you can buy any genius treasures. I really want to have a chance to see it.
洞府也不是谁人都能买的。道友若是想要购买洞府还是需要宁州声望到达略有薄名。¤Not everyone can buy a cave. If you want to buy a cave, you must be slightly famous in Ning Province with your reputation to even be considered.
我宁州有一座巨大的灵脉为玄道宗所控制，其上建立城池，道友可知是哪里？¤There is a huge spiritual vein in my Ning Province controlled by the Mystic Dao Sect, on which a city is built, do you know which city im referring to friend?
那就是逸风城，玄道宗更是指派了所谓的宁王前去管理，道友若是想要购买洞府不妨去逸风府看看。¤That is Yifeng City, and the Mystic Dao Sect has even assigned the so-called Ning King to manage it. If you want to buy a cave, you may wish to visit Yifeng House.
请问...\n¤May I ask...\n
洞府之中，道友可自行布置灵田、炼丹房、炼器室，修炼速度更不是我们这种客栈可以比的。¤In the cave, you can set up your own spirit field to farm herbs, alchemy room to create Pills, weapon room to forge your materials, and the cultivation speed is incomparable to an shabby inn of our level.
她陷入了沉思。你也没有再说什么，只是等她独自思考。¤She fell into contemplation. You also did not say anything else, just waiting for her to think alone.
既然你有无限的生命，那么就有无限的可能。¤Since you have infinite life, then there are infinite possibilities.
她告诉我，镇里的人欺负我只是因为害怕我，怕我给镇上带来什么不好的东西，想把我赶出去。¤She told me that the people of the town bullied me just because they were afraid of me, afraid that I would bring something bad to the town and wanted to drive me out.
它可以逍遥自在，也可以一方为王；可以与人类交好，也可以与妖兽为伴。¤It can be free and easy, but also a party for the king; can be friendly with humans, but also with the Spirit Beast as a companion.
今后…我还没有考虑过…¤In the future...I haven't thought about it...
她？¤She?
还要不要坚持原来的目标呢？¤Still want to stick to the original goal?
（腼腆地）可…不知道究竟有没有办法可以飞升成功…¤(Coyly) can... I wonder if there is actually a way to ascend successfully...
（腼腆地）三妹并不是模仿的别人…而是诞生于我们的自我怀疑。¤(coyly) The third sister is not an imitation of someone else...but was born out of our self-doubt.
多谢荧儿。只是不知荧儿可有想好以后的打算？¤Thank you, Fluorescence. Just do not know if fluorescence child has thought about the future plans?
那荧儿便在此好生养伤罢，相信借助气旋与神阴石，不日便能恢复如初。¤I believe that with the help of the qi spiral and the divine yin stone, she will be able to recover in a few days.
（腼腆地）那…你以后还会来吗？¤(coyly) So...will you come back later?
道别后，你便离开了这座充满不幸的岛。¤After saying goodbye, you left this island of misfortune.
唉…只是不知道又要修炼多久…¤Alas...I just don't know how long it will take to cultivate again...
（腼腆地）可…如果不这样的话，我存在的意义又是什么呢…¤(Coyly) But... if not, what is the point of my existence...
（腼腆地）快住手，{ta}是我朋友！¤(coyly) Stop it, {ta} is my friend!
你们究竟是谁？¤Who exactly are you?
日后若有机会，我一定会来看望荧儿。¤I will definitely come and visit Fluorescence in the future if I get the chance.
但是有很多东西都在告诉我，其实我不是。¤But there are many things that are telling me that I am actually not.
但是在此之前，我们得先把损失掉的阴气吸收回来~¤But before that, we have to absorb the lost Yin Qi back first~
（腼腆地）嗯，再见啦~¤(coyly) Well, goodbye~
每次被人欺负的时候，她便会站出来保护我，就像那个大姐姐一样。¤Every time I was bullied, she would come forward to protect me, just like the big sister.
直到今天，我都不知道她的想法。¤Until today, I didn't even know what she was thinking.
这些东西虽然越来越难理解，不过最后也都没有难住我。¤These things are getting harder and harder to understand, but in the end, they are not difficult for me.
但每次它都会总结前一次失败的经验。¤But each time it will summarize the experience of the previous failure.
（腼腆地）嗯…你想知道什么？¤(Coyly) Well...what do you want to know?
但现在你解释这些，不会陷入自我怀疑嘛？¤But now you are explaining this, won't you fall into self-doubt?
没想到随着这些想法越来越多，她也慢慢成长为一个人格。¤I didn't expect that as these thoughts grew, she slowly grew into a personality.
在它克服掉所有困难之后，最终它终于成为了金鹏。¤After it overcame all the difficulties, it finally became a golden roc.
（腼腆地）我在变成人以后，就一直坚信自己是人，二姐也告诉我我是人。¤(Coyly) I have been convinced that I am human since I became human, and my second sister also told me that I am human.
不知荧儿今后将作何打算？¤I don't know what Fluorescence's future plans will be?
人类修士修行，大抵也只是为了寻觅长生而已。¤Human cultivators cultivate, most of them are only in search of long life.
它一次次想要融入金鹏，又一次次失败。¤It tried to integrate into the golden roc again and again, and again and again failed.
我变成过山石、河流、草木、妖兽……甚至还变成过一轮小一点的月亮。¤I have turned into mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, Spirit Beasts ...... and even a smaller moon.
（腼腆地）嗯…我们会一起聊聊这件事，如果顺利的话，应该会坚持下去吧…¤(Coyly) Well...we will talk about this together, and if it goes well, it should stick...
我们感应到的，并不是那里…而是，别的东西…¤What we sense, is not there...but, something else...
（腼腆地）……¤(Coyly) ......
（腼腆地）这是我准备飞升时所想到的一些东西，也不知道对你有没有用，总之先送给你啦~¤(Coyly) This is something I thought of when I was preparing to ascend, and I don't know if it's useful to you, but I'll give it to you first ~
一连串问题在你脑海中闪过，却没有答案。¤A series of questions flash through your mind, but there is no answer.
迅速浏览一遍后，那玉简便悄然消失了，只剩下一些你暂时还理解不了的东西留在了你的脑海中。¤After quickly browsing through it, the jade simplicity quietly disappears, leaving only something you can't understand for the time being left in your mind.
哈哈哈哈哈，既然你早就决定好了道路，又有何好纠结的？¤Hahahahahahaha, since you have long decided on the path, what is there to dwell on?
（腼腆地）但是……¤(Coyly) But ......
片刻后，她用自身阴气模拟出了一个“玉简”递给了你。¤A few moments later, she used her own Yin Qi to simulate a 'jade slip' and handed it to you.
就当我以为没有东西可以难到我的时候，我遇到了她。¤Just when I thought nothing could be difficult to me, I met her.
场面安静了下来。你一时也想不到什么想说的，便觉已是分别之时。¤The scene has quieted down. You can not think of anything you want to say for a while, then you feel that it is already the time to separate.
（冷静地）…三妹便是如此，天赋最高，但也最为疯狂。¤(Calmly)... This is the case with the third sister, the most talented, but also the most crazy.
（冷静地）的确也没什么好隐瞒的了。¤(Calmly) Indeed, there is nothing to hide.
此前多有冒犯，道友还请见谅。¤Please forgive me if I have offended you before.
话说回来，我都以为你们已经飞升成功了，后来又是如何失败的？¤That said, I thought you had succeeded in your ascension, how did you fail later?
但有一个大姐姐不一样——她很冷静，不被情绪左右，还一直保护我。¤But there was a big sister who was different - she was calm, not swayed by emotions, and always protected me.
（冷静地）三妹，休得胡来。¤(Calmly) Third sister, do not be fooled.
向之恒¤Xiang Zhiheng
我不接受这些想法，于是就把它们丢弃在了角落。¤I did not accept these ideas and discarded them in the corner.
不就是一次失败而已，在你无限的生命中，这区区数万年，不过瞬间而已，何足为虑？¤In your infinite life, these tens of thousands of years are just moments, what's the big deal?
它可以做任何自己想做的事，而不会被自己的身份限制。¤It can do whatever it wants to do without being limited by its status.
（腼腆地）最开始，我只是极阴之地机缘巧合所生、一团有灵智的阴气而已。¤(Coyly) In the beginning, I was just a spiritual cloud of Yin Qi born by chance in the Land of Extreme Yin.
李司魂¤Li Si Soul
它最后没有融入金鹏，也没有回归灵雀，它便是它自己，唯一一只会修炼的灵雀。¤It finally did not integrate into the Golden Roc, nor did it return to the Spiritual Bird, it is itself, the only Spiritual Bird that can cultivate.
这样的结局，荧儿是否满意呢？¤Such an ending, fluorescent child is satisfied with it?
那三妹又是在模仿谁呢？¤And who is the third sister imitating?
（腼腆地）嗯…我们会一起聊聊这件事，如果顺利的话，应该会融为一体吧…¤(Coyly) Well... we will talk about this together, and if it goes well, we should become one...
荧儿，都告诉{ta}吧。¤I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get a good deal on this.
原来如此…这么说，当年你二姐不让我追问，其实是不想让你陷入自我怀疑？¤I see... So, your second sister didn't let me ask questions, in fact, she didn't want you to fall into self-doubt?
……罢了，既然事已至此，阁下的过往可否告知一二？¤...... just, since things have come to this, can you tell us a little bit about your past?
这就是你看到的二姐。¤This is the second sister you see.
无尘¤Dustless
那你的二姐又是怎么来的？¤Then how did your second sister come?
从此它便可以与金鹏同伴一起，上天入地，逍遥自在！¤From then on it can be with the golden roc companion, up into the sky, free and easy!
后来她不在了，我很想她，但是我又没有办法把她融入到本体的人格，于是就模仿了她的人格。¤Then she was gone, and I missed her, but I had no way to integrate her into my own personality, so I imitated her personality.
她会怎么想呢？再见到的时候还会是她么？¤What will she think? Will it be her when we see each other again?
自我怀疑？¤Self-doubt?
如果是之前的话肯定会，但在飞升失败之后，我反而能接受这些想法了。¤If it was before then definitely, but after the failed ascension, I can accept these ideas instead.
只要坚定了自己的信念，一次次累积经验，又有什么可以难倒你？¤As long as you are firm in your beliefs and accumulate experience again and again, what can be difficult for you?
三妹虽然性格很奇怪，但却是个天才，有很多我和二姐都办不到的事情，她却能做到。¤Although the third sister has a strange personality, but is a genius, there are many things that I and the second sister can not do, but she can do.
你既然从一开始便就是不死不灭的存在，再变成人修行、岂不是本末倒置？¤Since you are an immortal being from the beginning, would it not be putting the cart before the horse to become a human being?
你注意到她的语气中带有几分惭愧。¤You notice that her tone is a bit ashamed.
就当她准备再次出手时，全身突然剧烈地抖动起来。你能感受到他身上的暴戾慢慢消失不见，冷静与善良逐渐占据上风。¤Just when she was ready to strike again, her whole body suddenly trembled violently. You can feel the violence in his body slowly disappeared, calm and kindness gradually prevailed.
当年你不是好奇那只灵雀的结局嘛？¤When you were curious about the end of that spirit bird?
她很可爱，很善良，但有时候又会做出一些我完全没法理解的举动…¤She's cute and kind, but sometimes she does things that I can't understand at all...
（腼腆地）后来我来到了一个人类的小镇，但那里的人都觉得我是异类，都欺负我…¤(Coyly) Then I came to a human town, but the people there thought I was a foreigner and bullied me...
“罢了，此事还是不要多问为好…”¤It's just that it's better not to ask too many questions about this...
魏无极¤Wei Wuji
她究竟能不能飞升？如果真的不能飞升的话，她会一直去尝试，又一直失败，陷入痛苦的循环嘛？¤Can she actually ascend? If she really can't ascend, she will keep trying and failing, falling into a painful cycle?
那个时候一切都充满了未知，我理解事物的唯一方法，就是变成那个东西。¤Everything was full of unknowns at that time, and the only way for me to understand things was to become that thing.
你是二姐？此前那人究竟是什么人？为何突然对我出手？¤You are the second sister? Who was that person before this? Why did he suddenly strike at me?
依我看，每个人都有所不同，为何一定要变成别人呢？¤In my opinion, everyone is different, so why do we have to become someone else?
她的眼角似乎有白色的阴气逸散开来，就好像在流泪一样，你能感受到她的失落。¤There seems to be white yin energy escaping from the corners of her eyes, as if she is shedding tears, and you can feel her loss.
嗯…就是我现在变成的那个人。¤Well...is the one I am now becoming.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来邀请你届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to invite you to come and observe the ceremony.
白鹿也不言语，只是点了点头表示回复，而后便开始认真检查请帖的内容。¤White Deer did not say a word, but merely nodded in reply, and then began to examine the contents of the invitation in earnest.
好。我会前往。¤Good. I will travel.
哈哈哈哈，先说好了，我可不会留手。¤Hahahahaha, let's say it first, I won't hold back my hand.
这是自然…没想到真能在擂台上一战。¤This is natural...I didn't expect to really have a battle in the ring.
哈哈哈，我们又见面了。¤Hahahaha, we meet again.
天机大比{$dixlun}，由{FirstName}{LastName}对阵{$TmpStrValue}！¤The Tianji Grand Tournament {$dixlun}, the {FirstName}{LastName} versus {$TmpStrValue}!
来吧。¤Come on.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，可还记得当年的约定？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, do you still remember the agreement back then?
浪方大圣张开如夜空一般的大口，一股不可阻挡的恐怖吸引力将周遭所有的灵气、海水、妖兽、船只全部吸入体内...¤The Great Sage Langfang opened his mouth like the night sky, and an unstoppable terrifying attraction sucked all the aura, sea water, monsters, and ships into his body...
这位{gongzi}，要参加下一次的拍卖会么？入场费只要10灵石噢~¤This {gongzi}, do you want to participate in the next auction? The entrance fee is only 10 spirit stones~
{gongzi}，这是我们拍卖行的传音符印记，日后{gongzi}若是想知道最新的拍品情况，直接用{color=#d0380a}传音符{/color}与我们联系便可。¤{gongzi}, this is our auction house's voice talisman seal, in the future {gongzi} if you want to know the latest lot situation, directly use {color=#d0380a} voice talisman {/color} to contact us can.
按照惯例，在拍卖成功后，我们还会收取您成交价的10%作为抽水。不过若是物品流拍，就不会再另外收取费用啦。¤According to the usual practice, after the auction is successful, we will also charge you 10% of the transaction price as a margin. However, if the item fails to auction, no additional fees will be charged.
为了保证拍卖会的质量，我们会请专门的鉴定师对拍品进行鉴定。因此，所有价值低于50灵石的物品都是不允许在这里寄卖的。¤In order to ensure the quality of the auction, we will ask a special appraiser to appraise the lot. Therefore, all items with a value of less than 50 spirit stones are not allowed to be sold here.
不知这宁州古迹的传承中有没有神识绝学...¤I don't know if there is a fascinating knowledge in the heritage of this ancient site in Ning Province...
我曾听老祖提及，宁州古迹乃是上古时期的古原城坍塌而成，而那古原城以城主建立的...什么殿最为出名，其内似乎有着十分强大的功法传承。¤I have heard from the ancestors that the ancient ruins of Ning Province were formed by the collapse of an ancient city in the ancient times, and that ancient city was built by the city lord...what palace is the most famous, and it seems to have a very powerful inheritance of exercises.
你眼前是一片灵药田，不同于你之前所见的药田，其中有丝丝龙脉之力散发而出。¤In front of you is a field of spiritual medicine, which is different from the medicine field you have seen before, in which the power of dragon veins radiates.
可惜了，此地荒废太久了。¤It's a pity that this place has been deserted for too long.
嗯，龙族相较于我们人族，堪称天之宠儿。¤Well, compared to our human race, the dragon race is called the darling of heaven.
你神识扫过药田，并没有什么发现。¤You soul sense swept through the medicine field, and did not find anything.
这灵药园应该是龙族培养药材的地方，更容易催生出龙皇果之类的药材。¤This Spirit Medicine Garden should be the place where the Dragon Clan cultivates medicinal materials, and it is easier to produce medicinal materials such as Dragon Emperor Fruit.
画中，右上角一条吞云蟒盘踞在云中，左下角一名老者正骑着仙鹤，二者凌空对视，似在斗法。¤In the painting, the upper right corner of a cloud-swallowing python coiled in the clouds, the lower left corner of an old man is riding an immortal crane, the two are looking at each other in the air, seems to be fighting.
右下角，一只白狐翘着尾巴蹲坐在地面，向空中望去，似在观摩。画面栩栩如生，你仿佛能看到当年一人一蟒斗法的场景。¤In the lower right corner, a white fox sitting on the ground with its tail crouched, looking into the air, as if watching. The picture is vivid, you seem to be able to see the scene of a person and a python fighting back then.
你飞上山峰向下望去，这地面表面上平平无奇，但小坑中那若有若无的灵气联系起来后，却赫然形成了一幅画。¤You fly up the mountain and look down. The surface of the ground is unremarkable, but the vague aura in the small pit is connected to form a picture.
一般擅使成套的剑阵或是飞针类法宝的修士，对于灵气的操控精度都比常人更高。这等人物在海上多半也是名声显赫的一方大能，日后多留意一番，或许能打听到什么。¤Generally, cultivators who are good at using a complete set of sword arrays or flying needle magic weapons have higher precision in the manipulation of aura than ordinary people. Most of these characters are also famous at sea, and they may be able to find out something if they pay more attention in the future.
奇怪，这些小坑似乎不是自然形成的，隐约还能察觉到一丝灵气的波动...莫非是某种阵法？¤Strange, these small pits don't seem to be formed naturally, and you can vaguely detect the fluctuation of aura... Could it be some kind of formation?
普通以剑气作画，也不算什么难事。但如果想像这样将灵气凝于一点，多年不散，老夫自问也是做不到的。¤Ordinarily painting with sword energy is not difficult. But if you want to condense the spiritual energy in one point like this, it will not be scattered for many years, and the old man will not be able to do it.
你走到一片开阔地，此处杂草丛生，只是地上有一些小坑时而整齐、时而杂乱地排列着。¤You come to an open field, where weeds are overgrown, except that there are some small holes in the ground that are sometimes neatly arranged and sometimes messy.
这些灵气凝而不散，也不知保持了多少年了，真是了不起的手法。¤These auras are condensed and not scattered, and I don't know how many years they have been maintained. It is really an amazing technique.
{FirstName}道友！¤{FirstName}Daoist!
你二人道别过后，便各自离开了天魔眼。¤After you both said your goodbyes, you each left the Heavenly Demon Eye.
这些是我在天魔眼中找到的东西，你不嫌弃的话就收下吧。¤These are the things I found in the eye of the devil, so take them if you don't mind.
她迟疑了一瞬。¤She hesitated for a moment.
很久之前？莫非此前发生过什么变故？¤A long time ago? Could it be that something has changed before that?
你师兄呢？没和你在一起吗？¤Where is your brother? Not with you?
他本身修炼就快，又深受宗门器重，所以一直都是同辈中的佼佼者。¤He is a fast cultivator himself and is highly valued by the clan, so he has always been the best among his peers.
在那之后，他不仅修炼得更加努力，还经常指点师弟师妹们，宗门上下都非常喜欢他。¤After that, he not only cultivated harder, but also often instructed his junior brothers and sisters, and the whole clan was very fond of him.
变故？¤Change of heart?
这件事其实我也不太清楚，只知道以前发生过一次变故。¤I don't really know much about this, except that there was a change of heart once before.
那个时候他并不像现在这样体恤同门，反而是有些恃才傲物。¤At that time he was not as sympathetic to his fellow disciples as he is now, but rather a bit of a bully.
他护送我出来之后，便去清点其他弟子了。¤After escorting me out, he went to count the other disciples.
嗯，他身具天灵根，刚入门便被掌门看中，是掌门唯一的关门弟子。¤Well, he has heavenly spiritual roots and was spotted by the Sect Leader right after his initiation, and is the only closed disciple of the Sect Leader.
有一次，我……¤At one point, I ......
是嘛？此前他照顾你如此细致，我还以为你们之间的关系非同一般。¤Oh, really? He took such good care of you earlier that I thought you had an extraordinary relationship.
嗯……¤Ok……
我就是被你救下来的那个人，只是当时伤势太重，没来得及感谢你。¤I was the one you saved, I was just too injured to thank you at the time.
原来如此，难怪天魔眼中他照顾你如此细致。¤I see, no wonder he looked after you so meticulously in the eyes of the Heavenly Demon.
举手之劳罢了，道友不必多礼。¤It's just a handful, you don't have to be polite.
她眉飞色舞地说起了李青麟在门内的“光辉事迹”，整整说了一炷香时间才消停下来。¤She danced about Li Qinglin's ''glorious deeds'' in the gate for a whole incense stick before she stopped.
没有啦，很久之前，大师兄对同门师兄弟们就都是这样了。¤No, it's been like that for a long time now with my fellow students.
天魔眼之行结束后，你刚准备离去，突然一道声音叫住了你。¤At the end of your trip to the Heavenly Demon Eye, you are just about to leave when a voice suddenly calls out to you.
嗯…总之，这次的还是要谢谢你。¤Well...anyway, thank you for this one.
“想不到之前竟有如此变故。”¤'I never imagined that there would be such a change of heart before.''
直到那次变故后，掌门罚他闭门思过，出关时就像变了一个人似的，再也没有以前的傲气，变得越来越谦和了。¤It wasn't until after that change that the master punished him with closed-door meditation, and when he came out he was like a different person, no longer as arrogant as before and becoming more and more humble.
敢问道友是？¤May I ask if you are?
再说我们之间又没有什么特殊关系，干嘛老是待在一起？¤Besides, we don't have a special relationship, so why do we always stay together?
先是几道似有似无的雷鸣之声，由远及近。¤First, there were a few sounds of thunder that seemed to come from far away and closer.
阴风怒号，浊浪排空，日星隐曜，山岳潜形......\r\n一盏茶，一柱香的功夫，大半个海域便被笼罩在这滚滚浓云之下。¤The cloudy winds are roaring, the turbid waves are emptying, the sun and stars are hidden, and the mountains are submerged ...... \r\n a cup of tea, a column of incense, the greater part of the sea was enveloped under these rolling thick clouds.
伴随着地裂山崩般的一声炸雷，空中凝聚的墨云霎时之间疯狂起来，好似惊涛骇浪一般，向着四面八方翻涌而去，迅速遮蔽了整个天空，浩浩汤汤，无边无际......¤With an explosive thunderclap like a cracking of the earth, the ink clouds in the air suddenly became frantic, like shocking waves, surging in all directions, quickly covering the entire sky, vast and boundless ......
你体内的精纯灵气似被某种至高无上的力量牵引着，\r连带着身体周围的天地灵气一起，慢慢翻滚涌动着，再也无法抑制。¤The pure spiritual energy within you seems to be pulled by some supreme power,\r together with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth around your body, slowly tumbling and surging, unable to restrain it any longer.
你眉头一皱，意识到，{color=#d0380a}天劫{/color}就要降临了。¤Your brow furrows as you realise that {color=#d0380a}the heavenly tribulation{/color} is about to descend.
轰———————————————————————¤Boom --------- ---------- ----
一股强大的气流把你从浪方大圣的体内冲了出来，你扭头看去，只见浪方巨大的躯体正以极快的速度向着深海潜去。¤A powerful current of air rushes you out of the Great Sage of Wavefang, and you twist your head to see that Wavefang's huge body is diving towards the deep sea at a great speed.
所有人，都在翘首观望，或许，一个新的{color=#d0380a}飞升神话{/color}，就要诞生了。¤Everyone, with their fingers crossed, is watching, perhaps, as a new {color=#d0380a} soaring myth{/color}, is about to be born.
这一看，便不知过了多少万年。¤This look, then I do not know how many thousands of years have passed.
相似的剧情在你眼前一遍又一遍地不断上演。¤Similar plot in front of your eyes over and over again constantly staged.
整个世界在你的神识之下一览无余，而你却改变不了分毫，只得孤独地任由世界自行衍变。¤The whole world is visible under your divine consciousness, and you can't change a bit, you just have to be alone and let the world diffuse itself.
你看见乞讨路边的孤儿飞黄腾达，也看见高枕无忧的显贵惨遭暗算…¤You have seen orphans begging on the side of the road to rise to greatness, and you have also seen the nobleman who is resting on his laurels being assassinated...
起初，你会想改变些什么，但你做不到。¤At first, you will want to change something, but you can not do it.
看见滴水汇成江河，看见沧海化为桑田…¤Seeing drops of water become rivers, seeing the sea turn into a mulberry field...
你别无他法，只得将注意力放在这个世界上。但很快，你便被这个世界上所发生的事所吸引。¤You have no other choice but to focus on the world. But soon, you are drawn to what is happening in this world.
阁主¤Master of the Pavilion
当这个世界上最后一人死去时，所有画面戛然而止，你的神魂被强行弹出这个世界。¤When the last person in this world dies, all the images come to a screeching halt and your divine soul is forcibly ejected from this world.
看见善恶终有报，看见斗转星挪移…¤Seeing that good and evil will be rewarded in the end, seeing the stars moving around...
你注意到了一个繁华的国度，看见大街小巷里有趣的人，看见人们身上发生的故事…¤You notice a prosperous country, see interesting people in the streets and alleys, see stories happening to people...
你看见喜怒哀惧爱恶欲，看见生老病死入轮回…¤You see happiness, anger, sorrow, fear, love, evil desire, see old age, sickness and death into the cycle of reincarnation...
又过了不知多久，一场前所未有的浩劫席卷了这个世界，没有一人得以幸免。¤After another unknown period of time, an unprecedented catastrophe swept through the world, and no one was spared.
你看见为国捐躯的枯骨无人问津，也看见独揽横财的商贾八面玲珑…¤You see the dead bones for the country no one asked for, also see the sole wealth of the merchant eight sides...
这是一个没有灵力的世界。¤This is a world without spiritual power.
最后，你无动于衷。¤In the end, you are indifferent.
后来，你觉得就算改变了什么，对这个世界也毫无影响。¤Later, you feel that even if you change something, it will have no effect on the world.
化神初始仙性+4，心境+500。¤Deity Transformation initial immortality +4, mind +500.
你看见群狼环伺的小国迅速崛起，也看见盛极一时的王朝走向毁灭…¤You saw the rapid rise of a small country surrounded by wolves, but also saw the flourishing dynasty to destruction ...
老爷爷¤Old Grandpa
你看见忧国忧民的诗人饿死家中，也看见灯红酒绿的醉客逍遥自在…¤You see the poet who is worried about the country and the people starving to death at home, but also see the drunkard who is free and easy...
你看见呱呱坠地的婴儿溘然早逝，也看见行将就木的老者苟延甲子…¤You saw a baby die a premature death, and you saw an old man who was dying...
道友，若是没有需求，还是速速离开。¤Friends, if there is no demand, leave quickly.
可惜九州战乱的那数万年间，不仅各大宗门传承有损，许多古籍也下落不明。否则此等灵物，当不会完全没有记载才是。¤Unfortunately, during the tens of thousands of years of war in Kyushu, not only were the legacies of the great clans damaged, but many ancient texts were also unaccounted for. Otherwise, there would not have been no records of such spiritual objects.
那...那人到底是...¤That... Who the hell is that guy...
那个身影开始顺着光柱慢慢向上飞去，而你眼前的画面再次破碎，又一次坠入了虚空。¤The figure begins to fly slowly upwards along the pillar of light, and the image before you shatters once more, falling once more into the void.
或许不是古籍被毁，而是真的从来没有人见到过这古树的全貌吧...¤Perhaps it is not that the ancient books were destroyed, but that no one has really ever seen the ancient tree in its entirety...
这里是无尽之海？但那两只...难道是传说中的神兽玄武和鲲鹏？¤This is the Endless Sea? But those two... Could they be the legendary divine beasts Black Tortoise and Kunpeng?
你感应到什么了？¤What do you sense?
而在这片宫殿的上方，有一人凭空漂浮于半空中，负手而立。¤And above this palace, a man floats in mid-air, standing with his hands in the air.
四柄魔剑组合而成的剑阵飞速旋转，似乎正在酝酿着惊世骇俗的一击。而在你的身后，另一股强大的剑意也在慢慢凝聚。¤The sword formation formed by the combination of four magic swords is spinning rapidly, as if a stunning strike is brewing. And behind you, another powerful sword intent is slowly coalescing.
魏无极的声音彻底惊醒了你，你向四周望去，不知何时，那些原本已经静止不动的根须又开始向你靠近。¤Wei Wuji's voice wakes you up completely and you look around, and at some point, the roots that had been stationary begin to approach you again.
漂浮于这片虚空中的画面碎片逐渐减少，但远远的，你似乎看到一道光源向你慢慢靠近。¤The fragments of images floating in this void gradually diminish, but from a distance you seem to see a light source slowly approaching you.
你重新把手贴在树干上，下一秒，你的眼前又浮现出了那片废墟的画面。¤You reapply your hand to the trunk of the tree and the next moment the image of the ruins comes back to you.
当年仅仅是其中一条根须，便让我与倪兄二人几乎命丧于此，今日若非凭借诛仙剑之能，我多半也只能望而却步。¤Back then, just one of the roots almost killed me and my brother Ni, and if it wasn't for the power of the Immortal Punishing Sword today, I would have been deterred.
画面戛然而止，你猛然将手从树干上抽离，惊出了一身冷汗。¤The scene stops abruptly and you jerk your hand away from the tree trunk in a cold sweat.
若真是天地初生时便诞生的先天灵物，千万年来长成什么样子都不足为奇。¤If they were truly innate spirits born at the dawn of heaven and earth, it is not surprising that they would have grown into anything over millions of years.
恐怖的能量四下翻涌，激起数千丈高的巨浪。而在巨浪之下，你一眼便看到两只体型无比巨大的妖兽正在海面上战斗。¤Terrifying energy surges in all directions, stirring up huge waves thousands of feet high. And beneath the huge waves, you catch a glimpse of two immensely large Spirit Beasts fighting on the surface of the sea.
不可思议...如此奇树，当真是此界能够孕育出来的么？¤Incredible... Can such a strange tree really be bred in this realm?
你将手掌贴在树干上，下一秒，你的识海一阵轰鸣，仿佛突然置身于一片废墟之中。¤You press your palm against the trunk of the tree and the next moment, your consciousness roars as if you are suddenly in the middle of a ruin.
你神识修为虽不突出，但全力探查下至少也可以覆盖一小片海域，却仍然无法探查出这古树的全貌。¤Although your soul sense cultivation is not outstanding, you can at least cover a small area of the sea with your full exploration, but you are still unable to detect the whole picture of this ancient tree.
你顺着这些根须一路来到了古树茎干前，有了诛仙剑的庇护，果然一路无事。¤You follow these roots all the way to the ancient stem of the tree, and with the shelter of the Immortal Punishing Sword, the journey is indeed uneventful.
你向那光源的方向眯起眼睛努力看去，模模糊糊的看到了一片宏伟的宫殿，都是你从未见到过的建筑风格。¤You squint your eyes hard in the direction of the light source and see, in a blur, a magnificent palace, all in a style of architecture you have never seen before.
或许是因为诛仙剑的关系，我似乎能够感应到这古树的某种情绪。这种情绪...是厌恶，还是恐惧？¤Perhaps because of the Immortal Punishing Sword, I seemed to be able to sense a certain emotion in this ancient tree. This emotion... Was it disgust, or fear?
我刚刚...似乎看到了一个废墟...有一个实力强大的男子在与其他人战斗。¤I just... Seemed to see a ruin... There was a man of great strength fighting with others.
一道道雷劫带着万钧之势落下，他的灵气护罩却只是微微颤动，片刻之后，反而气势更盛。¤While a thunderbolt fell with the force of ten thousand strokes, his aura shield only trembled slightly, and after a moment, it became more powerful instead.
一道恐怖的能量从天而降，竟将海面直接一劈为二，仿佛是直接划开了空间一般，留下一道深不见底的深沟。¤A terrifying energy descended from the sky, actually splitting the sea directly in two, as if it had cut straight through space, leaving a deep, bottomless trench.
那人...应该就是之前在幻境中被我击败的那个魔修。¤That person... It should be the evil cultivator I defeated in the illusionary realm earlier.
这些...难道是古树的梦境碎片？¤Are these... Could they be fragments of the ancient tree's dream world?
远处，一个身材高大的修士正操控着飞剑上下翻飞，独自一人与数百名修士交战。¤In the distance, a tall cultivator is controlling a flying sword up and down, fighting alone against hundreds of cultivators.
不远处，一块尤为庞大的碎片向你慢慢飘来。¤Not far away, a particularly large piece of debris drifts slowly towards you.
但眼前的庞然大物与其说这是古树的主干，倒不如说，它是由成百上千根粗细不一的根须互相缠绕而成，形成的一个类似于树干的存在。¤But the behemoth before us is not so much the trunk of an ancient tree as it is a trunk-like existence formed by hundreds and thousands of roots of varying thickness twisting around each other.
你沿着主干用神识向海底探去，除了此前在海底肉眼可见的百余条根须外，隐藏于地下竟还有成千上万条感知不到尽头的根须，以此为中心向四面八方延展。¤As you follow the main trunk and use your soul sense to explore the seabed, in addition to the hundred or so roots previously visible to the naked eye at the bottom of the sea, there are thousands more roots hidden underground, extending in all directions with this as their centre.
你正暗自思量，却发现那人仿佛察觉到了什么，忽而转头向你所在的位置望来。¤You are secretly thinking about it when you notice that the man, as if sensing something, suddenly turns his head to look towards where you are.
你离这光源越来越近...忽然，那人仿佛察觉到了什么，微微侧头，然后转身向你看来，正迎上你的视线。¤You are getting closer to this light source... Suddenly, as if sensing something, the man turns his head slightly sideways, then turns towards you and is meeting your gaze.
刚刚看到的这些画面似乎是按着时间的顺序再慢慢往前推移...那接下来的会是...？¤The images I just saw seem to be moving forward in chronological order... So what's next...?
你想要避开，却发现自己动弹不得...两股强横的力量在你身边相撞，脚下的土地与空间都开始碎裂，你也跟着一起坠入虚空之中。¤You try to avoid it, but you find yourself unable to move... Two powerful forces collide around you, and the ground and space beneath your feet begin to shatter, and you fall with them into the void.
与其说是看到了幻象，反而更像是...我进入到了古树的梦境？¤Rather than seeing visions, it was more like... I've entered the dream world of the ancient trees?
你一头扎进了眼前这块巨大的碎片中，又是一阵天旋地转后，你竟来到了一片海域之上。¤You plunge headlong into the huge shard in front of you and, after another spiral of the sky, you are actually on top of a sea.
随着最后一道雷劫劈落，只见一道金光闪过，旋即爆发出骇人的能量，竟将半空中的劫云完全击散，连你附近的空间都出现了一道巨大的裂痕。¤As the last thunderbolt struck down, only a golden light flashed, and then an appalling energy erupted, actually scattering the thundercloud in mid-air completely and causing a huge crack to appear even in the space near you.
这是...劫云？是谁在渡劫？¤This is... A robbery cloud? Who's doing this?
若这些画面都是曾经真实发生过的，那此前看到的那片废墟，或许就是因为那场正魔大战跌入空间裂隙中的古原城。¤If all these images were once real, then the ruins seen earlier might be the ancient original city that fell into the spatial rift because of that battle between good and evil.
其中一只妖兽形似旋龟，但背上还依附着一条巨大的蟒蛇。另一只妖兽体型堪比浪方，却长着巨大的翅膀，能够在空中飞行。¤One of the Spirit Beasts is shaped like a spinning turtle, but also has a huge python attached to its back. The other Spirit Beast is comparable in size to a wave square, but has huge wings and is able to fly through the air.
传说昔日的九州飞升第一人，便是金虹剑派老祖金虹剑仙...刚刚看到的画面，莫非便是金虹剑仙飞升时的情景...¤Legend has it that the first person to ascend in Kyushu in the past was the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal, the ancestor of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect... The image I just saw could be the scene when the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal ascended...
不，不一样。视角是不同的...¤No, it's not the same. Perspective is different...
大大小小的画面碎片从你身旁缓缓飘过，而你在这片虚空中只能勉强控制自己移动的方向。¤Fragments of images, large and small, drift slowly past you, and you can only barely control the direction in which you move in this void.
这些画面碎片有大有小...到底代表着什么呢？¤These fragments of images are large and small... What exactly do they represent?
你从未见过如此恐怖的海兽，若与他们相比，如今无尽之海上盛名的四大妖圣，简直不值一提。¤You have never seen such terrifying sea beasts. If compared to them, the four famous Demon Saints on the Endless Sea today are nothing to write home about.
那魔修虽被数百名修士围攻，却全然未处于下风，反而收放自如的操纵着四柄魔剑，将那些人一一斩杀。¤The evil cultivator was surrounded by hundreds of cultivators, but he was not at a disadvantage at all. Instead, he freely manipulated his four demon swords and killed them one by one.
别愣着了，快走！¤Don't stand still, move!
天空之上，乌云密布，雷声轰鸣，与师兄白帝渡劫时的情景相差无二。而你正处于半空之中，俯视着下方。¤Above the sky, dark clouds and thunder roar, a scene not unlike that of your elder brother, the White Emperor, during his tribulation. And you are in mid-air, looking down.
玄武与鲲鹏仍在视若无睹的大战，而两侧的海水则源源不断的涌入这道深沟，连你也被一起卷入，重新回到了那片虚空之中。¤Black Tortoise and Kunpeng are still fighting as if they were blind, while the waters on either side are pouring in a steady stream into this deep trench, even you are swept along with them, back into that void.
有了上一次的经历，这次你没有惊慌，而是任由自己在这片空间中飘荡。¤After your last experience, this time you do not panic, but allow yourself to drift through this space.
万年前的正魔大战，二十余万年前的金虹剑仙飞升，还有仅存于神话中的上古神兽...¤The battle between the good and the evil ten thousand years ago, the ascension of the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal more than 200,000 years ago, and the ancient divine beasts that only exist in mythology...
你向劫云的中心方向望去，只见一人独自于山峰之上盘腿而坐。不出所料，此人也正是刚刚在幻境中对你出手的金虹剑派修士。¤You look towards the centre of the cloud and see a man sitting cross-legged alone on the mountain peak. Unsurprisingly, this is the same Golden Rainbow Sword Sect cultivator who just attacked you in the illusion.
轰!!!{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Boom!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
这画面只是短短的出现了一瞬，随着你下意识的将手从树干上抽离，便又立刻消失了。¤The image only appears for a brief moment, and disappears immediately again as you subconsciously pull your hand away from the trunk of the tree.
又是幻象么？太冒险了，看来诛仙剑也无法完全...¤Is it another illusion? It's too risky. It seems that even the Immortal Punishing Sword cannot be fully...
一个熟悉的画面碎片突然出现在你眼前，你努力的往那个方向飘去。一阵天旋地转后，你又来到了一个新的场景。¤A fragment of a familiar image suddenly appears in front of you and you struggle to drift in that direction. After a whirlwind, you are in a new scene.
凭你如今的神识，全力探查下几乎可以覆盖小半片图南海，却仍然无法探查出这古树的全貌。¤With your soul sense nowadays, you can cover almost half of the Tu Nanhai with your full exploration, but you still can't detect the whole picture of this ancient tree.
这和刚刚攻击我的幻象有什么关联么...？¤Does this have anything to do with the vision that just attacked me...?
{shidi}的修为又精进不少，但出手却能做到张弛有度，真是难能可贵。¤{shidi}'s cultivation base has improved a lot, but he is very relax while doing so, which is really commendable.
台下前来挑战的众人见状，竟再无一人敢打你主意...¤When the people who came to challenge you on the stage saw this, no one dared to hit you again...
此战你虽然赢得了一个好口碑，但上台挑战者也是络绎不绝...¤Although you won a good reputation in this battle, challengers on stage are also in an endless stream...
对手才不过炼气初期，法术也用的不太巧妙，根本不是你一招之敌。你故意收了几分力，没有让他输得太过难看。¤The opponent is only in the early stage of refining qi, and the spells are not very clever, and it is not your enemy of a move. You deliberately collected a few points, and you did not make him lose too ugly.
前辈，此时正值本门招新之时，晚辈就先去忙了。\n\t¤Seniors, at this time is the time of our sect recruiting new, the junior will go first busy. \n\t
对手才不过炼气初期，法术也用的不太巧妙，根本不是你一招之敌。你随便捏了一个法决，就将他击出了场外。¤The opponent is only in the early stage of refining qi, and the spells are not very clever. It is not your enemy of one move. You just squeezed a magic trick and knocked him out of the field.
不错，{shidi}有没有兴趣上台守个擂，给大家露两手？¤Yes, is {shidi} interested in going on stage and showing off to everyone?
师兄，门派又在招收外门弟子啦？¤Brother, the school is recruiting outside disciples again?
你走上擂台，对手是一个看起来年不过二十的少年人，正紧张兮兮地看着你。这场守擂的测试，你决定...¤You walk into the ring, and your opponent is a young man who looks less than 20 years old, who is looking at you nervously. In this defensive test, you decide...
{shidi}修为又进步了，临战实力在外门之中已是翘楚，下一次的宗门大比上说不定可以大放异彩。¤The cultivation base of {shidi} has improved again, and the strength in the battle is already a leader among the outer sects, and the next sect competition might be able to shine.
师兄，此时正值本门招新之时，小弟事务繁多，就先去忙了。\n\t¤Senior brother, at this time when the door is recruiting new, I have a lot of business, so I will go to work first. \n\t
今年来参加入门比试的新人真是差劲，连一个通过的人都没有。¤The newcomers who participated in the introductory competition this year are really bad, not even one passed.
你在擂台上的表现引起了李青麟的注意...¤Your performance in the ring attracted Li Qinglin's attention...
不对，还得再等等。¤No, it has to wait a little longer.
御剑回楼逢阔少，同寻魔剑入南崖。欲知后事如何，且听下回分解。¤The sword back to the building to meet the young, with the search for the magic sword into the South Cliff. To know what happens afterwards, and listen to the next decomposition.
那我们这便出发去南崖城吧。¤Then let's leave for South Cliff City.
时间紧迫，{FirstName}{xiongdi}莫要耽搁太久。¤Time is short, {FirstName}{xiongdi}don't delay too long.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}可是准备好灵石了？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}But are you ready for the spirit stones?
你将碎星商会幸存者及之后的事一一向倪旭欣说明。然后你们就幸存者浑浑噩噩的状态做出简单的讨论，不出意外的倪旭欣更加坚信漩涡中有一把魔剑，而这幸存者就是煞气入体才会如此。只是不知为何不似宁州古迹中人一般，会四处伤人。¤You will shattered star Merchant Guild survivors and what happened afterwards to Ni XuXin explained. Then you made a brief discussion on the survivor's muddled state, and not surprisingly Ni XuXin became more convinced that there was a magic sword in the vortex, and that the survivor was the brake into the body to be so. Just somehow not like the Ning Province monuments in general, will be around to hurt people.
等{FirstName}{xiongdi}准备好再来找我吧。¤When {FirstName}{xiongdi} is ready to come back to me.
不急不急。¤No rush, no rush.
不过，师父的魂体怎会虚弱至此？¤However, how could Master's soul be so weak?
嗯...现在的诛仙剑，看起来只是一件普通的纯阳法宝，没有了魔剑的气息。应该是从那古树上得了好处。¤Well... Now the Immortal Punishing Sword looks like just an ordinary pure Yang magic treasure, without the aura of a magic sword. It should have gotten the benefit from that ancient tree.
正是。当年我刚得到诛仙剑时，它还是一把满是锈渍的铁剑，之后也是吸收了大量的魔气和煞气才完成进阶。¤Exactly. When I first got the Immortal Punishing Sword, it was still an iron sword full of rust stains, after which it also absorbed a lot of demonic and fatal Qi to complete the progression.
所以它是在师父与古树战斗后才蜕变至此么？¤So did it metamorphose to this point after Master fought the ancient tree?
你将海底发生的事向白帝一一说明。¤You will explain to the White Emperor one by one what happened at the bottom of the sea.
你是说，师父寄居的这把剑，竟是诛仙剑？¤You are saying that the sword that Master hosts is actually the Immortal Punishing Sword?
那古树作为道的化身，实力自不用说。没想到这诛仙剑竟能对之使用吞噬神通。这么一来，我没有认出诛仙剑，也就说得通了。¤That ancient tree as the incarnation of the Dao, the strength of the self need not say. I didn't expect the sword to be able to use the devouring magic power on it. In this way, it makes sense that I did not recognize the Immortal Punishing Sword.
是的，而且在我把诛仙剑从古树上拔出来后，后者用一记鞭击将我和倪兄击飞，直接送出了海底。¤Yes, and after I pulled the Immortal Punishing Sword out of the ancient tree, the latter used a whip strike to send Brother Ni and I flying and straight out to the bottom of the sea.
师父的魂体非常虚弱，但没什么大碍，在剑中静养慢慢恢复即可。¤The Master's soul is very weak, but nothing serious, and he will recover slowly by resting in the sword.
{$shidi}还有什么要问的么？¤{$shidi} Anything else you want to ask?
天魔眼内危机重重，你与同门子弟应相互守望。¤There are crises in the eyes of the demon, you and your fellow students should watch each other.
剑派锋锐，冰派灵动，雾派迅敏，虽同为水却各有特点。¤The sword school is sharp, the ice school is smart, and the fog school is quick and sensitive. Although they are both water, they have their own characteristics.
{shixiong}且看。¤{shixiong} and look.
哈哈，{shixiong}果真慧眼如炬！将地魔逼至如此地步，我等胜利在望了！¤Haha, {shixiong} really has a discerning eye! Forcing the Earth Demon to such an extent, we are now on the verge of victory!
远处游荡着的魔物也和外围遇到的下等魔不太一样...看来这里大家所说的{color=#d0380a}中心区域{/color}吧。¤The monsters wandering in the distance are also different from the inferior monsters encountered on the periphery... It seems that what everyone is talking about here is the {color=#d0380a}central area{/color}.
你顺着他指示的方向看去，只见刀光剑影中一只赤红魔物破阵而出，各大宗弟子联手围攻却效果甚微。¤If you look in the direction he directed, you can see a crimson monster bursting out of the shadow of the sword, but the siege of the major disciples has little effect.
{shixiong}有所不知，试炼之地魔物有强弱之分，往届众人屠戮的即是{shixiong}外围所见的下等魔。而正中合各宗之力共同应对的乃是地魔，实力仅次于最强的天魔。¤{shixiong} did not know that the monsters in the trial land were divided into strengths and weaknesses. The inferior monsters seen outside {shixiong} were slaughtered by the people in the past. And the power of the central and the various sects jointly dealt with the earth monsters. The strength is second only to the strongest demon.
你连施法术，配合{$shidi}偷袭地魔。地魔腹部的巨口被数道法术击中，发出了痛苦的哀嚎。¤You even cast spells and cooperated with {$shidi} to sneak attack on the demons. The huge mouth in the abdomen of the demons was hit by several spells and wailed in pain.
尚未，{shixiong}好提议，待你我合力试上一试如何？¤Not yet, {shixiong} good suggestion, how about you and I try it together?
转眼间只见又有数名弟子被地魔所伤，你摇了摇头，决定不再多想，便祭出法器加入了战局。¤In a blink of an eye, I saw that several more disciples were injured by the earth demons. You shook your head, decided not to think too much, then sacrificed magical artifacts and joined the battle.
我在外围从未见过这般魔物，这......¤I have never seen such a monster in the periphery, this...
也怪这些弟子年轻气盛，毕竟有能力到达中心地区的都是门派精锐。原本计划击败地魔后再一齐向更深处行进，没想到低估了这地魔的实力......¤I also blame these disciples for being young and energetic. After all, those who have the ability to reach the central area are elites of the sect. The original plan was to defeat the demons and then march deeper together, but I did not expect to underestimate the strength of the demons...
......{$shidi}，你们可否尝试攻击地魔胸腹间的那张巨口？¤...{$shidi}, can you try to attack the huge mouth between the chest and abdomen of the Demon?
你连施法术，配合{$shidi}偷袭地魔。地魔的独眼正巧被一道法术击中，发出了痛苦的哀嚎。¤You even cast spells and cooperate with {$shidi} to sneak attack on the Earth Demon. The one eye of the Earth Demon happened to be hit by a spell and wailed in pain.
得手了！我们乘胜追击！¤Successful! Let's chase after victory!
不如我来替{$shidi}吸引它的注意，师兄趁机攻击！¤It's better for me to attract its attention for {$shidi}, brother took the opportunity to attack!
你看得眼睛酸胀，也没能从中获得什么有用讯息，只觉此魔物难以攻破。¤Your eyes were sore and swollen, and you didn't get any useful information from it. You just feel that this monster is difficult to break.
闻言你屏息认真地观察着地魔，希望能通过之前的经验来推测它的{color=#d0380a}弱点{/color}。¤Hearing that you are observing the Earth Demon with bated breath, hoping to infer its {color=#d0380a}weakness{/color} through previous experience.
不曾，想来宗门长老未曾料到我等竟敢在这天魔眼中同地魔交手便未告知。¤No, I thought that the elder of the sect had never expected that I would dare to fight with the earth demon in the eyes of this demon, but didn't tell me.
话音未落一位同门{$shidi}扑上前来，将你撞向一旁。凌厉的攻击落在你方才站立之地，地面应声而裂。¤The voice did not fall. A fellow {$shidi} rushed forward and slammed you aside. The fierce attack fell on the place where you just stood, and the ground cracked.
应该没有，我也曾考虑到这点。但地魔狡猾得很，我几次偷袭都没能得手。¤It shouldn't be. I thought about it. But the demons are so cunning that I haven't succeeded in several sneak attacks.
你踏入此地后不久，便开始感到强烈的不适...充斥着整个空间的魔气仿佛有意识般朝着你的方向蜂拥而上。¤Shortly after you stepped into this place, you began to feel intense discomfort... The magic that filled the entire space seemed to swarm in your direction as if consciously.
长老可曾传授如何战胜地魔？¤Have the elders taught how to fight against demons?
多谢{$shidi}，此地发生了何事？¤Thank you {$shidi}, what happened here?
前方灵气混乱，且伴随兵戈碰撞之声，定是有人激战。你加快脚步想上前一探究竟。¤The aura ahead is chaotic, and with the sound of clashing soldiers, there must be a fierce battle. You speed up and want to go forward and find out.
{shixiong}小心！¤{shixiong}Be careful!
咦？外围的低阶魔物额头上有眼睛吗？¤Huh? Do the low-level monsters outside have eyes on their foreheads?
天机大比？¤The Tianji Grand Competition?
主阁乃是阁主所在重地，若无允许，道友还是勿要接近为好。¤The main pavilion is where the pavilion master is important, without permission, you should not approach.
由于天机大比在今年举行，天机阁又重新变得热闹了起来。只见一道遁光从天机阁主阁内疾驰而出，向你飞来。¤Since the Tianji Grand Competition was held this year, the Heavens Secrets Pavilion became lively again. Only to see a transported light sped out from the main pavilion of Heavens Secrets Pavilion and flew towards you.
供奉¤Guest Elder
只见一道遁光从天机阁主阁内疾驰而出，向你飞来，你能明显感受到此人境界之不俗。¤You can clearly feel that this person is of a very high level.
即便是放眼整个宁州，元婴期修士也是屈指可数的存在，天机阁自然不会不知道。¤Even if you look at the entire Ning Province, the YuanYing stage cultivator is also a handful of existence, the Heavens Secrets Pavilion naturally will not be unaware.
无妨，道友若改变主意了，可自行前往报名处安排座次，在下便不叨扰了。¤No matter, if you change your mind, you can go to the registration office and arrange for a seat by yourself, I will not bother you.
这边请吧。¤This way, please.
而今日的天机阁，却是人声鼎沸，热闹非凡。¤And today's Heavens Secrets Pavilion, but the crowd is boisterous and lively.
既然如此，在下就不叨扰了。二位若对大比有兴趣，前往接引阁安排座次便是。¤In that case, I will not harass you. If you two are interested in the Grand Tournament, just go to the Receiving Pavilion and arrange your seats.
不过你既然已是化神修为，早已了却了凡性，这三千繁华，你自然是毫不关心。¤But since you are already at the cultivation level of a Deity Transformation and have long since lost your mortal nature, this three thousand prosperity is naturally of no concern to you.
你对状况尚未完全了解，倪旭欣便拉着你一路走到了接引阁。¤You have not yet fully understood the situation, Ni XuXin pulled you all the way to the receiving pavilion.
这是自然，我们走吧。¤This is natural, let's go.
拍卖会每十年举行一次，每届都会有不同的奇珍异宝出现，引得大量金丹期以上修士前来参加。¤The auction is held every ten years, and each session will have different exotic treasures appear, attracting a large number of cultivators above the Jindan stage to attend.
呵呵，任何修士但凡能结丹成功，天机阁都不会收不到消息。¤Oh, any cultivator but can form a successful dan, the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion will not receive no news.
我只是刚好游历至此，随便逛逛而已，就不劳道友费心了。¤I just happen to be traveling here, just strolling around, so I don't need to bother you.
正是…敢问阁下是？¤Exactly...may I ask who you are?
想必阁主是想多些时间准备渡劫之事吧。¤I guess the pavilion master wants more time to prepare for the tribulation.
在下的确是第一次来此。¤It is indeed the first time for me to come here.
呵呵呵，道友年纪轻轻便已结丹成功，天机阁若想不知道反倒是难事。¤The first thing you should do is to get a good idea of what you're doing.
你从天上御剑飞过，俯瞰着这一切，心里却毫无波澜。¤You fly from the sky with your sword, looking down on all this, but there are no ripples in your heart.
我自己随便逛逛就好了。¤I just strolled around on my own.
刚落脚，你便听到一个熟悉的声音在不远处响起。¤Just after landing on your feet, you hear a familiar voice ringing out not far away.
这机缘究竟为何物？¤What exactly is this chance?
这个，等道友夺得魁首时，自然便会知晓。¤This, when you won the leader, you will naturally know.
只见一道遁光从天机阁主阁内疾驰而出，向你飞来。¤Only to see a transported light from the main pavilion of Heavens Secrets Pavilion sped out and flew towards you.
{FirstName}道友，想不到这一次相见，在下倒要叫你一声前辈了。¤{I can't believe that I have to call you a senior after this meeting.
在下虽已拜访过此处，但对天机大比还未有太多了解。¤I have visited this place, but I don't know much about the Tianji Competition.
每届大比也都会有成千上万的炼气、筑基修士前来观赛，以求在高手对战时能启发思绪。¤Every year, thousands of qi refining and foundation cultivators come to watch the competition, in order to inspire thoughts during the battle of the masters.
突破化神后，不管寿元如何，都只有千年时间准备迎接天劫了。¤After breaking through the Deity Transformation, no matter how long you live, you only have a thousand years to prepare for the heavenly tribulation.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}！我就知道你会来！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}! I knew you would come!
而大比给出的机缘，便与此有关。¤And the chance given by the great competition is related to this.
阁主那若隐若现的笑再次一闪而过。¤The looming smile of the pavilion master flashed once again.
在下正有此意。¤I have this intention.
那在下便为道友简要介绍一二吧。¤Then I will briefly introduce a couple of for you.
在下是天机阁执事，方才观道友独自站在原地，想来是遇到了些麻烦，特地前来指引一二。¤I am a deacon of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion, and just now, I observed that Daoist was standing alone in the same place, so I thought that he had encountered some trouble, and I came here to guide him for a moment.
岂止是知道，前辈名讳，在下已是久仰了。¤I am not only aware of the name of the senior, I have long admired.
呵呵，此事不说也罢。只是不知阁下今日来此所为何事？¤Oh, it's okay not to talk about this matter. I just don't know what you came here today for?
从大门外的旅店至接引阁前的空地，都布满了三五成群的散修，或是统一穿着宗门道袍、成群结队的弟子们。天上也偶有遁光闪过，引得众人侧目。¤From the inn outside the main gate to the open space in front of the Attraction Pavilion, there were groups of independent cultivators, or disciples in groups wearing the sect's daoist robes. The sky also occasionally flashed with transported light, attracting the eyes of the crowd.
竟连各大掌门都来参赛？¤How could even the major sects come to the competition?
天机阁坐落于群山之间，平日里少有人烟。只有每隔十年举办一次的拍卖大会，才得以吸引一批高阶修士来到此地。¤Heavens Secrets Pavilion is located between the mountains and is rarely crowded on weekdays. Only the auction meeting held every ten years, only to attract a group of high-ranking cultivators to this place.
正是…阁下知道我？¤Exactly...Your Excellency knows me?
呵呵，像道友这么杰出的人才，与倪家少主相识倒也在情理之中。二位，且随我来罢。¤The first thing you need to do is to get to know the young master of the Ni family. The two of you, and follow me to come.
接引执事¤Deacon of recpetion
此前都没有机会前来观战，今日倒想来看看。¤I didn't have the opportunity to come and watch the battle before, but today I would like to come and see.
此事，你们自行安排便是。¤This matter, you can arrange it yourselves.
承蒙阁主的机缘，有幸突破到化神罢了。阁主只需像以前那般称呼便可。¤I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to break through to the Deity Transformation. You only need to call it like before.
不远处，一阵熟悉的声音传来，打断了那位执事的话。¤Not far away, a familiar voice came, interrupting that deacon's words.
前辈今日能前来观战，顿使我阁蓬荜生辉。只是不知前辈欲在何处观战？¤Senior can come to watch the battle today, my pavilion is full of glory. I just don't know where you want to watch the battle?
说罢，他便飞至前方为你引路。你虽然心生疑惑，但还是跟着他一路飞到了接引阁前。¤After that, he flew to the front to guide you. Although you have doubts, but still followed him all the way to the front of the receiving pavilion.
{FirstName}前辈，幸会。在下天机阁阁主范杰。¤{FirstName}Senior, nice to meet you. I am the owner of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion, Fan Jie.
阁下过谦了，能突破到化神之人根本寥寥无几。在下便止步于瓶颈不知多少年了。¤Your Excellency is too modest, there are only a few people who can break through to the Deity Transformation. I have stopped at the bottleneck for many years.
{FirstName}道友，此次前来可是为了参加天机大比？¤{FirstName}Daoist, is this visit for the Tianji Grand Competition?
那在下便先行告退了。¤Then I will leave first.
那便好说了。¤That's good to know.
非也，纵然位至掌门，号令一方修士的存在，若无法突破化神，恐怕也只能沦为笑柄而已。¤The actual fact is, even if you're in the position of the head of the sect, the existence of the commanding party of cultivators, if you can't break through the Deity Transformation, I'm afraid you can only be reduced to a laughing stock.
天机阁还是往年的景象，但此时的你却不可同日而语。¤The Heavens Secrets Pavilion is still the same scene as in previous years, but at this time you are not the same day.
各路金丹、元婴高手都会前来参赛，甚至贵为五大派的掌门也不例外。¤JinDan and YuanYing experts from all walks of life will come to participate, even the noble five sects of the headmaster is no exception.
你转头望去，只见倪旭欣高呼着向你跑来。¤You turn your head to look, only to see Ni XuXin running towards you with a high cry.
幸会…道友知道我？¤Pleased to meet you...do you know me?
只见地面上布满了三五成群的散修，或是统一穿着宗门道袍、成群结队的弟子们。偶有遁光闪过，引得众人侧目。¤Just see the ground covered with groups of independent Cultivators, or disciples uniformly wearing the sect's daoist robes and in groups. Occasionally, there were flashes of evanescent light, attracting the sideways glances of the people.
敢问道友可是第一次来天机阁？¤Dare I ask if this is the first time you come to Heavens Secrets Pavilion?
无妨，若道友之后想参加天机大比，到接引阁报名即可。¤It does not matter, if you want to participate in the Tianji Grand Competition afterwards, you can register at the receiving pavilion.
天机阁内分为拍卖会、天衍阁、接引阁与主阁。¤The Heavens Secrets Pavilion is divided into the auction, the Tian Yan Pavilion, the receiving pavilion and the main pavilion.
前辈放心，我阁自会安排妥当，前辈明日只管前来观战便是。¤Senior don't worry, my pavilion will arrange it properly, senior just come and watch the battle tomorrow.
好，道友这边请。¤Okay, this way please.
只见一道遁光从天机阁主阁内疾驰而出，向你飞来。你能明显感受到此人境界之不俗。¤Only to see a transported light from the main pavilion of Heavens Secrets Pavilion sped out and flew towards you. You can clearly feel the person's realm of not bad.
座次？¤Seat?
从大门外的旅店至接引阁前的空地，都布满了三五成群的散修，或是统一穿着宗门道袍、成群结队的弟子们。天上也常有高阶修士飞过，引得众人侧目。¤From the inn outside the main gate to the open space in front of the Attraction Pavilion, it was filled with groups of independent cultivators or disciples in groups uniformly wearing the sect's daoist robes. The sky is also often flown by high-ranking cultivators, attracting the eyes of the crowd.
承蒙阁主的照顾，侥幸突破到化神罢了。阁主只需像以前那般称呼便可。¤Thanks to the care of the pavilion master, it was a fluke breakthrough to Deity Transformation. The pavilion master only needs to be addressed as before.
倪少¤Ni Shao
道友这边请。¤This way, please.
此时前来，自然是想借大比观摩一二。¤This time, naturally, I want to take advantage of the big competition to observe a couple of.
没错。道友以为，对五大派掌门这等大能来说最重要的是什么？¤That's right. Fellow Daoist, what do you think is the most important thing to a great power like the five sect heads?
莫非…是与宗门有关？¤Could it be... that it is related to the sects?
阁下今日能前来观战，我阁必是夹道欢迎。此事我阁自会安排妥当，阁下明日只管前来观战便是。¤Your Excellency can come to watch the battle today, my pavilion will be sandwiched to welcome you. This matter will be arranged by my pavilion, you can just come to watch the battle tomorrow.
阁下过谦了，就算有此机缘，能突破到化神之人也是寥寥无几。在下便止步于瓶颈不知多少年了。¤You are too modest, even with this opportunity, there are only a few people who can break through to the Deity Transformation. I stopped at the bottleneck for many years.
而这接引阁便是天机大比安排座次之所在了。¤This is the place where the Heaven's Guiding Pavilion will be arranged for the Great Competition.
这{color=#d0380a}天机大比{/color}，乃是每百年才有一次、全宁州规模最大的赛事。¤The {color=#d0380a}Tianji Grand Competition{/color} is the largest tournament in Ning Province, which only happens once every hundred years.
一段柔和的青年音将你从思绪中拉了出来，只见身旁一位穿着天机阁服饰的修士正微笑地看着你。¤A soft youthful voice pulls you out of your thoughts, only to see a cultivator wearing the costume of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion beside you, looking at you with a smile.
的确有此打算，不过在下却想先四处逛逛。¤I do intend to do so, but I would like to stroll around first.
一时间，你被这纷繁的景象所吸引，竟是愣在了原地。¤For a while, you are attracted by this stirring scene and actually froze in place.
莫非…是与化神有关？¤Could it be... that it has to do with the Deity Transformation?
不错，纵然位至掌门，修仙界登峰造极般的存在，若无法突破化神，终究也只会化为尘土而已。¤The first thing you need to do is to get to the top of the world, and if you can't break through to Deity Transformation, you'll just turn into dust.
道友先凑齐十万灵石，去接引阁处报名即可。¤The first thing you need to do is to gather 100,000 spirit stones and sign up at the attraction.
只是不知，前辈此次前来所为何事？¤I just don't know, what is the reason for senior's visit this time?
道友这边请吧。¤This way, please.
原来是{FirstName}道友，想必也是来参加这天机大比？¤So it's {FirstName} fellow daoist, I guess you're also here to participate in this heavenly machine competition?
转头望去，只见倪旭欣高呼着向你跑来。¤Turning your head to look, you only see Ni XuXin running towards you with a high cry.
倪兄…¤Brother Ni...
只见他略显深意地笑了笑。¤Just see him slightly deep smile.
敢问道友，可是来参加这天机大比？¤Dare I ask you, is it to participate in this heavenly machine competition?
所以他们才能放下身份，只为来寻觅这一丝化神的希望。¤That's why they were able to put down their identities just to come and seek this glimmer of hope of Deity Transformation.
天衍阁主要负责情报收集与交易，道友若想寻得某物，都可以委托天衍阁收集相关情报。¤The Heavenly Diffraction Pavilion is mainly responsible for intelligence collection and trading, if you want to find something, you can entrust the Heavenly Diffraction Pavilion to collect relevant information.
若道友真想知道其中玄机，大可以先观摩一番，不知道友意下如何？¤If you really want to know the mystery, you can observe it first, I wonder what you think?
天机大比马上就要开始了，天机阁又重新变得热闹了起来。¤The Tianji Grand Competition is about to start, and the Heavens Secrets Pavilion has become lively again.
啧，天星城的林公子，上次英杰会名动武陵城的翘楚。凭着神识功法击败了所有男性，又靠相貌倾倒了所有女性……唉，败得透彻。¤Tsk, Young Master Lin of Star City, was the winner of the last Young Hero's Tournament. He defeated all of the men with his skills, and enchanted all of the women with his looks... Alas, it was a complete defeat.
英杰会五年一次，据说是由宁州四族中的倪家操持，连仙家宗派都会派人观礼。这对我们这些小辈而言可是出人头地的好机会，可也是最惨烈的决斗场……¤The Young Hero's Tournament is held once every five years and is said to be run by the Ni family, one of the four clans in Ning Province, even the immortal sects will send people to attend the ceremony. This is a good opportunity for us juniors to make a name for ourselves, but duels in the arena is quite fierce ......
等我领悟这“八极崩”，便要去武陵城的英杰会上闯一闯。上次吃了那林家公子的亏，这次的筑基丹一定是我的！¤After I fully master this Eight Extremes Destruction skill, I will go to the Young Hero's Tournament in Wuling City to prove myself. I suffered defeat at the hands of the Lin clan's young master last time, this time the Foundation Pill must be mine!
困在炼气期的千千万万，真正筑基的却少之又少，就难在突破这一关上。筑基丹能减少突破难度，而拔得英杰会头筹者便奖一颗如此珍贵的仙丹，明白竞争的激烈吧？¤Millions of cultivators spend their life trapped in Qi Refinement, very few manage to breakthrough to Foundation Establishment. However, a Foundation Pill can reduce the difficulty of a breakthrough, and the winner of this tournament will be rewarded one of these precious Pills. Do you understand how fierce the competition is now?
不过炼制六品灵舟可能需要花费我数月时间，待我炼制完成后，会将灵舟用传音符寄回给你。¤But refining the sixth-grade spirit boat may take me several months. When I finish refining it, I will send the spirit boat back to you with a voice transmission talisman.
炼制六品灵舟需要花费我数月时间，待我炼制完成后，会将灵舟用传音符寄回给你。¤Refining the sixth grade spirit boat will take me several months, when I finish refining it, I will send the spirit boat back to you with a voice transmission talisman.
不错，这种材料的确可以用来炼制六品灵舟。¤Not bad, this kind of material can indeed be used to refine a sixth grade spirit boat.
{FirstName}道友可是找到了能用来炼制灵舟的{color=#d0380a}六品木属性材料{/color}？¤{The first thing that I want to know is that you have found the {color=#d0380a} sixth-grade wood-attribute material {/color} that can be used to refine the spirit boat?}
我还是去白帝楼汇报一下吧。¤I'd better go to White Emperor House to report.
你筑基在即，这筑基丹你就收下吧。¤Your breakthrough to Foundation is imminent, take this Foundation Pill.
我击杀偷袭于我的魔门败类，何罪之有？况且待我毁尸灭迹，谁又知道这里发生过什么，又如何咬定是我杀人？¤I killed the scum that sneaked on me. What is the crime? Besides, when I destroy the body, who knows what happened here, and how can I bet that I am the murderer?
我看到的不多，不过你魔门的手段我倒是没错过。同门一场，你束手就擒吧。¤I don't see much, but I haven't missed your magic tricks. If you are in the same game, you can catch it with your hands.
多谢师兄救命之恩。¤Thank you brother for your life-saving grace.
你杀了我，定会有人追查到你的。¤You kill me, someone will track you down.
墨师弟，一念之差沦落此地，实是难看至极。¤Junior Brother Mo, it's really ugly to fall here.
唉......机关算尽反误性命，我跟你走吧。¤Oh... the agency has lost its life, I'll go with you.
{shidi}心性纯善，却颇显冲动。墨居仁虽然阳寿亏空，实力也不容小觑。望{shidi}日后勿要鲁莽如斯。¤{shidi} has a pure and kind heart, but he is quite impulsive. Although Mo Juren has a short life, his strength should not be underestimated. I hope {shidi} will not be reckless in the future.
明明是你这叛徒投靠魔道偷袭于我，现在还想扭曲黑白。¤Obviously you are a traitor who took refuge in the magic way and attacked me, and now I want to twist black and white.
炎萧......？你何时到的？¤Yan Xiao...? When did you arrive?
炎萧只是淡淡的看着墨居仁，眼中尽是冷意¤Yan Xiao just looked at Mo Juren faintly, his eyes were full of coldness
师兄教诲，晚辈定铭记在心。¤I am sure I will take to heart your teachings.
......炎萧，你何时到的。¤...Yan Xiao, when did you arrive.
师兄还是放弃抵抗，随我去见宗门长老吧。¤Senior brother, give up the resistance, let me go to see the elder of the sect.
事关重大，你切莫声张打草惊蛇，不过门派的奖励可少不了你的。¤It's a matter of great importance. You shouldn't be arrogant, but the rewards of the martial art are indispensable to you.
这些丹药你且拿去疗伤。¤Take these pills to heal your wounds.
“惨了，先拖拖时间，再想办法喊来驻守此地的金丹长老。”¤It's miserable, delay the time first, and then find a way to call the elder Jin Dan who is stationed here.
事关重大，你切莫声张打草惊蛇。¤It's a matter of great importance. You mustn't be stunned.
沿着丹香寻去，只见一尊三足六面的大鼎悬在蓝色地火之上，大鼎上方环绕着七彩云雾，四周还布满了晦涩的阵法。¤Along the Dan incense search, only to see a three-legged six-sided tripod hanging above the blue earth fire, the tripod surrounded by seven-colored clouds above, and surrounded by obscure formations.
但区区一颗丹药，怎可能如愿？你一把便将那丹药吸入掌中，细细端详了起来。¤But a mere Pill, how can it be as desired? You a hand will be the Pill sucked into the palm, carefully examined up.
“这难道便是传说中的化劫丹？不愧是六品丹药，竟然都初具灵格了。”¤Is this the legendary Pill of Transformation? It is worthy of the sixth grade Pill, surprisingly all have the first spirit frame.
“这丹房真当是声势浩大，也不知道丹炉里藏着什么宝贝。”¤This dan room is really loud and powerful, and I don't know what treasures are hidden in the dan furnace.
白狐¤White Fox
一股浓郁的丹香飘来。¤A strong fragrance of dan wafted in.
你隔空将炉盖打开，一颗浑圆的七彩丹药夺目而出，大有想要逃走的架势。¤You open the lid of the furnace across the air, and a round, seven-colored Pill comes out, with the intention of escaping.
你又搜寻了一通，但所见都是些寻常丹药，对你已经全然无用。¤You searched again, but all you saw were ordinary pills that were no longer all that useful to you.
普通的丹药都卖这么贵，太黑了吧！¤Ordinary pills are so expensive, it's too dark!
嫌贵啊？药到用时方恨少，一颗救你一条命！¤Too expensive? When the medicine is used, I will hate less, and one will save your life!
二位最近刚刚出关吧，这位也算是个名人了，以伪灵根之身通过擂台加入宗门。¤The two of you just recently came out of the gate, right? This one is also a celebrity, joining the sect through the ring with a pseudo-spiritual root body.
看开始了。¤Look at the beginning.
这是哪位师兄，未有耳闻啊，竟能战胜端木师兄。¤Which brother this is, I haven't heard of it, who can defeat Senior Brother Duanmu.
请{FirstName}\r{LastName}上台比试！¤Please {FirstName}\r{LastName} come to the stage to compete!
对啊，虽然与林师姐相比略逊一筹，但也是成名已久的外门弟子，传闻端木师兄为了这次大比刻意压制了修为。¤Yes, although she is a bit inferior to Senior Sister Lin, she is also a long-established outer disciple. It is rumored that Senior Brother Duanmu deliberately suppressed his cultivation level for this competition.
你干净利落地赢下了第一轮比试的胜利，只要再赢一场，就能拿到所有炼气期修士梦寐以求的筑基丹了。¤You won the first round of the competition cleanly. As long as you win one more round, you will be able to get the Foundation Pill that all the Qi-refinement cultivators dream of.
那倒是厉害了，上一次做到的应该是几百年前的事了吧。¤That's amazing. The last time I did it was probably hundreds of years ago.
怪不得，此人出手之凌厉，连端木师兄都败下阵来。¤No wonder, this person was so fierce that even Senior Brother Duanmu was defeated.
唉，看来我还是太过急躁了，现在的我难以再大比中取得好成绩。¤Oh, it seems that I'm still too impatient. Now I can't get better results anymore.
{FirstName}\r{LastName}对阵温杰！¤{FirstName}\r{LastName} vs. Wen Jie!
请指教。¤Please advise.
他对上“竹剑”温杰了，我竹山宗少有的剑修一脉的传人啊。¤He is facing Bamboo Sword Wen Jie, a rare descendant of Jian Xiu from the Bamboo Mountain Sect.
背后传来一名男子的声音，你转头望去，正是上次那个被称作大长老的男人。¤A man's voice comes from behind you, and you turn your head to look at the man who was last called the Grand Elder.
这与我无关。话已带到，你若不愿去，也随你。¤It's none of my business. The word is out. If you don't want to go, that's up to you.
离火门的这件悬赏应该早就完成了，为何过了那么久才回来？¤This bounty from the Heavenly Fire Gate should have been completed a long time ago, so why did it take so long to return?
最近没有发现{$TmpStrValue}的下落...这些事不必特意来问我，直接用传音符联系密探即可。¤I haven't found the whereabouts of {$TmpStrValue} recently... You don't have to ask me specifically about these things, just contact the spies directly with a summons.
有些实力，能完成这个悬赏，你很不错...¤Some strength to complete this bounty, you're good...
还有什么问题？¤What else is wrong?
那就好。收下吧，这些是你的赏金。¤That's fine. Take it, these are your bounty.
要领悬赏的话，自己看吧。¤To claim your reward, see for yourself.
她抬头看了你一眼，似乎有些惊讶。¤She looks up at you and seems a little surprised.
另外...凭你在风雨楼内完成的悬赏，已经足以晋升为天字杀手。¤Besides... With the bounty you have completed within the Storm Tower, you are already enough to be promoted to Heavenly Assassin.
琚运琦作为上一任风雨楼大长老，对我们的情报系统极为熟悉，所以我恐怕很难提供给你有效的信息。¤Ju Yunqi, as the last Grand Elder of the Rain or Shine House, is extremely familiar with our intelligence system, so I'm afraid it would be difficult for me to provide you with valid information.
玄女，他叫什么名字？¤Xuan Niu, what is his name?
收下吧，这些是你的赏金。¤Take it, these are your bounty.
不过据我猜测，他继续留在宁州的可能性极低，反倒可能已经逃往海外的碎星岛，或是南崖城一带。¤However, according to my guess, it is extremely unlikely that he will remain in Ning Province, and instead he may have fled overseas to the Shattered Star Island, or to the area of South Cliff City.
大长老...有特殊的悬赏任务要交予你，他在密室等你。¤The Grand Elder... has a special bounty to hand over to you, and he is waiting for you in the secret room.
{$daihao}...很好，我记住这个名字了。¤{$daihao}... Very good, I remember the name.
玄女叫住了你，不知为何，你觉得今日的她似乎与平时有些不一样...¤Xuan Nui calls out to you, and for some reason you feel that today she seems a little different from her usual...
{$daihao}...这些是你的赏金。¤{$daihao}... These are your bounty.
只是发生了一些意外，现在都已经摆平了。¤There were just a few mishaps and they have all been set right now.
最近一次发现{$TmpStrValue}的踪迹是在{$place}..这些事不必特意来问我，直接用传音符联系密探即可。¤The last sighting of {$TmpStrValue} was in {$place}... You don't have to come to me specifically to ask me these things, just contact the spies directly with a summons.
说完，他便转身离去了。¤Having said that, he turned and left.
大长老已经在密室恭候多时了，他应该有些事要与你说。¤The Grand Elder has been waiting for you in the secret room for a long time, and he should have something to say to you.
这位客官想要看些什么，要不要小的帮忙介绍一下？本店的东西绝对会让所有客人满意而归！¤This customer wants to see something, do you want me to help introduce it? Our store will definitely make all customers satisfied!
托你收集的草药你可带来了？¤Did you bring the herbs you collected?
我们中草阁愿意以{$jiangli}的价格收购这批草药。¤Our Zhongcaoge is willing to purchase these herbs at the price of {$jiangli}.
这件事就交给我吧。¤Leave this to me.
客官，您...您这边请。¤Guest officer, you... please here.
可惜，可惜....¤It's a pity, a pity...
我是要购置一些宝物，不过我只要你们这儿最好的东西，那些次品就不要拿出来给我看了！¤I want to buy some treasures, but I only want the best things from you, don't show me the defective ones!
很好。¤well.
客官，您说笑了，我们这里卖的可都是上品，您看看便知。¤Guest, you laughed, but we sell all top grades here, you can see if you look at it.
眼下我们的库存的确略有不足，特别是{$taskdesc}¤At the moment our inventory is indeed slightly insufficient, especially {$taskdesc}
我们近日货存充足，没有什么需要补充的草药。¤We have ample stock recently, and there are no herbal replenishments.
你一边说着，一边将自己的灵力外放，那管事感受到你的气势，知道自己遇到的是一位大主顾，脸上的笑容也越发真切了。¤While you are talking, you are releasing your spiritual power. The steward feels your aura, knowing that he has met a major customer, and the smile on his face has become more real.
我现在没有时间收集这些。¤I don't have time to collect these now.
你一边说着，一边挥手将自己的灵石展示给他看，那管事知道自己遇到的是一位大主顾，脸上的笑容也越发真切了。¤While you were talking, you waved your hand to show him your spirit stone. The steward knew that he had met a major customer, and the smile on his face became more real.
不错，不错，这些灵石是给你的报酬。¤Yes, yes, these spirit stones are rewards for you.
臭{xiaozi}，我能记得什么？¤Smelly {xiaozi}, what can I remember?
呼~~老头，你知道她什么路数吗？¤Huh~~Old man, do you know her way?
不过这路数，必是魔门无疑。还出现在武陵城内，你还是回报白帝楼为好。¤However, this number must be the magic door. It still appears in Wuling City. You should pay back the Baidi Tower.
好...好身手...多谢小友手下留情了。¤Good ... Good... Thank you for your mercy.
不过，这运气之法看似平常，与五行剑法相匹配居然如此精妙...果然是前代能人才有的手笔...没想到我修炼一生的竹山剑法，竟有这样的渊源...真是令人感叹哪。¤However, while this method of Qi manipulation seems ordinary,it is remarkably compatible with the Five Elements Sword Technique... It's really the work of a master from a previous generation... I never thought that the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique that I had trained all my life would have such an origin... What a surprise.
{$TmpTalkString}，这个我还没什么头绪，你还是问问旁人吧。¤{$TmpTalkString}, I don't have a clue about this yet, maybe you should ask someone else.
这竹山剑法和离火剑法，均是罕有人用，相对门内其他地阶神通，甚是鸡肋，早已无人问津。¤Both the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique and the Heavenly Fire Sword Technique are rarely used, compared to the other earth-ranked divine abilities in their sect, they are comparatively useless, so no one has bothered with them for ages.
可现在当我运转此功法之后，再运转竹山剑法和离火剑法，却有大不相同之感，莫非是有什么关联？道友若有头绪，记得与我分享一二。¤But now when I run this technique, and then run the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique and the Heavenly Fire Sword Technique, I have a very different feeling, could it be that there is some connection? If you have a clue, please share it with me.
不过后来行走天下，我特地请教了离火剑法，希望从五行生克中提升剑法的威力，但效果并不理想。再加上灵根和火道的原因，我也未能完全掌握。¤However, in my later travels, I specifically learned the Heavenly Fire sword technique, hoping to enhance the power of the sword technique from the interaction of elements, but the results were mediocre. Coupled with my Qi roots and the fire dao, I was not able to fully master it.
温杰不断地比划着各种剑招，十分投入的样子，你看他终于要歇下来了，赶紧上前攀谈。¤Wen Jie kept gesticulating various sword strokes with great devotion, and when you saw that he was finally about to take a break, you hurried up and climbed in to talk.
你问我有什么收获？这个么，谈不上收获，只能说叫猜想。¤What results did I get? Well I can't really call it results, its more of a hypothesis.
可当我运转竹山剑法和离火剑法之时，此功法竟有了许多妙用，我猜莫非是有什么关联？¤But when I run the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique and the Heavenly Fire Sword Technique, this technique had some interesting effects, so I guess there could be some connection?
还是别打扰他了，不过他刚才说的，运功后竹山剑法和离火剑法搭配使用会有特殊反应，倒是有趣。可以找竹山和离火的剑修请教一下。¤It is better not to disturb him, but what he said just now, that the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique and the Heavenly Fire Sword Technique will have a special reaction when used together, is interesting. I can ask the Bamboo Mountain and Heavenly Fire sword cultivators for advice.
我竹山剑法大成之后，便感觉此剑法与竹山诸法门有格格不入之感，不像是竹山宗土生土长的功法，其中颇有几分金鸿剑派古技的韵味。¤After I had achieved perfection with the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique, I felt that this sword technique was out of place in the Bamboo Mountain disciplines and did not resemble a technique native to the Bamboo Mountain Sect. However, it did have a hint of ancient sword sects in it.
温杰不断地比划着各种剑招，全身心投入，显然正在专心领悟。¤Wen Jie kept gesturing at various sword moves, fully engaged and clearly concentrating on comprehension.
{$TmpTalkString}你来啦，经文一定也看过了吧，真是玄妙非常。¤{$TmpTalkString}Ah, you're here, you must have read the scriptures, truly mysterious.
有意思，竹山剑法、离火剑法...你可得好好记下这点，我想说不定是解谜的关键。¤Interesting. The Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique, the Heavenly Fire Sword Technique... You'll have to make a note of that, I think it might be the key to solving the puzzle.
温杰不断地比划着各种剑招，十分投入的样子，不过一看到你来了，立马停下来向你打招呼。¤Wen Jie is constantly gesticulating various sword strokes and is very involved, but as soon as he sees you coming, he immediately stops to greet you.
可我看你在这里已经领悟了好久了。¤But I see that you have been comprehending here for quite some time.
惭愧，我竹山宗本就不善剑法，只是我个人爱剑罢了。领悟起来肯定不如那边的各大剑派的弟子们。¤I am ashamed to say that the Bamboo Mountain sect was never good with swords, its just a personal hobby of mine. When it comes to comprehension I am no match for the disciples of the sword sects over there.
{$TmpTalkString}能够传承五行剑诀之道统，真是令在下佩服！有机会一定要好好论一论道！¤{$TmpTalkString} I admire you for passing on the Dao of the Five Elements Sword Art! When there's a chance, I'd really like to discuss Dao with you!
我深感此法与竹山法门惯用法门不符，后来行走天下，特地请教了离火剑法，希望从五行生克中提升剑法的威力，结果自然是并不理想。再加上灵根和火道的原因，也未能完全掌握。¤I deeply felt that this method was not in line with the usual techniques used by the Bamboo Mountain Sect. Later, when I travelled the world, I specifically learned the Heavenly Fire Sword Technique, hoping to enhance the power of the sword technique from the interaction of elements, but naturally the result were mediocre.  Coupled with my Qi roots and the fire dao, I was unable to fully master it.
下面开始本届英杰会决赛的比试，公孙公子，请上台。¤The next contest for the final of this year's Heroes will begin, Gongsun Gongzi, please come on stage.
道友去{color=#d0380a}逸风城宝器轩{/color}看看吧，那边法器不少，可以去挑几件趁手的。¤You can go to {color=#d0380a}Treasure Weapon Xuan{/color} in Yifeng City to have a look, there are many magic weapons there, so you can go and pick a few that you can use.
道友可知，修士们大都同时运转一门主修功法和数门辅修功法？因为只有这样才能发挥最大的战斗能力。¤Do you know that most cultivators run one main cultivation technique and several secondary cultivation techniques at the same time? This is because only in this way can they make the most of their combat abilities.
才三回合不到，壮汉便贴身直入，一拳把对手击飞了出去，那名修士\r在地上挣扎了几下，便不省人事，而那壮汉甚至连灵力护罩都没破损。¤It took less than three rounds for the strong man to close in and send his opponent flying with a single punch. The cultivator \r struggled on the ground for a few moments before he became unconscious, while the strong man didn't even break his spiritual shield.
那修士狼狈地站稳，羞愧地讪笑着，深施一礼，灰头土脸地离场了。伴随着观众\r的狂欢声与喝彩声，升仙台管事恭敬地将筑基丹奉上。¤The cultivator stood up in disarray, smiled shamefacedly, gave a deep salute and left the stage in disgrace. Accompanied by the wild cheers and applause of the audience\r, the steward of the Ascension Stage respectfully presented the Foundation Establishment Pill.
在众人兴奋的呐喊声中，最后一场很快就到了...¤With the crowd chanting with excitement, the final game soon arrived...
一阵香风飘过，只见一名清秀少女轻轻落在台上，一双明眸好奇地打\r\n量着对手。¤A fragrant breeze wafted past, only to see a young, fresh young girl landing gently on the stage, her bright eyes curiously beating \r \n measuring her opponent.
说着百里奇翻身一跃下台，眨眼之间便到数丈之外，施展几下遁术便\r\n远远不见了。¤The first thing you need to do is to take a leap off the stage, and in the blink of an eye you will be several feet away, performing a few evasive techniques and then \r\n far away.
阵修，有意思...你得设法结交一二，以后说不定有什么用处。¤Formation cultivators, interesting... You have to try to make friends with one or two, you might have some use for them later.
终于，凌厉的剑气将对面的护盾击个粉碎，对面避无可避，只得认输。\r倪旭欣点到为止，瞬间将全部剑气散去。¤Finally, the harsh Sword Qi shattered the shield of the opposite side, which could not be avoided and had to admit defeat. \r Ni XuXin nailed it, instantly dispersing all the Sword Qi.
林沐心在观众的称赞声中，深施一礼，在林家家仆的护送下飘然离去。¤Amidst the praises of the audience, Lin MuXin gave a deep salute and floated away under the escort of the Lin family servants.
攻守同样重要，道友战斗时若能身着护具，想必能增添不少胜算。¤If you can wear protective gear when fighting, you will be able to increase your chances of winning.
是啊，不过之前听说林家二小姐活泼贪玩，没想到竟有如此战力？看来以后遇到\r神识强大的修士，可真是要慎之又慎！¤Yes, but I heard before that the Lin family's second young lady was lively and playful, but I didn't think she would have such battle prowess? It seems that in the future, if you encounter cultivators with strong \r soul sense, you really have to be careful!
这位道友，您先请吧！¤After you, fellow Daoist!
这小鬼，挺有气势，看这体格，应该修炼过什么炼体的秘术...¤This kid is very powerful, looking at this physique, what secret technique should be practiced...
会场气氛瞬间安静了一秒，紧接着便爆发出排山倒海般的喝彩声。\r升仙台管事恭恭敬敬地将筑基丹奉上。¤The atmosphere in the venue was instantly quiet for a second, followed by an outburst of applause like a mountain of cheers. The steward of the \r Ascension Stage respectfully presented the Foundation Establishment Pill.
有意思..好好准备，有机会去{color=#d0380a}百里府{/color}看看，是你的机缘也说不定。¤Interesting... Prepare well and visit {color=#d0380a}Bailey House{/color} sometime, it may be your chance.
等等，道友你上台作战，居然只运转一部功法，还只练到一层？¤Wait a minute, fellow Daoist, you went up to the stage to fight and actually ran only one technique, and you only practiced to the first level?
若有哪位道友能战胜我，或是让我百里奇战个痛快，我便愿把这筑基\r丹亲手奉上！在下在广陵城百里府随时欢迎切磋，恭候诸位挑战！¤If any of you can defeat me or give me the pleasure of fighting, I'll give you this Foundation Establishment \r Pill myself! I am always welcome to fight at the Baili Mansion in Guangling City, and I await your challenge!
下面开始本届英杰会决赛的比试，请刚刚晋级的倪旭欣选手上台！¤Let’s start the competition in the finals of this year’s Elite Club. Please come on stage, Ni XuXin, who has just been promoted!
英杰会管事定睛观瞧，显得有些惊诧。¤The steward of the Yingjie Society looked a little surprised as he fixed his eyes on it.
去{color=#d0380a}天星城问道楼{/color}逛逛吧，那边的功法神通是物美价廉，好好参悟突破，才能在修仙界有一战之力。¤Go to {color=#d0380a}The Heavenly Star City Asking for the Way Building{/color} for a stroll. The gong methods and divine abilities there are good value for money, so enlighten yourself and break through to have a fighting chance in the immortal cultivation world.
公孙季向观众们拱了拱手，向管事施了一礼，将筑基丹收入囊中。随后纸扇轻摇，微微一笑，向兴奋的观众们徐徐说道。¤Gong Sun Ji arched his hand to the audience, gave a salute to the steward, and took the Foundation Establishment Pill into his pocket. He then flicked his paper fan, smiled faintly and spoke slowly to the excited audience.
下面开始本届英杰会决赛的比试，请刚刚晋级的林沐心选手上台！¤Let's start the final competition of this year's Ingenious Basterds, and invite the recently promoted Lin MuXin to the stage!
对面也是丝毫不和倪旭欣客气，口吐灵气，手掐剑诀，御剑直攻而来。\r两位剑修顿时缠斗在一起，闪转腾挪间，难辨人影，只见剑光。¤The other side is also not the least bit polite with Ni XuXin, mouth spitting aura, hand clenching sword trick, imperial sword straight attack and come. \r The two sword cultivators immediately entangled in a fight, dodging and moving around, it was difficult to distinguish the silhouette of a person, only to see the sword light.
一位豪爽的大汉纵身越上擂台，只见他身长九尺，壮硕至极，站在台\r\n上的气势，好像山岳一般，令人胆寒。¤A big, bold man crossed the ring, only to see that he was nine feet long and stout as hell, standing on the stage \r \n an imposing manner, like a mountain, which was frightening.
我观道友你战斗时两手空空，行走仙途，怎能没有一器傍身哪？你背上背着一把铁剑，为何不拿来御敌呢？¤I see you fighting with empty hands. How can you walk the path of immortality without a weapon? You are carrying an iron sword on your back, why don't you use it to defend yourself against the enemy?
对了，道友是散修吧，不入宗门虽然逍遥，但是在求仙之路上可谓是举步维艰，若要想轻松容易一些，还得去{color=#d0380a}五大宗门{/color}拜拜\r山门，碰碰运气。¤By the way, you are a independent cultivator, right? Although you are free from joining the clan, you can have a difficult time on the road to immortality. If you want to make it easier and easier, you have to go to the {color=#d0380a}five major clans{/color} to pay a visit to the \r mountain gate and try your luck.
倪道友向着众人兴奋地挥着手，在倪家家仆的簇拥下，潇洒下台而去。¤Daoist Ni waved his hand excitedly at the crowd and, flanked by the Ni family servants, dashed off the stage.
姑娘轻盈灵敏，对手投来的各种法术神通，都被她笑嘻嘻地逐\r一化解。而对手则眉头紧锁，牙关紧咬，似乎正奋力抵抗着什么。¤The girl was light and agile, and the various spells and divine powers thrown by her opponent were all smilingly defused \r by \r. Her opponent, on the other hand, was frowning and clenching his teeth, as if he was struggling to resist something.
下面开始本届英杰会决赛的比试，请刚刚晋级的百里奇选手上台！¤Let’s start the competition in the finals of this year’s Heroes, please come to the stage for the newly promoted Bailiqi players!
在下公孙季，我云汐城与公孙家如今正广纳贤才，若有青年才\r俊，随时可来我云汐城之中寻找机缘。¤My name is Gongsun Ji, and the Gongsun family is now looking for talented young people, so if you have any young talent, you can come to our city at any time to find your chance.
这筑基丹，我其实无意争夺，我只是想与同阶强者切磋罢了。¤This Foundation Establishment Pill, I actually have no intention of fighting for it, I just want to spar with a strong person of the same rank.
不过修为的差距是很难弥补的，希望你能勤奋修炼，提升修为境界，期待修为精进后道友你的表现。¤However, the gap in cultivation is difficult to bridge. I hope you can cultivate diligently and raise your cultivation level, and I look forward to seeing how you will perform when your cultivation level is refined.
白袍公子一收折扇，向对方拱手施礼，举手投足儒雅至极，仙风道骨\r。对面嘿嘿一笑，二话不说便掐诀施法，御器直攻而来。¤The white robed gentleman, who has a folding fan, bowed to his opponent, and raised his hands and feet in an elegant manner, the immortal bones \r. The opposite side of the hedge laughed, without saying a word, and then pinched the trick to cast a spell, the Royal weapon attacked straight away.
不必手下留情，放马过来吧！¤Don't be merciful, let go!
但听一声娇喝，姑娘明眸闪动间，对手修士掐诀施法的身影霎时一顿，\r眼神空洞茫然，直直向地面倒去，昏迷不醒。¤But hear a delicate cry, the girl's bright eyes flashing, the opposing cultivator choking and casting a spell of figure suddenly a stop, \r eyes hollow and blank, straight to the ground, unconscious.
随着几个落石正中身体，那修士顿时失去平衡，直直向地面坠去，只\r见公孙季轻挥纸扇，用灵力将其托举，轻轻扶到地上。¤With several falling stones hitting his body squarely, the cultivator lost his balance and plunged straight towards the ground, only to \r see Gongsun Ji flicking his paper fan and using his spiritual power to lift him up and gently help him to the ground.
对手偷袭不成，反而身陷阵法，躲避不及，不禁冷汗满额，而公孙公子只是淡然地在阵眼位置微笑着，可谓以静制动，以逸待劳。¤The opponent failed to sneak attack, but instead he was caught in the formation, unable to dodge, and could not help but sweat coldly all over his forehead, while Gong Sun Gongzi just smiled bashfully at the eye of the formation, so to speak, waiting for his opponent to take advantage of the situation.
只见公孙公子面不改色，纸扇轻摇之间，各种奇妙的阵法便驱动起来，\r环环相扣，生生不息，精妙无穷。¤The paper fan was flicked and various marvellous formations were driven, \r interlocking, inexhaustible and exquisite.
能够登台直面练气中后期修士，道友实属勇气可嘉。虽为练气初期，\r有这样的心性和勇气，想必将来必有成就。¤You are courageous to be able to face a late Qi refining cultivator on the stage. Even though you are in the early stage of Qi training, you have such a heart and courage, so you will surely achieve something in the future.
精通神识流的姑娘，可真是有趣得很哪，别看咯，咱们走吧。¤A girl who is well versed in the stream of divine knowledge can be very interesting, so stop looking and let's go.
这是...倪道友？！¤This is... Fellow daoist Ni?!
会场的观众们统统高呼过瘾，两位剑修之间的对决，着实是精彩万分，\r升仙台管事恭敬地将筑基丹奉上。¤The spectators in the venue all shouted with delight, the duel between the two sword cultivators was truly exciting,\r the steward of the Ascension Stage respectfully presented the Foundation Establishment Pill.
道友既是宗门弟子，平日里可多去宗门内{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}看看，莫要浪费了大好资源。¤Since you are a disciple of the clan, you may visit the {color=#d0380a}Cache of Scriptures{/color} within the clan during the weekdays, so as not to waste the great resources.
素闻天星城林家二小姐是美貌非常，今日一见果真如此！你看她那双眼睛，\r真是灵动非常！¤I've heard that the Second Miss of the Lin Family in Star City is very beautiful, but today I see that she is! Look at her eyes!
在下公孙季，初次见面，还请道友赐教。¤My name is Gongsun Ji and I am meeting you for the first time, so please enlighten me.
只见一俊朗剑修快步上台，爽朗一笑，负剑而立。随后大方地向着对\r面修士抱拳一礼。¤I saw a handsome sword cultivator quickly step onto the stage, smiling brightly and standing with his sword. He then graciously gave a fist salute to the \r-faced cultivator.
大汉指着对面的修士，毫不客气地说道。¤The big man pointed at the cultivator across the street and said nonchalantly.
你的实力不错，不过到此为止了，在我手上，你撑不过三个回合。¤Your strength is good, but that's it. In my hands, you can't survive three rounds.
等等，道友上台作战，居然只运转一部功法？这样可是要吃大亏的，¤Wait a minute, you're only running one technique when you go up to fight? That's a big loss.
英杰会管事向你迎面走来，轻轻拍了拍刚从擂台下来的你。¤The Yingjie Club steward walks towards you to greet you and gently pats you who has just come down from the ring.
这小子，被关了这么久，倒确实是有点长进，你也要加油啊，别落在后头太远了。¤This kid, after being locked up for so long, has really grown up a bit. You should also work hard, don't fall too far behind.
百里奇接过筑基丹，一手将其托举，向着台下的观众朗声说道。¤Bailiqi took the Foundation Establishment Pill and held it up in one hand as he spoke aloud to the audience on the stage.
英杰会管事定睛观瞧，若有所思。¤The steward of the Ying Jie Society gazed at it, pondering.
林沐心莞尔一笑，向着狂欢着的观众们眨了眨眼，一旁恭候多时的升\r仙台管事恭恭敬敬地将筑基丹奉上。¤Lin MuXin smiled and winked at the rapt audience as the long-awaited steward of the Sheng\r Immortal Stage respectfully presented the Foundation Establishment Pill to the side.
修士战斗皆以修为悟道为根本，功法神通为依仗，法器丹药为助力。\n¤Cultivators fight with cultivation and enlightenment as their foundation, gongfu and divine abilities as their backing, and magic weapons and pills as their assistance. \n
对面脸色一冷，敷衍地拱手\r一礼，二话不说，便与壮汉缠斗起来。¤The other side's face was cold, and he gave a perfunctory arch\r salute, and without saying a word, he tangled with the strong man.
学的再多，却只浅尝辄止可不行，道友要踏实修习，好好精进突破。¤It is not good enough to learn more than you can handle, but you need to be practical in your practice and make a breakthrough.
嘻嘻，承让啦。¤Hee hee, I'm sorry.
期待道友以后的表现，你在台下好好休息便是，在下先失陪了。¤I look forward to your future performance, so just rest up on the stage.
倪道友艺高人胆大，交手之时愈长，剑气反而愈攒愈多，对面从\r开始时凶猛至极的进攻，逐渐转化为狼狈地防守。¤The longer the fight went on, the more Sword Qi was accumulated. The opposite side gradually transformed from a fierce attack at the beginning to a woeful defence.
你身上功法气息繁杂且不醇厚，道友是都只修炼了一层吧。功法还是得要刻苦突破才行，这是是经年累月之功，马虎不得。¤The aura of your gongfu is complicated and not mellow, so you have only cultivated one layer, right? You must still work hard to break through the gongfu, it's a work of years and months, so you can't be sloppy.
胜败乃兵家常事，道友不必沮丧。¤Victory and defeat are commonplace in the military, so there is no need to be dismayed, Fellow Daoist.
这姑娘...炼气期就有这等神识，真是不简单啊，你可要小心了。¤This girl... It's not easy to have this kind of soul sense at the Qi refining stage, so be careful.
如果万事俱备，却还不免失败，这可能是{color=#d0380a}搭配运用{/color}出了问题，可以多多留心，多多思考，必能有所精进。¤If you have everything in place and you are still failing, you may have a problem with the {color=#d0380a} mix and match{/color}, so you can pay more attention to it and think about it more, and you will be able to improve.
沸腾的人群突然安静了下来，只见一身着白袍的俊朗公子，手摇折\r扇，缓步走上台来，面带笑意地看着对方。¤The boisterous crowd suddenly quieted down, only to see a handsome gentleman in white robes, waving a folding \r fan in his hand, slowly walking up to the stage and looking at the other side with a smile on his face.
有意思，有机会去{color=#d0380a}云汐城{/color}游历一二，就是不知道这位公孙公子口中的机缘，究竟是什么，所以还是得小心为妙。¤Interesting, there is a chance to go to {color=#d0380a}Yun Shi City{/color} for a trip or two, I just don't know what the chance this Gongsun Gongzi is talking about, so I still have to be careful.
要感谢的是{$Xing}才对吧。而且，难道{$xing}对我的关心程度远胜于蕊宫仙子和{$Lin}？¤It's {$Xing} to thank. Also, does {$xing} care more about me than Fairy Ruigong and {$Lin}?
虽说你花了些时间破阵，害我看太久鸾儿她们的战斗都觉得无聊了。¤Although it took you some time to break through the formation, it made me feel bored watching Luan'er and the others fighting for too long.
虽说你花了些太多时间破阵，害我看太久鸾儿她们的战斗，都开始考虑要不要亲手解决冲虚散人和那古神教的魔修了。¤Although you spent too much time breaking the formation, I watched Luan'er and the others for too long, and I began to consider whether I should personally solve the evil cultivator of the Chongxu San and the ancient gods.
你选择无视星凝最后说的话，而是提出自己更关心的问题。¤You choose to ignore Xing Ning's last words and ask questions that you care more about.
（我早该想到的，她八成是知道我在场后，又憋了一肚子坏水。）¤(I should have thought that she probably had another stomach full of bad water after knowing that I was there.)
嗯，为何？那若是我不在，蕊宫仙子与{$Lin}此次岂不是都要身死于那绝魂阵中。¤Um, why? If I wasn't there, wouldn't Fairy Ruigong and {$Lin} all die in the Soulless Formation this time.
星凝还未说完，便已是化作一道流光消失在了大殿中。¤Before Xing Ning finished speaking, he turned into a streamer and disappeared into the hall.
即便我不在，就那几位元婴邪修和冲虚散人，凭你化神强者的实力还不是手到擒来？¤Even if I'm not here, just those Nascent Soul Evil cultivators and Chongxu Sanren, can't they be captured by the strength of your Deity Transformation powerhouse?
不，当时我并不在宫中。而且鸾儿也只是向我汇报说冲虚散人私通魔教被她发现，正在追回，而不是向我请求帮助。以鸾儿的实力对付冲虚散人绰绰有余，更何况我还安排心儿前往支援。¤No, I was not in the palace at the time. Moreover, Luan'er just reported to me that she had found out about Chongxu Sanren's illicit sect of magic, and she was chasing it back, instead of asking me for help. Luan'er's strength is more than enough to deal with the Chongxu scattered people, not to mention I also arranged for Xin'er to go to support.
但还好结果没让我失望，尤其是他用那什么“玄骨”唬住你的时候，只有我知道阵法里根本就没有其他人。当时你们认真的表情真是精彩，嘻嘻。¤But fortunately, the result did not disappoint me, especially when he used that profound bone to scare you, only I knew that there was no one else in the formation. At that time, your serious expressions were really wonderful, hee hee.
在{$Xing}眼里，化神之下皆蝼蚁么？¤In the eyes of {$Xing}, are all ants under Deity Transformation?
呃...¤Well...
若不是心儿告诉我你也会一同前往支援，我甚至没打算关注此次事件。¤If it wasn't for Xin'er telling me that you would also come to support me, I didn't even plan to pay attention to this incident.
所以现在想来，冲虚散人多半是故意露的马脚，其实早就与古神教勾结意图陷害我。而我竟一时大意没有多想，险些让鸾儿命丧于此。¤So now that I think about it, most of the Chongxu Sanren were deliberately exposed, but in fact, they colluded with the ancient gods to frame me. And I didn't think much about it for a while, and I almost killed Luan'er here.
这次还真要感谢你呢。¤I really want to thank you this time.
哼，若不是无惑对星宫有功，冲虚散人又是他最喜爱的弟子，此人在我眼中不过蝼蚁而已，敢暗通魔教碾死便是了。所以令鸾儿与心儿将之追回已算得上是关照有加，我又何必再多加关注。¤Hmph, if it wasn't for Wuhuo's contribution to Xinggong, and Chongxu Sanren being his favorite disciple, this person is nothing but an ant in my eyes, and he would have been crushed to death by secretly stalking the Demon Sect. Therefore, having Luan'er and Xin'er recovering him is considered to be very caring, so why should I pay more attention.
啊！差点忘了，我还要去给鸾儿疗伤呢！¤what! I almost forgot, I'm going to heal Luan'er!
哦？你不是说冲虚散人只是蝼蚁嘛，为何我一来你就亲自前往了？¤Oh? Didn't you say that Chongxu Sanren are just ants, why did you go there in person as soon as I came?
自然不是，先不说星宫中人。若不是关注你，此次我又怎会亲自前往。¤Naturally not, let's not talk about the people in the star palace. If I hadn't paid attention to you, how could I have personally visited this time.
（虽然当时确实被她蒙住了，但至少...从结果来看不是坏事吧。）¤(Although it was true that she was blinded at the time, but at least... it's not a bad thing from the results.)
我这不是出于关心么，没想到你不但不感谢竟还质疑，真是浪费我一番好心。¤Didn't I do this out of concern? I didn't expect you to question me instead of thanking me. What a waste of my good intentions.
（怎么总觉得她说的话哪里有矛盾？）¤(Why do you always feel that there is a contradiction in what she said?)
那血剑宫的赤目长老的确是白帝楼所下的悬赏，可惜这次没能拿下他，让他逃回了雍州。¤That Red Eye Elder of the Blood Sword Palace was indeed a bounty placed by the White Emperor's House, but unfortunately he could not be taken down this time, allowing him to escape back to Yongzhou.
琚运琦之事总算是告一段落了...¤The matter of Ju Yunqi has finally come to an end...
但不管怎么说，这次能当场抓住琚运琦的把柄，你也居功至伟，这赏金当有你的一份。¤But in any case, you have been instrumental in catching Ju Yunqi red-handed this time, and you deserve a share of the reward.
接下来的事情先交给你了。我还有些事要与{$daihao}说。¤I'll leave the next thing to you for now. I have something else to say to {$daihao}.
总之，他口中还有许多秘密可挖，活着比死了更有价值。¤In short, there are still many secrets to be mined from his mouth and being alive is more valuable than being dead.
对了，琚运琦有一事倒是没有骗你。¤By the way, Ju Yunqi is not lying to you about one thing.
这次没能留住琚运琦，你准备怎么办？¤What are you going to do if you can't keep Ju Yunqi this time?
我倒是很想看看，曾经的风雨楼大长老，会怎么应对风雨楼的追杀。¤I would love to see how the former Grand Elder of the Storm House would respond to the Storm House's pursuit.
还好...有你帮我。¤Luckily... I have you to help me.
{$TmpTalkString}，我知道你一定有很多问题想要问我...我一定知无不言。¤{$TmpTalkString}, I know you must have a lot of questions for me... I will know everything.
那血剑宫的赤目长老的确是白帝楼所下的悬赏，这次能顺利解决掉他，你居功至伟，赏金理应归你所有。¤That Red Eye Elder of the Blood Sword Palace was indeed a bounty placed by the White Emperor's House. You deserve the credit for successfully solving him this time, and the bounty should go to you.
我此前一直在犹豫是否要将这些秘术传授于你，它们一定会让你的实力大上一个台阶，但若你因为修炼这些秘术而亏损寿元，又实非我愿...¤I have been hesitant to teach you these techniques, as they will definitely bring you to a higher level of strength, but if you lose your life because of practicing them, it is not something I would like...
{$TmpTalkString}不觉得有趣么？¤{$TmpTalkString} don't find it interesting?
只不过，因为体质特殊的原因，玄女并未和其他死士一般修习风雨楼秘术，而是由爷爷另授了一套适合她修炼的法门。¤However, because of her special physique, Xuan Nui did not practice the secret techniques of the Rain and Rain House like other dead soldiers, but was taught a separate set of techniques suitable for her by her grandfather.
无妨。¤No problem.
当年爷爷培养的那批死士中，玄女是年纪最小的。论辈分而言...应该算是琚运琦的小师妹吧。¤Of the group of dead soldiers that Grandpa trained back then, Xuan Nui was the youngest. In terms of seniority... She should be considered Ju Yunqi's junior sister.
{$TmpTalkString}，你的这份情义，我不会忘。¤{$TmpTalkString}, this love of yours, I will not forget.
跑得了一时，跑不了一世。等上了风雨楼的悬赏，他以后的日子可就没那么好过了。¤He can run away for a while, but not for a lifetime. When the bounty from the Rain and Rain Tower is placed on him, his future will not be so easy.
他的这份赏金，也该归你所有。¤This bounty of his should also go to you.
这些秘术是当年望风与听雨二人留下的，它们的厉害之处你也已经领教过了。¤These secret techniques were left behind by the duo of Lookout and Listen to the Rain back in the day, and you have already experienced their power.
说到这里，公孙季仿佛终于松了一口气。¤When he said this, it was as if Gongsun Ji had finally breathed a sigh of relief.
不管怎么说，这件事的决定权应该交给你自己。亏损的寿元的确无法挽回，但这些秘术在关键时刻或许能救你一命也未可知。¤In any case, the decision on this matter should be left to you. It is true that the loss of longevity cannot be recovered, but it is also true that these secret techniques may save your life at a critical moment.
你准备公开悬赏他？¤You're going to put a public bounty on him?
原来如此...所以她会特别关注与血剑宫有关的悬赏吧...¤I see... That's why she pays special attention to the bounties related to the Blood Sword Palace...
另外，这次若非有你在，我们也没这么容易能活捉琚运琦，到时难免要另行悬赏。¤In addition, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't have been able to capture Ju Yunqi alive so easily, and we would have had to offer a separate reward.
这些年来，公孙府内有不少长老被他收买。除此以外，他还有几条暗线专门接取一些特殊的悬赏用以敛财。¤Over the years, many elders in the Gongsun House have been bought by him. In addition to this, he also has several secret lines dedicated to receiving special bounties to enrich himself.
爷爷死后，这批风雨楼死士皆由琚运琦接手。但我曾找了个机会暗示过她，爷爷或是被琚运琦所害，因此她一直保有戒心。¤After the death of my grandfather, Ju Yunqi took over the reins of the Wind and Rain House. But I had a chance to hint to her that her grandfather had been killed by Ju Yunqi, so she was always wary.
当年爷爷遇害之时，我修为尚浅，在风雨楼内也无根基，想扳倒琚运琦实非易事。¤When my grandfather was killed, my cultivation was still shallow and I had no roots in the Rain or Shine House, so it was not easy to take down Ju Yunqi.
道友，要住店么？¤Friends, do you want to stay in this inn ?
让我想想...¤Let me think...
哼，我们走！¤Huh, let's go!
这群禾山道的修士果然难缠，还是想想办法再来吧。¤This group of cultivators on the Heshan Road is really difficult to deal with, so let's find a way to come again.
还是好好提升一番实力，等五年后再来吧。¤It's better to improve your strength, and wait five years before you come.
人外有人，天外有天，让你这{xiaozi}多吃吃教训也好。¤There are people outside the world, there are days outside the sky, let you {xiaozi} eat more and learn more.
这一轮的对手好像只是普通的散修...¤The opponents in this round seem to be just ordinary independent cultivators...
这一轮的对手好像是公孙家的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be the cultivator of the Gongsun family...
恭喜{FirstName}{LastName}选手获得第一轮比试的胜利。¤Congratulations to {FirstName}{LastName} for winning the first round of the competition.
我们稍微调整，马上开始进行第二轮的比试！¤Let's adjust a bit and start the second round of competition right away!
咳咳咳...没想到第一轮就输了...¤Cough cough cough... I didn't expect to lose in the first round...
这一轮的对手好像是百里家的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be a cultivator from the Baili family...
你这{xiaozi}才修炼没几日，要是能赢那才叫奇怪。¤You {xiaozi} only practiced for a few days. It would be weird if you can win.
交易会很快就要开始了，道友请随我来。¤The trade fair will soon begin, so please follow me, Fellow Daoist.
我没什么兴趣。¤I have little interest.
今年除了这拍卖会外，我们天机阁还受人之托，将要举办一场只针对元婴期以上修士的小型交易会，不知道友可有兴趣参加？¤This year, apart from this auction, we at the Heavens Secrets Pavilion have been asked to hold a small trade fair for cultivators at the YuanYing stage and above, I wonder if you would be interested in participating?
小型交易会？¤Smaller fairs?
我们天机阁的拍卖会虽然盛名在外，但还是会有一些道友虽有重宝在身，却不想只用来交换灵石，而是希望能直接兑换到一些自己急需的物品。¤Although our Heavens Secrets Pavilion's auctions are well known, there are still some Daoists who, despite having heavy treasures in their possession, do not want to use them only to exchange for spirit stones, but wish to exchange them directly for some items they urgently need.
道友若有兴致的话，不妨来看一看。¤If you are interested, you may wish to take a look.
像这种小型交易会，只是提供给道友一个以物易物的机会，所以有时甚至能换取到一些平日里在拍卖会上都见不到的稀有物件。¤Small fairs such as this one simply provide an opportunity for Daoists to barter, so sometimes they can even exchange for rare items that you wouldn't normally see at an auction.
道友请留步。¤Please stay, fellow Daoist.
还是凑足灵石再来吧。¤It's better to join in the spirit stone and come again.
我派不擅炼丹，{shixiong}若有需要，可以自行使用炼丹房。¤I'm not good at alchemy. If necessary, {shixiong} can use the alchemy room by himself.
我派不擅炼丹，{shidi}若有需要，可以自行使用炼丹房。¤I am not good at alchemy. {shidi} can use the alchemy room if necessary.
吼~¤Roar~
不错的灵力，这只三目妖狼绝非普通的筑基期妖兽实力，小心应对。¤Not bad spiritual power, this three-eyed monster wolf is definitely not an ordinary monster beast strength in the base-building phase, so be careful.
这位道友，建议你还是去碎星商会问一问吧，他们终日行于海上，应该会知道更多相关情况。¤This daoist friend, I suggest you go to the Shattered Star Merchant Guild to ask, they spend their days on the sea, should know more about the situation.
刚才已经告诉道友了，我们万宝楼对图南海的状况并不熟悉，你还是去碎星商会问问吧。¤Just now have told you, we Wanbao House is not familiar with the situation in the South China Sea, you better go to the Shattered Star Merchant Guild to ask.
不好意思，我们这万宝楼忙着买卖，平时也没什么太多余力关心图南海的太多状况，对岛外之事知之甚少。¤Sorry, we are busy with the sale of this Wanbao House, usually there is not too much extra energy to care about too many conditions in the South China Sea, and know very little about the matters outside the island.
你可以看到，此处不过是一个简单的洞穴。¤As you can see, this is just a simple cave.
这里的下等魔本身没有灵智，但被击溃后体内魔气便会消散，并掉落我们所需的这种{color=#d0380a}灵核{/color}。¤The inferior demons here have no spiritual intelligence themselves, but when they are crushed the demonic energy in their bodies will dissipate and drop this {color=#d0380a} spirit core we need{/color}.
天魔眼本是宁州一处极为富饶的灵脉所在，但不知从何时起，这里竟开始源源不断地产生魔气，并渐渐凝聚为一种奇异的魔物。¤The Heavenly Devil's Eye was originally an extremely rich spiritual vein in Ning Province, but I don't know when it started, but it began to produce a steady stream of demonic energy, and gradually coalesced into a strange demonic object.
青石灵脉位于宁州西部山脉，与衡州接壤。灵脉由各大宗门轮流管理，对所有普通修士开放。¤The Greenstone Spiritual Vein is located in the western mountain range of Ning Province, bordering Hengzhou. The Spiritual Vein is managed by the major clans on a rotational basis and is open to all ordinary cultivators.
不过想要抢占其中比较好的采集点，还需自身实力过硬才行，青石灵脉深处可不乏金丹期甚至元婴期的高手。¤But want to seize one of the better collection points, but also need their own strength is too strong to do, the depths of the lapis lazuli spiritual veins can not be lacking in the jindan stage or even the yuanying stage experts.
{FirstName}长老，宗门现在正在收集灵核用以布阵，你若是有多余的灵核，可以在我这里换取突破境界时需要用到的珍贵丹药与秘术。{w}{w=0.5}¤Elder {FirstName}, the clan is now collecting spirit cores to use in formations, so if you have extra spirit cores, you can exchange them with me for the precious pills and secret techniques you need to use when you break through the realm. {w}{w=0.5}
{FirstName}{shixiong}，宗门现在正在收集灵核用以布阵，你若是有多余的灵核，可以在我这里换取突破境界时需要用到的珍贵丹药与秘术。{w}{w=0.5}¤{FirstName}{shixiong}, the sect is now collecting spirit nuclei to use in the formation, if you have extra spirit nuclei, you can exchange them with me for the precious pills and secret arts that you need to use when you break through the realm. {w}{w=0.5}
白帝楼现在正在收集灵核用以布阵，你若是有多余的灵核，可以在我这里换取突破境界时需要用到的珍贵丹药与秘术。{w}{w=0.5}¤The White Emperor Pavillion is now collecting spirit cores to set up formations, so if you have extra spirit cores, you can exchange them with me for the precious pills and secret techniques you need to break through the realm. {w}{w=0.5}
灵核通常在灵气充沛的{color=#d0380a}洞窟或者矿脉{/color}附近就有机会找到。宁州最大的灵核矿脉便是青石灵脉，大部分的灵核都产自那里。除此以外，{color=#d0380a}天魔眼{/color}中的魔物体内也会凝结这种灵核。¤Spiritual nuclei are usually found near {color=#d0380a} caves or veins {/color} that are rich in spiritual energy. The largest spirit core vein in Ning Province is the Greenstone Spirit Vein, where most of the spirit cores are produced. In addition to this, the magic objects in the {color=#d0380a}Celestial Devil's Eye{/color} also condense this kind of spirit cores.
见过师祖，不知师祖有何吩咐？¤Meet the Master, I wonder what the Master has to say?
如今的天魔眼虽然被各大门派与家族封印，但每过二十年仍需派有筑基期修为的弟子前去清缴。¤Nowadays, although the Heavenly Devil's Eye is sealed by the major sects and families, but every twenty years still need to send disciples with Foundation Establishment cultivation to clear it.
你回去告诉宁王，等这炉丹药炼制完成，按照约定我会给他送去一颗。¤You go back and tell Ning King that when the refining of this pill is completed, I will send him one as agreed.
此人已在府内待满6日，大部分时间都在屋内享受足不出户，想必如今药性也渗透的差不多了吧。¤This person has been in the mansion for 6 days, most of the time in the house to enjoy without leaving the house, presumably now the medicinal properties are almost penetrated.
人带来了么？¤Did anyone bring it?
此人已在府内待满6日，这6日内倒有{$TempValue}日在到处闲逛取乐，想必如今药性也渗透的差不多了吧。¤This person has been in the mansion for 6 days. In these 6 days, {$TempValue} has been wandering around for fun. I think the medicinal properties are almost infiltrated now.
呵呵，看来此时药性已经发作，他这一身修为都被吸收了个干净，待我将他炼成精粉，做这药引子是刚刚好。¤Hehe, it seems that the medicinal properties have already occurred at this time, and his cultivation has been completely absorbed. It is just right for me to refine him into fine powder and make this medicinal primer.
你大惊失色，连忙运足一口灵气，怎想体内灵力一运转起来，便自动消散的无影无踪。¤You were shocked, and quickly took a breath of spiritual energy, how can you think that the spiritual power in your body will automatically dissipate without a trace as soon as the spiritual power in your body is activated.
惊恐之下，还没等你缕清其中原委，便眼前一黑失去了知觉...¤In horror, before you can shed light on the whole story, I lost consciousness in front of my eyes...
许长老，人已经带到了。¤Elder Xu, people have already been brought.
此人已在府内待满6日，这6日内倒有{$TempValue}日在花天酒地，想必如今药性也渗透的差不多了吧。¤This person has been in the mansion for 6 days. In these 6 days, {$TempValue} has been spending a lot of time. I think the medicinal properties are almost infiltrated now.
你随着管事竟一路走到了城外，正当你觉得奇怪是什么任务不能在王府内说，而偏要跑到城外来时，一个低沉的声音传入你的耳朵。¤You went all the way to the outside of the city with the steward. Just when you thought it was strange that you couldn't say something in the palace, but you were about to run outside the city, a low voice came into your ears.
身上的灵石似乎不够了...¤I don't seem to have enough spirit stones on me...
道友，请。¤Friends, please.
地火房租借，一次200灵石。{w}{w=0.5}¤Earth Fire House lease, 200 spirit stones at a time. {w}{w=0.5}
炼器室租借，一次200灵石。{w}{w=0.5}¤The refining room is leased, 200 spirit stones at a time. {w}{w=0.5}
道友，您这钱可不够买下这灵舟的。¤Friends, your money is not enough to buy this spirit boat.
哎？道友，说了这么多，来看看小店的灵舟吧！¤Hey? Fellow Daoist, having said so much, let's take a look at the spirit boat of the shop!
这无尽之海上大抵有着十几片海域，有的海域风平浪静，有的海域波涛诡谲......我哪有那个胆子出海啊，这些都是从那些归来的修士那打听来的。¤This endless sea has more than a dozen sea areas. Some sea areas are calm and some sea areas are treacherous... How can I have the courage to go out to sea? These are all inquiries from the returning cultivators.
紫衫舟的售价是1440灵石，道友确定要这艘灵舟吗？¤The price of the zishan boat is 1440 spiritual stones. Are you sure you want this spiritual boat?
沉沙舟的售价是30240灵石，道友确定要这艘灵舟吗？¤The price of the sand sinking boat is 30,240 spirit stones. Are you sure you want this spirit boat?
铁木舟的售价是82944灵石，道友确定要这艘灵舟吗？¤The price of the iron wooden boat is 82,944 spiritual stones. Are you sure you want this spiritual boat?
目前没有前往无尽之海的船只。¤There are currently no ships heading to the Endless Sea.
抱歉，目前可用的灵舟已经全部出租了。¤Sorry, the spirit boats currently available have all been rented out.
听他们说这海上还会遇到风暴乱流，那风浪刮起来，啧啧啧...幸好小店的灵舟坚固耐用，他们才幸免于难。¤I heard them say that there will be storms and turbulence on the sea, and the wind and waves will blow up. Tsk tsk tsk... Fortunately, the small shop's spirit boat is sturdy and durable, and they survived.
本店小本生意，只出售一至四阶的灵舟。五阶灵舟拍卖会上尚可一见，至于六阶灵舟则可遇而不可求，整个宁州怕是也没有几艘。¤Our shop is a small business, and only sells Tier 1 to Tier 4 spirit boats. Tier 5 spirit boats can still be seen at auction. As for Tier 6 spirit boats, they can be encountered but not sought. There are not many in Ning Province.
无尽之海上的海兽修为大多在金丹期之上，实力强劲。故此道友修为若未至金丹且千万小心，已有不少修士不听劝告，落了个舟毁人亡的下场。¤Most of the sea beasts in the endless sea are above the golden core stage, and their strength is strong. Therefore, if you have not reached the golden core, you must be careful. Many cultivators have refused to listen to the advice and have fallen into a boat and destroyed people. The end of the game.
桃木舟的售价是6912灵石，道友确定要这艘灵舟吗？¤The price of the peach wooden boat is 6912 Lingshi, are you sure you want this one?
道友若想前往无尽之海历练，灵舟乃必不可少之物。¤If Taoists want to go to the endless sea to experience, the spirit boat is an indispensable thing.
唉，四阶灵舟损毁一艘少一艘，就算卖给这些人了也不能这么糟蹋呀...¤Oh, one Tier 4 spirit boat is destroyed and one less is lost. Even if it is sold to these people, it can't be such a waste...
这灵舟共分六种品阶，其中一阶灵舟最为常见，成本也最为低廉。因其品质粗劣，故只可在近海航行，若道友想探索远海，最好更换品阶更高的灵舟。¤This spirit boat is divided into six grades, of which Tier 1 is the most common and the cost is the cheapest. Because of its poor quality, it can only sail offshore. If you want to explore the far sea, you’d better change to a higher grade. The spirit boat.
{FirstName}\r{LastName}上台对阵！¤{FirstName}\r{LastName} is on stage to play against!
接下来你们四人将进行最后的两轮比试，只有最终夺魁者才能够直接晋升为内门弟子，希望你们都能发挥出自己的实力。¤Next, the four of you will have the final two rounds of competition. Only the winner can be directly promoted to the inner disciple. I hope you can all show your strength.
诸位同门，本次宗门大比已决出了前四位弟子，他们也将各自得到门派奖赏的筑基丹一枚。¤Everyone from the same sect, the first four disciples have been decided in this Zongmen Grand Competition, and they will each receive a sect reward of Zhujidan.
承让。¤Concession.
请。¤please.
你顺利地又赢下了第二轮的比试，台下传来一片叫好声。¤You successfully won the second round of the competition, and there was a shout of applause from the audience.
（比起端木林，身为剑修的温杰强的不止一筹。）¤(Compared to Duanmulin, Wen Jie, who is a sword repairer, is more than one.)
哎，没办法，就算对内门弟子来说，筑基丹也是很重要的。¤Ay, there's no helping it, even for the inner disciples, Foundation Pills are precious things.
{FirstName}{shixiong}两战连胜，说不定可以争夺魁首之位。¤{FirstName}{shixiong} won two games in a row, maybe you can compete for the top spot.
XXX对阵墨景山！¤XXX vs. Mo Jingshan!
{FirstName}{shixiong}早就拿过大比魁首了，还来与我们这些外门弟子争夺名额...¤{FirstName}{shixiong} has taken the top leader long ago, and is still competing with us outside disciples for places...
请赐教。¤Please enlighten me.
{shidi}，温杰在外门之中也是有名的强手，你能战胜端木林已是不易，不要太过在意一时的胜负。¤{shidi}, Wen Jie is also a well-known strong player in the outer door. It is not easy for you to defeat Duanmulin. Don't care too much about your temporary victory.
不敢当。¤Don't dare to be.
唉，看来我还是太过急躁了，现在的我难以再大比中取得成绩。¤Oh, it seems that I'm still too impatient. Now I can't get any results in a big match.
（温杰都败了，X师弟此次真的是一鸣惊人了。）¤(Wen Jie is defeated, Junior Brother X is really a blockbuster this time.)
墨师兄，据称闭关研习地阶功法《五毒噬心决》。这一场不知是更强。¤Brother Mo, it is said that the practice of Five Poisons Devouring the Heart was studied in retreat. I don't know if this one is stronger.
连温师兄都不敌此人，看来本次大比倒是又多出一个猛人。¤Even Senior Brother Wen is no match for this person. It seems that there is another fierce man in this competition.
不过，这雷劫只针对渡劫之人。即便他人有心帮忙抵挡，不仅对你没有任何帮助，反而自己会受到雷劫的攻击。¤However, this lightning tribulation is only for those who are crossing the tribulation. Even if others have the intention to help resist it, not only will it not help you in any way, but you will be attacked by the thunderbolt yourself.
{FirstName}供奉，据我龙族前辈记载，人类修士渡劫飞升需经过九道天雷劫，而每一道的威能都会不断提升。¤Guest Elder {FirstName}, according to the records of my predecessors in the dragon clan, human cultivators need to go through nine heavenly thunder tribulations to ascend, and the power of each one will keep increasing.
所以，这九道雷劫只能由{FirstName}供奉自己去面对。是魂飞魄散，还是得道飞升，都看今日了。¤Therefore, these nine thunder tribulations can only be faced by the Guest Elder {FirstName} himself. Whether his soul will be scattered or whether he will attain ascension, it all depends on today.
你把东西都毁了，我以后练什么？难道让我抱着本禾山经练一辈子吗？¤If you destroy everything, what will I practice in the future? Do you want me to hold on to this Wo Shan Sutra for the rest of my life?
听着他不停的叫骂，你内心五味陈杂。¤You have mixed feelings inside as you listen to his incessant shouting and swearing.
无论会不会有无辜凡人因此获救，但麻老九突破的希望毫无疑问又小了一分。你叹了口气，转过身径直离开了。¤Whether or not any innocent mortals will be saved as a result, there is no doubt that Ma Lao Jiu's hopes of breaking through are one point smaller again. You sigh and turn around and leave straight away.
你并没有下死手，只是当着他的面，又使出几发火球将颜老怪的洞府轰了个干净。¤You didn't strike to death, you just made a few more fireballs to blast Old Monster Yan's cave clean in front of him.
抱歉…¤Sorry...
我算是看错你了，你跟那些伪君子根本就是一路货色！¤I was wrong about you, you are the same as those hypocrites!
也好。¤Yep.
葛道友，玄道宗这是发生什么了？¤Ge Daoist, what is happening to the Mystic Dao Sect?
或者，我们也可以尝试联系玄道宗的幸存者，摸清天魔教的底细后再做打算。¤Or, we can also try to contact the survivors of the Mystic Dao Sect and get to the bottom of the Heavenly Demon Cult before making plans.
不必客气。天魔眼事关重大，我想与炎萧道友先行前往打探情况，而葛道友负责通知宁州各大势力。不知两位意下如何？¤No need to be polite. The Heavenly Devil's Eye is a matter of great importance, I want to go with fellow Daoist Yan Xiao to poke around first, while Daoist Ge is responsible for informing the major powers in Ning Province. I wonder what you two think?
对手的焦急你看在眼里，心里更是深知待炎萧解决完所有对手与你夹攻这元婴后期魔修时，胜利便是唾手可得。¤The anxiety of the opponents you see in the eyes, the heart is to know to Yan Xiao to solve all the opponents and you sandwich attack this YuanYing late evil cultivator, victory is within reach.
所幸有{FirstName}{$DaoYou1}与炎萧道友前来相助，不然还不知该当如何是好。¤Fortunately, there {FirstName}{$DaoYou1} and Yan Xiao Daoist friends to help, otherwise I do not know what to do.
这魔修虽说境界高于你，但你有法宝护体，倒也不那么惧他。¤Although this devil cultivator realm is higher than you, but you have magic treasures to protect your body, but not so afraid of him.
但此时的他哪还有上次见面时的谦逊随和。¤But at this time, he has no modest and easy-going as when we met last time.
但这天魔道不知是用何手段，不但令门中传音符尽皆失效，而且宁州其他修士似是没有发现玄道宗的异状一般，十数日过去也未曾前来。¤But this heavenly devil do not know what means, not only make the door of the sound transmission talisman are invalid, and Ning Province other cultivators seem to have not found the Mystic Dao Sect's strange general, more than ten days have not come.
（好！就是现在！）{vpunch=10,0.5}¤(Good! It is now!) {vpunch=10,0.5}
此前路过广陵城时我曾留心观察过，其中修士未曾有什么奇怪的表现，还是和平日一样。魔修应该是奇袭玄道宗，大胜之后封锁了消息，目的应该是天魔眼。我们本应去阻止，但只怕来的元婴修士不少，仅凭你我二人难以应对。¤When I passed by Guangling City, I observed carefully that the cultivators did not show any strange behavior, just as usual. The devil cultivators should have attacked the Mystic Dao Sect and blocked the news after the victory, the purpose should be the Heavenly Demon Eye. We should have gone to stop it, but I'm afraid there are many YuanYing cultivators coming, and it's difficult for you and me to deal with them.
先正面受这一击的魔修陨落于此，近旁的玄道宗大阵甚至是因余波而剧烈颤动起来，远方与炎萧激斗的魔修更是个个都对神通的爆发处侧目，显然是没想到一个炎萧本就十分棘手了，与他同行之人的实力更是难以想象。¤The first frontal hit by the evil cultivator fell here, near the Mystic Dao Zong formation is even due to the aftermath and violent trembling up, far away and Yan Xiao fierce fight with the evil cultivator is each of the outbreak of the Avatar side eye, obviously did not expect a Yan Xiao is very tricky, and the strength of his counterpart is unimaginable.
一旁的炎萧甚至来不及出手，只能在一旁感慨你的强大。¤On the side of Yan Xiao even too late to make a move, can only lament your powerful on the sidelines.
但一月前天魔道大举来犯，我玄道宗一时不敌，只好令剩余弟子躲入护宗大阵中，以求获得宁州其他正道的支援。¤But when the Heavenly Demon Dao attacked in January, the Mystic Dao Sect was overwhelmed and had to send its remaining disciples into hiding in the Great Protection Formation in order to get support from other righteous daoists in Ning Province.
当下玄道宗遭劫，天魔眼状况不明，不如葛道友前往各大势力通知，而我和{FirstName}小友先行前往天魔眼摸清状况吧。¤The Mystic Dao Sect is suffering from a robbery and the condition of the Heavenly Demon Eye is unknown, so why don't Daoist Ge go to the major powers and inform them, while {FirstName} and I will go to the Heavenly Demon Eye first to find out the situation?
你用法宝将飞来的玄紫色神通格开后，趁着那魔修旧招已穷新招未至之时，手掐秘诀，积蓄已久的庞大灵力也随之宣泄而出。¤After you use the magic treasure will fly to the Xuan purple divine pass away, while that devil cultivator old moves have been poor new moves have not arrived, the hand pinch secret, the accumulation of a long time huge spiritual power is also declared out.
但留在玄道宗伏击的魔修才这么几个，恐怕玄道宗现在还有战斗力的修士更少。¤But stay in the Mystic Dao Sect ambush of the evil cultivator only so many, I'm afraid that the Mystic Dao Sect now have less fighting cultivators.
可在你二人强大的实力面前，并不会给他自爆元婴的机会。几乎是同一时间，你的法宝，炎萧的神通一齐贯穿了这魔修的身体，抹去了他的存在。¤But in front of your two powerful strength, and will not give him the opportunity to self-destruct the firstborn. Almost at the same time, your magic treasure, Yan Xiao's divine ability together penetrated the body of this evil cultivator, erasing his existence.
且受伤之处有魔气黏着，反倒是没有血液流出，在旁人看来称得上是诡异。¤And the wounded place has the magic qi sticky, instead of blood flowing, in the view of the onlookers called bizarre.
他惯穿的那身纤尘不染的白色道袍如今下摆已是破败不堪，右肩部分更是少了一大块，露出里面被魔气沾染的伤口。脸上虽看似保持着平静，但眉头间凝结着不甘，眼神中更是蕴含着杀意。¤The immaculate white daoist robe he is used to wearing is now tattered at the hem, and the right shoulder part is missing a large piece, revealing a wound stained by the demonic qi inside. Although the face seems to remain calm, but the brow between the condensed reluctance, the eyes are embedded with killing intent.
对于魔道，宁州各大势力同气连枝，自是我炎萧分内之事。¤For the Devil's Path, Ning Province major forces together, since I Yan Xiao part of the matter.
所幸有炎萧道友携{FirstName}小友前来相助，不然还不知该当如何是好。¤Fortunately, you have Yan Xiao with {FirstName} little friend to help, otherwise I do not know what to do.
你与那魔修斗得个你来我往，由外人看来大有纠缠上数十乃至数百回合之意。但局势并未这么简单而冗长地发展。¤You and the evil cultivator fought a back and forth, by outsiders seem to have the intention of entangling on dozens or even hundreds of rounds. But the situation is not so simple and lengthy development.
正是你此前在玄道宗大殿见过的葛白衣。¤It was Ge Baiyi, whom you had previously met in the Mystic Dao Sect's main hall.
连玄道宗大阵都未能攻破，魔修此行应当是没有化神战力前来。料想魔修的目的也应该是天魔眼，我们这便出发吧。¤The devil cultivator should not have the power of Deity Transformation on this trip. I think the purpose of the evil cultivator should also be the Heavenly Demon Eye, so let's set out.
所幸有{FirstName}{$DaoYou1}携炎萧道友前来相助，不然还不知该当如何是好。¤Fortunately, there {FirstName}{$DaoYou1} with Yan Xiao DaoYou came to help, otherwise I do not know what to do.
还得从上次与{FirstName}{$DaoYou1}见面说起。当时{$DaoYou1}走后，我立即加强天魔眼外驻守的人马，但一直未能发现魔修的相关行踪。久而久之，玄道宗上下又逐渐进入平日的状态。¤I also have to start from the last time I met with {FirstName}{$DaoYou1}. At that time {$DaoYou1} left, I immediately strengthened the people stationed outside the Heavenly Demon Eye, but have not been able to find the relevant traces of evil cultivator. Over time, the Mystic Dao Sect gradually went back to its usual state.
倒是天魔道又攻击大阵几日后，只留下几人埋伏便是离去，只怕是想对天魔眼做些什么。但在下与门中剩余战斗力皆是身负重伤，尝试数次后依旧难以突围。¤On the contrary, after a few days of the Heavenly Demon Road and attacking the big formation, only a few people left in ambush is to leave, only to do something about the Heavenly Demon Eye. But I and the door of the remaining fighting force are heavily wounded, try several times after still difficult to break out.
但你可没闲工夫观察自己的伤口，这魔气侵蚀的可不仅是你的身体，甚至连你的神魂都感觉像是要被一口一口撕咬而后吞噬。¤But you don't have time to observe your wounds, this magic erodes not only your body, but even your soul feels like it's going to be torn apart and eaten up one by one.
好，好快！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Good, so fast! {vpunch=10,0.5}
而那魔修就没这么从容了。¤And that evil cultivator is not so subdued.
不必多礼。天魔眼事关重要，我这就动身前往。¤No need to be polite. The eye of the heavenly devil is important, I will move to go.
估计这玄道宗此前遭了魔修袭击，这才开启护山大阵。而后可能是魔修实力太强，玄道宗修士不敢出大阵一步，只能龟缩在宗门内部。¤It is estimated that the Mystic Dao Sect was previously attacked by evil cultivators, which opened the mountain protection array. And then may be the strength of the evil cultivator is too strong, Mystic Dao Sect cultivators dare not go out of the formation step, can only cower inside the sect.
甚好。¤Very good.
你还未来得及掐法诀驱动法宝和护体神通，已是被血魂煞近身！¤You have not yet had time to pinch the magic to drive the magic treasures and protective magic, is the blood soul fury close to the body!
葛白衣显然是在护宗大阵上打开个口子之前，就已经知道山脚处战后获胜的是你与炎萧二人，见到你们并没有太惊讶。¤Ge Baiyi apparently before opening an opening on the clan protection array, already knew that the winner after the battle at the foot of the mountain is you and Yan Xiao duo, and was not too surprised to see you.
出于对自己实力的自信，你并没有选择这种以拖为主的平淡战斗方式。¤Out of the confidence in their own strength, you did not choose this to drag the main bland fighting style.
不等你再做什么防御手段，只觉身体像是要被撕裂般，已然是布满了魔气留下的凌厉伤口。¤Do not wait for you to do any more defensive means, only to feel like the body is going to be torn apart, is already covered with the lingering wounds left by the magic gas.
那晚辈便前往各大势力通知此事。¤Then the late generation will go to the major powers to inform this matter.
这些个天魔道修士除一个最强的元婴后期还尝试挣扎了一番，其他甚至没来得及释放自己最后的神通便是陨落于此。¤These Heavenly Devil Dao cultivators, except for one of the strongest late YuanYing stage still tried to struggle, the other did not even have time to release their last divine ability is fallen here.
没问题。¤No problem.
没事吧？¤Is it okay?
此前路过广陵城时我曾留心观察过，其中修士未曾有什么奇怪的表现，还是和平日一样。魔修应该是奇袭玄道宗，大胜之后封锁了消息，目的应该是天魔眼。不管他们的目的为何，我们都可以去尝试阻止他们。只是前来的元婴魔修应是不少，有些棘手。¤Previously, when passing through Guangling City, I have carefully observed, the cultivators did not have any strange behavior, or the same as usual. The devil cultivators should have attacked the Mystic Dao Sect by surprise and blocked the news after the victory, and the purpose should be the Heavenly Demon Eye. No matter what their purpose is, we can go and try to stop them. It's just that there should be a lot of YuanYing devil cultivators coming, which is a bit tricky.
先不说你现在体内灵气被那侵入的魔气搅得紊乱不堪，神魂上的剧痛更是让你险些晕过去，完全没有抵抗的能力。只能在听到魔修的暴喝后，勉强抬头看一眼。¤First of all, not to mention that your body aura is now the invasion of the devil stirred up disorderly, the soul of the pain is so close to fainting, completely without the ability to resist. Only after hearing the devil cultivator's violent drink, barely looking up.
一边是自己面对一个金丹修士还久攻不下，另一边是炎萧对战一个元婴初期和数个金丹后期如入无人之境，两相影响之下这元婴后期魔修出手看似是越来越狠厉，但每每被你防下攻击时，心中是越来越焦急。¤On the one hand, they are facing a jindan cultivator also long attack, the other side is Yan Xiao against a YuanYing early stage and several jindan late stage as into no man's land, under the influence of the two phases this YuanYing late stage evil cultivator strikes seem to be more and more ruthless, but every time you defend the attack, the heart is more and more anxious.
（遭了，这妖人比我想象的要棘手太多了！）¤(Damn, this demon is much trickier than I thought!)
眼见那魔修的攻势一波快过一波，一波强过一波，你开始手忙脚乱了起来。有时甚至刚防住一个强力神通又是一道玄堇色魔气与你擦身而过，其裹挟的劲风都已是令你护体灵气溃散，乃至身体被擦伤。¤Seeing that the evil cultivator's attack wave is faster than a wave, a wave is stronger than a wave, you start to get your hands dirty. Sometimes even just prevent a powerful Avatar and a xuan cordial-colored demonic Qi and you brush, the wind is already causing your body aura collapse, and even body was bruised.
血魂煞！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Blood Soul Fury! {vpunch=10,0.5}
他虽然能隐隐感觉到炎萧状态并不太好，可从另一边传来的战斗余波来看，这火属性修士的战斗力绝对是碾压了一众天魔道修士！\n以至于那狂暴的火灵气都在这片小空间中占据了主导地位，让他心头的焦急更盛！¤Although he can vaguely feel Yan Xiao state is not very good, but from the other side of the battle aftermath, this fire attribute cultivator's combat power is absolutely crushed a group of heavenly devil path cultivators! \n so much so that the raging fire aura are dominating in this small space, making his heart's anxiety even more!
但...¤But...
饶是这魔修已经在燃烧自身精血与神魂来提升战斗力，却也不过在你手下坚持数息时间。而另一名魔修虽说是果断，乃至是坚决地抛弃了同门，但在这极短的时间内也不过也未能远离你，更不用说逃出你的攻击范围了。¤Spare this evil cultivator is already burning its own blood and soul to enhance combat power, but also only under you to last a few breaths of time. And although the other evil cultivator was decisive and even determined to abandon his fellow disciples, but in this very short period of time also failed to get away from you, let alone escape from your attack range.
造成这一边倒局势的，不是元婴修士与化神修士的差距，而是元婴修士与你的差距！¤What caused this lopsided situation was not the gap between the YuanYing cultivators and the Deity Transformation cultivators, but the gap between the YuanYing cultivators and you!
但入眼的却是一片火光。¤But into the eyes is a fire.
在你加入后，不过一个照面剩余的金丹期魔修便是立时陨落，至于那元婴前期魔修也是没有能耐同时应付你二人，只得选择自爆元婴，以期给你们造成些许麻烦。¤After you joined, but a face to face the remaining Jindan stage evil cultivator is immediately fallen, as for the first YuanYing evil cultivator is also not able to deal with you two at the same time, only to choose to explode the YuanYing, in order to cause you some trouble.
这里怎会有魔修伏击？¤How can there be a evil cultivator ambush here?
更何况，那魔修眼看一击得手，并不准备给你喘息的时间，下一记足以致你陨落的神通俨然在蓄力中！¤What's more, that evil cultivator saw that he had won a blow and was not prepared to give you time to breathe, and the next divine power that would bring about your downfall was in the process of accumulating power!
去死吧！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Go to hell! {vpunch=10,0.5}
但未等你们得出结论，近旁的玄道宗大阵渐渐淡去。不多时，一道丈余高的通道出现在阵法上，随之走出一位身着白袍的修士。¤But before you could reach a conclusion, the great Mystic Dao Sect formation near by faded away. In a short time, a passage more than ten feet high appeared on the formation, and with it came out a cultivator dressed in white robes.
所以我们尝试联系玄道宗的幸存者，摸清天魔教的底细后再做打算，可能会更好。¤So it might be better if we try to contact the survivors of the Mystic Dao Sect and get to the bottom of the Heavenly Demon Cult before making plans.
但这魔修心里也没好受到哪去，即便他能解决你，还有炎萧等着他对付。¤But this evil cultivator's heart did not suffer much better, even if he could solve you, there is still Yan Xiao waiting for him to deal with.
但你并没有在意这些，只是淡定地前往他们的战场。¤But you don't care about that, just calmly head to their battlefield.
但未等你回答，近旁的玄道宗大阵渐渐淡去。不多时，一道丈余高的通道出现在阵法上，随之走出一位身着白袍的修士。¤But not waiting for your answer, the near side of the Mystic Dao Sect formation gradually fade away. In a short time, a ten-foot-high passage appeared on the formation, and with it came out a cultivator dressed in white robes.
嗯，由你决定。¤Well, it's up to you.
只见那魔修一声暴喝，一道精纯的魔气夹杂了厉啸之声向你突袭而来！¤Just see that the devil cultivator bellowed, a pure devil Qi mixed with the sound of harsh whistle towards you suddenly attacked!
葛白衣显然是在护宗大阵上打开个通道之前，就已经知道山脚处战后获胜的是你与炎萧二人，见到你们并没有太惊讶。¤Ge Baiyi apparently before the opening of a channel on the clan protection array, already know the foot of the mountain after the battle was won by you and Yan Xiao two, see you and not too surprised.
本就倾斜的胜利天平，此刻更是急转直下。¤The victory scale that was already tilted, now took an even more drastic turn.
这么说完，他转身便离去了。¤So saying, he turned and departed.
真是个奇怪的人...¤What a strange man...
焦飞的脸上闪过一丝厌恶的神色。¤A look of disgust flashed across Jiao Fei's face.
他们...必须死。¤They... must die.
小伤，无妨。¤Minor injury, no harm done.
这两人与你实力相仿，{$daoyou}下次还是应该谨慎一些。今日若非我也在此，你恐怕会受重伤啊。¤These two are similar in strength to you, {$daoyou} or should be more cautious next time. Today if I am not also here, you are afraid that you will be seriously injured ah.
焦飞。¤Jiao Fei.
呼...{$daoyou}，你没事吧？¤Hoo... {$daoyou}, are you okay?
但见他硬接一爪后，左手抓住那名禾山道修士的手腕，右手凝聚一团火球正中那人胸口。那人正面受此重伤，眼看是活不成了。¤After taking the claw, his left hand grabbed the wrist of the Wo Shan Tao cultivator, while his right hand gathered a ball of fire and hit him squarely in the chest. The man was so badly wounded that he was not going to survive.
今日...多谢。¤Today... Thanks a lot.
{$daoyou}，你没事吧？¤{$daoyou}, are you all right?
我名叫{FirstName}{LastName}，不知道友怎么称呼？¤My name is {FirstName}{LastName}, I don't know what you call me?
我调查村民失踪一案一路追查至此，这两个禾山道修士看来便是此案的始作俑者。¤I have followed the case of the missing villagers all the way to this point, and these two cultivators of Wo San Tao seem to be the ones who started the case.
焦兄的脾气还真是奇怪...¤Jiao has a really strange temper...
你见状不妙，也顾不上许多，扭头便跑。¤You see the situation and, not caring much, turn your head and run.
你抬眼看向{$jiaofei}，只见他招式大开大合，全然不顾自身安危，将那名禾山道修士压制的节节败退。¤You raise your eyes to {$jiaofei}, only to see that his stances are wide open, with no regard for his own safety, and he is suppressing that Wo Shan Dao cultivator.
多谢道友出手相助，若非道友仗义出手，在下恐怕今日便要殒命于此。¤Thank you for your help, if it were not for your kindness, I'm afraid I would have to die here today.
道友的救命之恩无以为报，这些灵石还请道友不要拒绝。¤There is no way to repay the kindness of saving your life, so please don't refuse these spirit stones.
哼，不自量力。¤Huh, overwhelming.
哼，怎么又来一个。¤Hm, why another one.
你猜测这些失踪的凡人应该是被禾山道的邪修，施展炼魂的邪术所伤。¤You guess that these missing mortals should have been injured by the evil cultivator of Heshan Dao and the evil practice of soul refining.
正准备仔细观察一番洞府外的禁制，却只听一声巨响，一名红袍修士驱使着数道天火砸向那座洞府，瞬间便将外围的禁制悉数毁去。¤As he was about to take a closer look at the restrictions outside the cave, he heard a loud bang as a red-robed cultivator drove several flames of heaven into the cave, destroying all the outer restrictions in an instant.
{$daoyou}，我调查村民失踪一案一路追查至此。你若不介意的话，我们一同出手如何？¤{I've been investigating the disappearance of villagers all the way to here. If you don't mind, how about we do it together?
你们离火门的长老我确实不敢惹，不过一个区区{$jingjie}的弟子，也敢三番两次与我们禾山道作对？¤It's true that I don't dare to mess with the elders of your Heavenly Fire Gate, but a mere {$jingjie} disciple dares to go against our Harvest Hill Dao three times?
顺着这股阴冷的气息一路追踪过去，你很快便来到一处隐蔽的洞府外。¤Following this chilling aura all the way through, you soon arrive outside a hidden cave.
另一名禾山修士见状不妙，转身便要逃...¤Another Wo Shan cultivator saw the situation and turned to flee...
他可不是一个人。¤He is not alone.
桀桀桀...那就送你们两个一起上路吧。¤Jie Jie Jie... Then let's send you both on your way together.
{$jiaofei}微微向你点头致意，随即便施展神通攻了上去。¤{$jiaofei} nods slightly in greeting to you, and then attacks with his divine powers.
{$jiaofei}面色阴郁，似乎对眼前之人颇为厌恶。也未与那二人多言，冷哼一声便施展神通攻了上去。¤{$jiaofei} had a gloomy face and seemed to be quite disgusted with the people in front of him. The two of them did not say much to each other, and with a cold snort they attacked with their divine powers.
真是晦气，怎么又是这厮？¤What a bummer, how come it's this guy again?
这两名禾山道的修士看来与那名红袍修士修为相当，你决定...¤These two cultivators from Wo Shan Tao appear to be of comparable cultivation to the red-robed cultivator, have you decided...
桀桀桀...既然你不自量力一个人送上门来，那我可就不客气了。¤Hehehe... Since you don't think you have the strength to come to the door alone, I will not be polite.
是他？¤Is it him?
呃啊...¤Uhhhh...
他虽说以一敌二，但招招皆是不顾自身危险，以命搏命的打法。反观那禾山道的二人心有顾虑，一时之间竟被压制的节节败退。¤Although he fought one against two, all his moves were made in spite of the danger to himself, fighting for his life. On the other hand, the two men from Wo Shan Road were so worried that they were pinned back for a while.
道友，对于休息阵法可感兴趣？¤Friends, are you interested in the rest formation?
接着他又连掐法印，召出一簇森冷的黑色灵焰，转瞬间将那蓬莎岛修士的尸体烧得连灰都不剩。¤Then he repeatedly pinched the seal, summoned a cluster of cold black spiritual flames, and in a flash, burned the body of the cultivator on Pongsha Island to ashes.
住...住手！别打了，我认输！¤Stop...Stop! Stop fighting, I give up!
这般手段，饶是以你如今修为看来依旧感到诡异可怖，简直与你之前遇到的魔门修士不相上下。¤With such a method, Rao still feels weird and terrible from your current cultivation base, which is almost on par with the evil cultivators you met before.
你不动声色，敛息潜伏在一旁。那千流岛的修士似乎怀揣着什么保护神识的法宝，抵御着蓬莎岛修士的垂死反扑。没过多久，那名蓬莎岛修士终于耗尽真气，失去了灵气护罩的保护，被袖箭捅了个对穿。¤You are calm, keeping your breath and lurking aside. The cultivator on Qianliu Island seems to have some magic weapon to protect the divine consciousness, resisting the dying counterattack of the cultivator on Pongsha Island. It didn't take long for the cultivator on Pongsha Island to finally consume Exhausted, lost the protection of the aura shield, and was stabbed in the opposite direction by the sleeve arrows.
他的手法看起来颇为娴熟，轻轻松松便抹去了储物袋外留下的神念。那储物袋外灵光大现，但没挣扎几下便迅速黯淡了下来，落到地上。¤His technique looks quite skillful, and he easily erased the divine thoughts left on the outside of the storage bag. The outside of the storage bag was bright, but he quickly dimmed without struggling for a few strokes, and fell to the ground. .
从他们二人的衣着与招式，你判断他们分别是蓬莎岛和千流岛的修士。¤From the clothes and moves of the two of them, you can judge that they are cultivators from Pongsha Island and Qianliu Island, respectively.
你循着交战声走近，远远地便看到有两名修士正驱使着各种法宝打得不可开交。¤You approached following the sound of the fighting, and from a distance, you saw two cultivators driving various magic weapons into a fight.
那人似乎很谨慎，用神识四下探查了一番，这才开始检查那名蓬莎岛修士的尸体。索性你于敛息一道颇有心得，没有被他发现。¤The man seemed to be very cautious, and he used his soul sense to explore around, and only then began to examine the body of the cultivator on Pongsha Island. You are quite knowledgeable about restraining your breath, and he didn't find it.
你不想被卷入这场莫名的战斗中，连忙退走，找了一个隐蔽的角落敛息躲下。直到交战声慢慢消失才离开此地。¤You don't want to be involved in this inexplicable battle. You quickly retreat and find a hidden corner to hide your breath. You didn't leave here until the sound of fighting slowly disappeared.
此人所修术法深不可测，你也没有必胜的把握，只能眼睁睁看着他处理完现场，而后采下仙草扬长而去。¤This person's technique is unfathomable, and you are not sure of victory. You can only watch him finish the scene, and then pick the fairy grass and grow away.
还未等你反应过来，便感到一道冰冷的气息扫过，令你汗毛直立。下一秒，那柄袖箭便破空向你刺来...¤Before you can react, you feel a cold breath sweeping through, making your hair stand upright. In the next second, that sleeve arrow will pierce you through the air...
只要你放我走，这洞窟里的月灵花就全归你了，我绝对不会再有任何想法！¤As long as you let me go, the Moonspirit Blossoms in this cave will all belong to you, and I wont try anything!
那名千流岛的修士看来已是金丹后期修为，驱使的法宝上下翻飞，连续不断地攻击在蓬莎岛修士那已经摇摇欲坠的灵气护罩上。¤The cultivator of Qianliu Island seems to have been cultivated in the late Jindan stage, and the magic weapon driven to fly up and down, continuously attacking the already crumbling aura shield of the cultivator of Pongsha Island.
而那名蓬莎岛修士虽然还能够勉力支撑，但显然已经完全没有了还手的余力。¤Although the cultivator of Pongsha Island can still support it, he obviously has no room to fight back at all.
那蓬莎岛修士又惊又恼，眼看便要命陨于此...{w}{w=0.5}¤The cultivator on Pongsha Island was shocked and annoyed, and he died here...{w}{w=0.5}
道友小心！¤Friends, be careful!
那千流岛修士却仿佛没有听到似的，依旧面不改色地操控着法宝向对方攻去。¤The cultivator of Qianliu Island didn't seem to hear it, and still controlled the magic weapon to attack the opponent without changing his face.
前方传来一阵激烈的交战声，看来是有什么人在此处发生了争斗...{w}{w=0.5}¤There was a fierce battle in front of you. It seems that someone is fighting here...{w}{w=0.5}
你到底想怎样，难道非要斩尽杀绝？¤What do you want, do you have to kill them all?
你实力不足，自身难保，也再顾不得别人，只能匆匆逃离了此地。¤You are not strong enough to protect yourself, and you can no longer care about others, you can only flee here in a hurry.
《魔焰决》是我派开山祖师所创秘术，修炼速度甚至比一些地阶功法更快，但每练一层，都会折损修炼之人大量的寿元。¤《 Devil Flame Art 》 is a secret cultivation method created by the founder of our sect, and it's cultivation speed is even faster than some Earth-level training method, but each level of practice will damage the cultivator's lifespan.
{shidi}初来乍到，作为师兄我便私下赠与你一些火晶，你可小心切莫被长老知晓。¤{shidi} first arrived, as a senior, I will give you some fire crystals privately, you can be careful not to be known by the elders.
本派入门功法有《引火决》，《化焰决》和《魔焰决》，你想学习哪一个？¤This school's introductory cultivation techniques include《 Fire-Setting Mantra》,《 Living Flame Mantra》and《 Devil Flame Mantra》. Which one do you want to learn?

这几种功法类型各有优劣，你也可以同时兼修多个不同的功法，但我建议你把修炼速度最快的功法，作为你的{color=#d0380a}主修功法{/color}¤These types of exercises each have their own strengths and weaknesses. You can also practice multiple different techniques at the same time if you want, but I suggest you use the fastest cultivation technique as your {color=#d0380a} Major Technique{/color}
《引火决》是战斗类的功法，修炼后能够提升五行连击后火系法门的威能。¤Fire Fighting Jue is a combat technique. After practicing, it can increase the power of the fire system after the five-element combo.
哈哈，宗门内的资源可不能用灵石换取，只有对宗门做出贡献的弟子才有资格在藏经阁与神兵阁兑换功法及法器，而这火晶正是弟子们贡献度的体现。¤Haha, the resources in the sect cannot be exchanged for spirit stones. Only the disciples who have contributed to the sect are eligible to exchange exercises and artifacts in the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion and the Shenbing Pavilion, and this fire crystal is the disciple. The embodiment of contribution.
...嗯，这几本就差不多了...{shidi}之前对修炼的功法可有了解？¤...Well, these books are almost the same...Does {shidi} have any knowledge of cultivation techniques before?
《化焰决》是中庸类的功法，修炼后便能快速在战斗中进入【化焰】状态，反击对手的攻击。¤《Living Flame Mantra》 is a mediocre type of technique. After practicing, you can quickly enter the 【Living Flame】 state in battle and counterattack the opponent's attack.
一般同阶的功法可以分为几种类型，战斗类的功法可以在与人斗法时提供更强的帮助，修炼类的功法则在修炼速度上有很大的优势，而中庸型的功法则都能兼顾的到。¤Generally, there are several types of exercises of the same level. Combat-type exercises can provide stronger help when fighting against people. Cultivation-type exercises have a great advantage in the speed of cultivation, while those of moderate type The principles of the exercises can be taken into account.
往年都只有宗门最厉害的几位师兄，才敢到天魔眼的{color=#d0380a}中心区域{/color}猎魔。¤In previous years, only the most powerful seniors in the sect dared to hunt the demon in the {color=#d0380a}central area{/color} of the eyes of the demon.

林沐雪回来后，虽是对王登的不辞而别有些疑惑，但也没有多问什么。¤Lin Mu Xue came back, although Wang Deng's unannounced departure is a little confused, but did not ask anything more.
你随手将之挂在腰间，就当是王登此前口无遮拦的代价。之后便是继续品茶赏花等林沐雪回来。¤You will hang it on your waist, as the price of Wang Deng's previous mouth. After that, you can continue to enjoy tea and flowers and wait for Lin Mu Xue to return.
你与林沐雪闲聊一段时间后，便是尽兴离去。且在告辞时，与对方互在传音符中留下神识印记，留作以后交流用。¤You and Lin Mu Xue chatted for a while and then left to your heart's content. And in the farewell, and each other in the voice transmission talisman left soul sense imprint, left for future communication.
王登不敢再说什么，只得狼狈地离去了。你留意到一个储物袋静静地躺在地上，可能是刚才战斗时从王登身上掉落的。¤Wang Deng did not dare to say anything else, only to wretchedly left. You notice a storage pouch lying quietly on the ground, probably dropped from Wang Deng's body during the battle just now.
数招过后，你以神通击破王登防御，对方也是面色惨白地跌坐在地。¤After a few moves, you break Wang Deng's defense with divine power, and the other party also falls to the ground with a pale face.
你虽是不服，但也无可奈何，只能忍气吞声。¤Although you are not convinced, but there is nothing you can do, you can only hold your breath.
林沐雪显示是猜到了什么，但也只好在送你出府后一番道歉。¤Lin Mu Xue shows is guessed what, but also had to send you out of the house after some apologies.
算你狠，下次再见到，有你好看！¤You are cruel, next time I see you, I will have you look good!
看来星宫的秘术也不怎么样嘛。¤It seems that the secret arts of the Star Palace are not good either.
面对你的挑衅，王登没有再说什么，只是趁着林沐雪还未归来，狼狈离去了。¤In the face of your provocation, Wang Deng did not say anything more, just took advantage of the fact that Lin Mu Xue has not yet returned, wretchedly left.
你留意到一个储物袋静静地躺在地上，可能是刚才战斗时从王登身上掉落的。¤You notice a storage bag lying quietly on the ground, probably dropped from Wang Deng's body during the battle just now.
这点实力就不要学别人放狠话了，小心咬了舌头。¤This point of strength do not learn others to put harsh words, careful to bite the tongue.

王登正想再说些什么，可林沐雪适时带着茶具回到花园，他只好闭口不言。¤Wang Deng was about to continue speaking, but Lin Muxue returned with another teaset and he quickly stopped.
哼，小妮子嘴上...¤Hmph, the little girl's mouth...
哼，以后长点记性，别往你配不上的人身边凑。¤Humph, in the future, grow up and don't come around people you don't deserve.
你虽是不服，但也无可奈何。也不愿再与此人交流，于是找了个借口准备先行离去。¤You are not convinced, but there is nothing you can do about it. I don't want to communicate with this person anymore, so I find an excuse and prepare to leave first.
当众人基本兑换完毕，纷纷离开之时，阁主从后方叫住了你。¤When the crowd basically finished exchanging, have left, the pavilion master called you from the back.

最近，寨主在和他们大护法研究以蛊虫入丹也不知到进度怎么样，真成了咱们古月寨也不用再偏安一隅了。¤Recently, the owner of the fortress and their Great Guardian are studying the use of compulsions into the pills and I do not know how the progress is.
切，要不是寨主念及同门之情，这玄古门如何能在宁州立足？要我说他们趁早并入我们古月寨才是正道～¤If it weren't for the master's love for his fellow clansmen, how could the Profound Ancient Clan have gained a foothold in Ning Province? If I were to say so, it would be the right thing to do if they were to merge into our Gu Yue Village.
哈哈哈，说邪门能比得过咱们古月寨？不过，他们这丹药后劲太大了，听说有个傻子过于冒进，连服三颗差点没给丹毒带走。¤Hahahaha, to say that evil can compare to our ancient moon fortress? However, their Pill is so powerful that I heard that a foolish man was too adventurous and almost didn't give up the Pill after taking three pills in a row.
你倒是乐观，此事本就是以玄古门为主到时候咱们能分得几成好处还是两说。¤You are optimistic, this matter is originally based on the Profound Ancient Sect at the time we can share a few percent of the benefits or two.
前面有两个巡逻弟子，看装束好像是古月寨弟子。¤There were two patrolling disciples in front of them, and looking at their attire they seemed to be disciples of the Ancient Moon Cottage.
嘴上留情啊，继续巡山吧。¤Keep your mouth shut and keep patrolling the hills.
要说这玄古门也有几分门道啊。他们这炼丹之法看着邪性，这丹药效果却也真的不错嘛。¤The Profound Ancient Sect has a few tricks up its sleeve. Their method of refining pills looks evil, but the effect of these pills is really good.
哈哈哈，{FirstName}{shidi}，恭喜你又一次拿到宗门大比的魁首。¤Hahaha, {FirstName}{shidi}, congratulations on getting the leader of the Zongmen Grand Competition again.

唉，{$NickName}莫要嘲弄我了，被击碎了法宝谁能看的开，只是重新炼制一个合适的法宝傍身于我而言更紧要罢了。¤Alas, {$NickName} don't make fun of me, who can see the broken magic weapon, it's just more important to me to re-refine a suitable magic weapon.
呃，这倒不是。¤Well, it's not.
所以我也没放在心上，便当做是没听到。¤So I didn't take it to heart, and I thought I didn't hear it.

不愿也罢，我另想办法吧。¤If you don't want to, I'll think of another way.
感谢你能前来，{FirstName}{$NickName}。¤Thank you for coming, {FirstName}{$NickName}.
既然{FirstName}{$NickName}无暇前往，那{$ZaiXia}也就不多叨扰{$NickName}了。¤Since {FirstName}{$NickName} has no time to go, {$ZaiXia} won't bother {$NickName} much.
也正因如此，{$ZiaXia}不知同辈中除{FirstName}{$NickName}外还有谁能轻易解决金丹期妖王。¤Because of this, {$ZiaXia} doesn't know who can easily solve the Golden Core Stage Demon King except {FirstName}{$NickName}.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，感谢你能受{$ZaiXia}之邀前来。¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, thank you for being invited by {$ZaiXia}.
我本就无意争斗，以后提放着些便是。¤I had no intention of fighting at all, so I'll just put it aside in the future.
这倒不是。¤Not so.
唉，此事说来话长，还请{$NickName}听我从头道来。¤Alas, this is a long story, but {$NickName} please listen to me from the beginning.
事情是这样的，半月前有一修士缠着我想切磋，我实在拒绝不了他，只好接受。却没想切磋开始后，他却一口咬定我的法宝是赝品，当场便激动起来。¤Here's the thing. Half a month ago, a cultivator pestered me to discuss, but I couldn't refuse him, so I had to accept it. But he didn't think that after the sparring started, he insisted that my magic weapon was a fake, and became excited on the spot.
后来我费劲心思{$CaiLiaoName}的消息。虽是有所收获，但，凡是奇珍所在必有危险相伴，{$CaiLiaoName}所在亦是如此。¤Then I struggled with the {$CaiLiaoName} message. Although it has been rewarded, there is always danger in the location of rare treasures, and the same is true for the location of {$CaiLiaoName}.
所以想请{FirstName}{$NickName}代我前往取得{$CaiLiaoName}。这妖王实力十分强劲，但相对的它身上的皮、骨、妖丹等都是稀有炼器材料，放在平日也是难寻得很。¤So I would like to ask {FirstName}{$NickName} to go and get {$CaiLiaoName} on my behalf. This demon king is very powerful, but the skin, bones, demon pills, etc. on his body are all rare refining materials, and they are hard to find on weekdays.
此处正是一金丹期妖王的巢穴，若是放在平时我倒不惧它，但如今法宝被击碎，只剩备用法宝傍身，恐难敌之。¤This is the lair of a Golden Core Stage Demon King. I wouldn't be afraid of it if I put it in normal times, but now that the magic weapon has been shattered, only the backup magic weapon is left, and I am afraid that it will be difficult to fight against.
找{FirstName}{$NickName}来只是想让你帮我搜集材料好重新打造一个法宝而已。¤Looking for {FirstName}{$NickName} just want you to help me gather materials to re-create a magic weapon.
当时我也是一愣，竟没想起与他理论。这修士也是鸡贼的很，竟趁我愣神的功夫扬长而去。¤At the time, I was stunned for a moment, but I didn't even think of having a theory with him. This cultivator is also a thief, and he took advantage of my stupefied effort to get away.
却没想那人在切磋时对着我的法宝屡下重手，最后不知是用什么剑诀将我那法宝对半斩开。¤But I didn't think that the man repeatedly hit my magic weapon with heavy hands during the sparring, and finally I don't know what sword technique was used to cut my magic weapon in half.
唉，那法宝确实是仿制了我所仰慕前辈的作品。但我不过是出于对前辈的尊敬，法宝又是自己所用并未拿去招摇撞骗，怎么能算赝品呢？{$NickName}你说是不是？¤Alas, that magic weapon is indeed a copy of the works of the predecessors I admire. But I'm just out of respect for the seniors, and the magic weapon is used by myself and not used to swindle. How can it be considered a fake? {$NickName} You said yes?
(这场面怎么似曾相识？）¤(How does this scene seem familiar?)
若是事成，我只需{$CaiLiaoName}，其他材料尽归{FirstName}{$NickName}所有。除此之外，另有谢礼奉上。¤If it works, all I need is {$CaiLiaoName} and {FirstName}{$NickName} owns all other materials. In addition to this, there is a thank you gift.
说完，{$NpcName}便独自离去了。¤After speaking, {$NpcName} left alone.
那{$CaiLiaoName}便在...¤Then {$CaiLiaoName} is in...
那你找我来是？¤So are you looking for me?
我虽心有不甘，但当务之急还是重新炼制一个合适的法宝傍身更要紧。¤Although I am unwilling, the most important thing is to re-refining a suitable magic weapon.
所以我最近一直在寻找{$CaiLiaoName}的消息，最近才有收获。只是那{$CaiLiaoName}所在之地乃是金丹期妖王的巢穴。¤So I've been looking for news about {$CaiLiaoName} lately, only to find out recently. It's just that the place where {$CaiLiaoName} is located is the lair of the Golden Core Stage Demon King.
但说无妨。¤But it doesn't matter.
若是平时我可不惧他，但如今我法宝被击碎，只剩备用法宝傍身，怕不是那孽畜的对手，就想请你帮我摆平那妖王并取得{$CaiLiaoName}。¤If I normally wouldn't be afraid of him, but now my magic weapon has been shattered, and I have only a spare magic weapon left, I'm afraid it's not the opponent of the evil beast, so I want you to help me settle the demon king and get {$CaiLiaoName}.
事情是这样的，半月前有人想与我切磋一番，眼看他十分热情，我也不好拒绝，只得应肯。却没成想我亮出法宝后，他却硬说我的法宝是赝品，当时便激动了起来。¤The thing is, someone wanted to discuss with me half a month ago. Seeing that he was very enthusiastic, I could not refuse, so I had to agree. But he didn't think that after I showed the magic weapon, he insisted that my magic weapon was a fake, and he got excited at that time.
赝品？¤Fake?
道友倒也看得开。¤Fellow Daoist can see it.
道友不用客气。¤Daoist, don't be polite.
我那法宝可不是什么赝品，但...确实是在外形和能力上仿制了我所仰慕前辈的作品。但我不过向他学习而已，这法宝也是自己所用，并未拿去招摇撞骗，怎么能算赝品呢？{$NickName}你说是不是？¤My magic weapon is not a fake, but... it does imitate the works of the predecessors I admire in terms of appearance and ability. But I just learned from him. This magic weapon is also used by myself, and I didn't use it to swindle. How can it be considered a fake? {$NickName} You said yes?
找我何事？¤What's the matter with me?
{FirstName}{$NickName}若是得手，我只取所需的{$CaiLiaoName}，其他材料尽归{FirstName}{$NickName}所有。除此之外，另有谢礼奉上。¤If {FirstName}{$NickName} is successful, I will only take the {$CaiLiaoName} that I need, and all other materials will be owned by {FirstName}{$NickName}. In addition to this, there is a thank you gift.
多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}，有你出手，那{$ZaiXia}便放心了。¤Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName}, {$ZaiXia} will be relieved if you take action.
还不是之前跟人切磋被打碎了法宝。打碎也就算了，还诋毁说我法宝是赝品，你说气不气人？¤It's not that the magic weapon was smashed by someone before. It’s okay to break it, and you still slander that my magic weapon is a fake. Are you angry?
{$Xiao},我就知道找你准没问题。¤{$Xiao}, I knew I would be fine with you.
我虽然不是受了气还无动于衷的类型，但报复还要找人帮忙也不是我的风格，只有自己来才解气。¤Although I'm not the type to be indifferent when angered, but it's not my style to ask for help in revenge.
{FirstName}{$NickName} ，你终于来了。¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, you're finally here.
唉，此事说来丢脸，但还请{$NickName}听我从头道来¤Alas, shame on this, but please {$NickName} listen to me from the beginning
哈哈哈哈，现在才想起求饶，是不是太晚了些。就区区这般实力，也敢与我相斗，简直不自量力。¤Hahahahaha, only now remember to beg for mercy, is it too late? You dare to fight me with this kind of strength, you don't even know your own strength.
你循着交战声走近，远远地便看到有两名修士正驱使着各种法宝打得不可开交。但显然，其中一方已经占尽上风，另一方则只能苦苦支撑，高下立判。¤You follow the sound of the battle closer, far away you can see two cultivators are driving a variety of magic treasures to fight. But obviously, one of them has the upper hand, the other side can only struggle to support, the high and low.
住...住手！阁下不过是想些身外之物，在下双手奉上便是，阁下又何必非要赶尽杀绝！¤Stop... Stop! You just want something outside of my body, I'll give it to you with both hands, why do you have to kill all of them?
你不想被卷入这场莫名的战斗中，连忙退走，找了一个隐蔽的角落敛息躲下。直到交战声慢慢消失才离开此地...¤You do not want to be involved in this inexplicable battle, and hastily retreat, looking for a hidden corner to converge to hide under. Until the sound of fighting slowly disappeared before leaving this place ...
对方衡量了一番，最终还是离开了。¤The other party weighed the situation and finally left.
一道极具攻击性的神识扫过，显然，你被什么人给盯上了...¤A very offensive divine consciousness swept across, obviously, you were being targeted by someone...
前方传来一阵剧烈的灵气波动与打斗声。显然，有什么人正在附近交手...¤There was a violent aura fluctuation and fighting sound from up ahead. Apparently, someone is fighting nearby...
那名散修又惊又恼，眼看便要命陨于此。你决定...¤The independent cultivator was frightened and annoyed, and looked like he was going to die here. You decided...
桀桀桀...算你识相。¤Jie Jie Jie... count you as acquaintance.
你斩下巨蟒硕大的蛇头，数十丈长的蛇身在寒潭中翻滚搅动，染红了一池潭水...¤You cut off the giant snake head of the giant python, and the body of the snake tens of feet long rolled and stirred in the cold pool, dyeing a pool of water red...
很好，辛苦你了，这是任务奖励。我还有宗门事务在身，恕不远送。¤Very well, thanks for your hard work. This is a reward for the mission. I still have clan business to attend to, so I'm sorry I won't see you off.
遇到过 有人潜入，不过已经被我击毙了。¤I have encountered someone sneaking in, but I have killed it.
{shidi}，你先下去养伤吧。我还有宗门事务在身，恕不远送。¤{shidi}, you go down to heal your injury first. I still have sect affairs, so I won’t be far away.
我{SayStcVal=928}盛名在外，自然没有宵小之辈出没。¤I {SayStcVal=928} is very famous, so naturally there is no such thing as the younger generation.
我还有宗门事务在身，恕不远送。¤I still have sect affairs, so I won’t be far away.
{shidi}，此番值守可有异常？¤{shidi}, is there anything unusual about this time guard?
多是些吸纳了些灵气的野兽，灵智不清，哼，竟对我{SayStcVal=928}门下出手，看来执事堂又要着手清扫一下{SayStcVal=943}了，¤It's mostly beasts that have absorbed some auras, unconscious, huh, they actually shot at me {SayStcVal=928}. It seems that the Deacon's Hall is about to clean {SayStcVal=943} again,
任务完成，前来复命。¤The mission is complete, come and return.
哦？连示警都没有，这是我山门守备的失职啊，我会吩咐下去加强戒备的，这枚丹药算是我个人的补偿了。¤Oh? There is not even a warning. This is the negligence of my mountain gate defense. I will order to step up my guard. This pill is my personal compensation.
多是些吸纳了些灵气的野兽，灵智不清，哼，竟对我{SayStcVal=928}门下出手，{shidi}你也算是协助执事堂清扫了{SayStcVal=943}，这枚丹药算是我个人的酬谢了。¤It's mostly beasts that have absorbed some auras, unconscious, huh, they actually shot at me {SayStcVal=928}, {shidi} you can also be regarded as assisting the deacon hall to clean {SayStcVal=943}, this pill It's my personal reward.
我{SayStcVal=928}盛名在外，自然没有宵小之辈出没，不过倒是遇到了了妖兽作祟。¤I {SayStcVal=928} is very famous, and naturally I don't have a small group of people, but I have encountered monsters.
{shidi}，被发现的时候就已经昏迷了，潜入的宵小之辈已被长老擒住，你不必担心，只是{shidi}你还需勤加修炼。¤{shidi}, I was in a coma when I was discovered. The Xiao Xiaozhi who sneaked in has been captured by the elders. You don't have to worry, but {shidi} you still need to practice harder.
我遭受妖兽突袭，慌乱之下不是其敌手，所以....¤I was attacked by a monster, and I was not its opponent in a panic, so...
{shidi}，这么早就回来了？¤{shidi}, came back so early?
9005，妖兽巢穴1¤9005, Monster Lair 1
正当你思索问题所在之时，异变陡生。¤Just as you are pondering the problem, a sudden change occurs.
片刻后，随着笑声的消散，裂缝的弥合，仿佛一切都归于了平静。¤A few moments later, as the laughter dissipated and the cracks closed, it was as if everything had returned to peace.
既然李司魂他们都已殒命当场，那逆天造化术应该就在附近，不妨帮我搜索一番吧。¤Since Li Si Soul and the others have perished on the spot, the Reverse Heaven Creation Art should be nearby, so why not help me search for it?
荧儿，没事吧？¤Is everything all right?
结局已尘埃落定，你再如何感叹也是无用。¤The dust has settled, you can no longer lament is useless.
玉简上面记载，重铸肉身需要借助飞升之人所引动的仙灵之气，可刚刚何曾有仙灵之气降下？¤The jade slip states that recasting the flesh body requires the help of the immortal spirit energy induced by the person who ascended, but where did the immortal spirit energy descend just now?
嗯？哪里不对？¤Hmm? What's wrong?
就在你用神识仔细阅读玉简时，异变陡生。¤Just when you read the jade slip carefully with your soul sense, a strange change occurred.
神识扫去，只见她身形异常狼狈，身体肉眼可见的有几处缺口，其中阴气正向外逸散。¤God consciousness sweep away, only to see her body is unusually wretched, the body visible to the naked eye there are several gaps, which Yin gas is escaping outward.
……不对。¤...... is not correct.
这…难道说她失败了？¤This...does it mean that she failed?
她竟然真的飞升成功了…？简直难以置信…¤She has really succeeded in ascending...? I can't believe it...
哪里出问题了？¤Where did something go wrong?
你又等了一会，月亮上黑影退去，天地间阴气又回归到了往常的水平。¤You wait a while longer, the moon on the black shadows recede, and the Yin Qi between heaven and earth returned to the usual level.
这阴魂岛仿佛什么都没有发生过一般，若不是亲眼见证了这一切，你定会以为这原本便是座空岛。¤This soul island as if nothing had happened in general, if not witnessed all this, you will think that this is originally an empty island.
听了你的话后，她猛然一怔，随即又莫名暴怒起来，不由分说地向你攻来。¤After hearing your words, she was stunned and then inexplicably enraged, and attacked you without any reason.
你觉得自己应该替她感到开心才对，却不知为何有些落寞。¤You feel like you should be happy for her, but I don't know why I'm a little lonely.
她眼神呆滞，不停地自言自语着。你有些担心她的状况，便飞了过去。¤Her eyes were dull and she kept muttering to herself. You were a little worried about her condition, so you flew over.
你且看看，玉简上面记载，重铸肉身需要借助飞升之人所引动的仙灵之气，可刚刚何曾有仙灵之气降下？¤Look, it is written on the jade slip that the re-casting of the flesh needs to be done with the help of the immortal spirit energy induced by the ascended one, but where has the immortal spirit energy descended just now?
只见空间一阵波动，高空中撕开了一个极其不规整的空间裂口，一个黑影从中倒飞而出。¤I saw a fluctuation in space, high in the air tore open an extremely irregular space rift, a black shadow from which flew backwards.
我明明感应到了才对？¤I clearly sensed it, didn't I?
为什么会找不到？？¤Why can't you find it?
你来到之前李司魂所在阵法周围，果然找到了一枚刻有“逆天造化术”的玉简。¤You came to the formation where Li Si Spirit was, and you found a jade slip inscribed with the 'Heavenly Creation Technique'.
有这等事？¤There is such a thing?
的确…可刚刚那一幕又如何解释？¤Indeed...but how can that scene just now be explained?
可惜没能早点得到此术，不然你今日便能重获新生了。¤It is a pity that you did not get this technique earlier, otherwise you would be able to regain your life today.
这天劫的威能，当真不可小觑。¤The power of this heavenly tribulation is really not to be underestimated.
当年与道友切磋论道之场景，尚历历在目。未曾想，道友如今却是领先我一步了。¤I can still remember the scene when I discussed the dao with you. I never thought that you would be one step ahead of me now.
不错的灵力，这嗜焰蟒绝非普通的筑基期妖兽实力，要小心应对！¤Not bad spiritual power, this flame-thirsty python is definitely not an ordinary base-building monster strength, you have to deal with it carefully!
一名{SayStcVal=928}的巡逻弟子从前方经过，但因为修为太低，并没有发现你的存在。¤A {SayStcVal=928} patrol disciple passed by, but because his cultivation level was too low, he didn't notice your existence.
势力上传出现错误¤An error occurred during the upload of forces
一名宗门的巡逻弟子经过，恭敬的向你行礼。¤A patrol disciple of the sect passed by and salutes you respectfully.
一名宗门的巡逻弟子从前方经过，向你点头示意。¤A sect patrol disciple passed by and nodded to you.
站住！此地{SayStcVal=928}所属，闲杂人等速速离去！¤Stop! This place {SayStcVal=928} belongs to, and the idlers leave at the same speed!
这功法名叫《忘忧决》，是我偶然所得，虽然只是残本，但误打误撞之下，也让我参悟出了大半奥秘，便在与人交战时快速恢复消耗的灵气。¤This exercise is called Wangyou Jue, which I obtained accidentally. Although it is only a stubble copy, it has also made me understand most of the mystery by mistakes, and I quickly recovered from the consumption when fighting with people. Reiki.
老夫尚有重要之事未完成，现在也该去办了，{xiaozi}，你我便就此别过，日后有缘再见吧！¤The old man still has important things unfinished, so it's time to do it now, {xiaozi}, you and I will leave it alone, and see you in the future!
这件法宝唤作御灵盾，是少有的防御性法器，你若熟练使用，炼气同阶之内的战斗，可保你性命无忧。¤This magic weapon is called the Imperial Spirit Shield. It is a rare defensive magic weapon. If you use it proficiently, fighting within the same level of refining qi can protect your life.
（呼~这天邪子看来是邪道中人我还是回白帝楼汇报一下吧 。）¤(Huh~ This day the evil son seems to be a member of the evil way, I should report back to Baidilou.)
你此番帮了老夫，老夫自会兑现自己的承诺。这些年我游历天下，收集了不少功法秘籍，丹药法宝，你想要什么，尽管说来。¤You helped the old man this time, and the old man will honor his promise. I have traveled around the world over the years and collected a lot of exercise secrets, pill magic weapons, whatever you want, just say it.
哈哈哈哈，没想到天邪子机关算尽，最后却在你这个炼气{xiaozi}的手下殒了命，真是时也，命也！¤Hahahaha, I didn't expect that Tianxiezi's organs were exhausted, but in the end he was killed by your Qi Refining {xiaozi}. It's really time and life!
你如今才炼气修为，药力过猛的丹药也不适合你。这三颗养气丹，虽然只是二品丹药，也可帮你精进修为。¤You are only in Qi Refinement, not suitable for Pills that are too powerful. These three Lesser Qi Pills, though only second-grade, can still help you with your cultivation.
多亏前辈的蛊术精湛，我才能侥幸取胜。¤Thanks to the predecessor's superb Gu technique, I can get lucky.
如今天邪子道陨，算是除去了老夫的心头一患。你修为虽浅，但心智品性却和老夫年轻时有几番相像，日后若有机缘，也该有一番成就。¤Like the evil son of today, it can be regarded as getting rid of the old man's heart trouble. Although your cultivation is shallow, but your mental character is similar to that of the old man when you were young, if you have a chance in the future, you should also have some achievements.
好了，就是这里。¤Well, here it is.
在渡劫之前我还需调息一番。{shidi}可愿意代我前去与诸位道友打个招呼？¤I still need to take some time to rest before I cross the tribulation. Would {shidi} be willing to go and say hello to you all on my behalf?
你与白帝二人从广陵城出发，一路飞至北宁海。不多时，混元子的声音穿过厚重的雷云传到你耳边。¤You and the White Emperor both set off from Guangling City and fly all the way to the North Sea of Ning. Not long afterwards, the voice of the Hybrid Son reaches you through the thick thunder clouds.
不多时，混元子的声音穿过厚重的雷云传到你耳边。¤Not long afterwards, the voice of the Hybrid Son reaches you through the thick thunder clouds.
这里的灵气...¤The aura here...
循声而望，隐约可见一片岛屿，想必他便是在其中某座岛上，只是不知与之对饮的修士是哪位。¤When I looked at the sound, I could see an island. I think he was on one of them, but I don't know which cultivator was drinking with him.
果然如你所推测，白鹿真人独自依靠在一旁的树上，混元子则与化为人形的火麒麟饮酒攀谈。¤As you surmised, the White Deer was leaning alone on a tree while the Hybrid Son drank and talked with the Fire Qilin, who had taken human form.
{size=31}“来来来,喝酒喝酒。”{/size}¤{size=31}''Come, come, come, drink, drink.'' {/size}
但白帝也就邀请了宁州的几位化神修士，白鹿为人孤僻，星凝又不像是能跟混元子聊得来的样子，应当是明山散人或火麒麟没错了。¤But the White Emperor had only invited a few Deity Transformation cultivators from Ning Province. Bai Lu was a loner, and Xing Ning did not look like she could get along with the Mixer, so it should be the Ming Mountain Scatterer or the Fire Qilin.
我曾于此有过一些机缘，在此之后这片岛屿便一直保持现在的状态。也有个几百年了，不知为何竟未被周遭海域同化。¤I had a chance here once and the island has remained in its present state ever since. It has been here for hundreds of years, but somehow it has not been assimilated by the surrounding sea.
你一边胡思乱想着，一边在白帝的带领下来到混元子面前。¤As you ruminate on this, you come before the Mixed-Up Son, led by the White Emperor.
这片岛屿的灵气与此海域其余地方相比，少了一份狂暴，却有些稀薄。¤The aura on this island is less violent than the rest of this sea, but somewhat thinner.
好，交给我吧。¤OK, leave it to me.
正当你和白帝交流着，明山散人也降落到这座小岛上。朝白帝点了点头后便是加入了在一旁吃喝的二人组。¤Just as you and the White Emperor are exchanging words, Ming Shan Sanren also lands on the island. After nodding towards the White Emperor he is joining the duo who are eating and drinking at the side.
铁剑又一次从你的背后挣脱出来，飞至半空之中，绽开绚烂的红光。周围的魔气汇聚于此，围绕着剑身上下翻腾！¤The iron sword broke free from your back again, and flew into the air, bursting with a brilliant red light. The devil energy around it gathered here, and it writhed around the sword!
那你的记忆呢？你有想起来些什么么？¤What about your memories? Do you remember anything?
再加上它刚刚吸收的这些魔气...这肯定不是普通的法宝能够做到的...¤Plus the devilish energy it has just absorbed... this is definitely not something ordinary magic weapons can do...
它刚刚吸收完魔气，应该就已经提升了一个档次了，就连我都觉得自己的魂魄又壮大了几分。想来若是有足够的魔气作为补充，它是有自行恢复的能力的。¤It has just absorbed the devil energy, it should have been upgraded to a level, even I feel that my soul has grown a bit. I think if there is enough devil energy to supplement it, it has the ability to recover on its own.
不错...不错...¤Not bad...
片刻之后，魔气消散，铁剑又哐当一声落在了地上。你运足灵气将铁剑吸回，却差点一把抓空！吸收了魔气的铁剑虽然外表没有明显的变化，重量却几乎变重了数倍...¤After a while, the devilish energy dissipated, and the iron sword fell on the ground with a clatter. You took the spirit energy to suck the iron sword back, but almost grabbed it! Although the iron sword that absorbed the evil energy did not change significantly in appearance, its weight was almost Heavier several times...
铁剑居然对这里的魔气也有反应...魏老头，你说这柄剑不会是什么魔剑吧？¤Iron Sword actually reacts to the devilish energy here... Old man Wei, do you think this sword is a devil sword?
魏无极沉默了半晌，应该是在回忆着什么...¤Wei Wuji was silent for a while, he should be remembering something...
一般来说，元婴期修士的魂魄，如果找不到新的躯体夺舍，百年之内就会消散。我能在这柄剑中沉睡一千多年，本就说明了这剑并非凡品。¤Generally speaking, if the soul of a cultivator in the Nascent Soul Stage cannot find a new body, it will dissipate within a hundred years. I can sleep in this sword for more than a thousand years, which means that this sword is extraordinary. Product.
刚刚的异动也许会吸引到其他人的注意，总之还是先离开这里再说吧。¤The change just now may attract other people's attention, so let's get out of here first.
确实有一些零星的回忆闪过，虽然还不是非常清晰...¤There are indeed some sporadic memories flashed by, although not very clear yet...
我能感受到剑中的力量又强大了几分，看来这天魔眼也是你的一次机遇。¤I can feel that the power in the sword has become stronger again. It seems that the Demon Eye is also an opportunity for you.
铁剑突然振动了起来，将魔物周身翻涌的魔气不断吸入。那魔物才被你重创，没能挣扎几下，就彻底消失不见了。¤The iron sword vibrated suddenly, continuously inhaling the demon energy surging around the monster. The monster was hit hard by you, and it disappeared completely without struggling a few times.
这破剑...怎么会？¤This broken sword... how come?
锈渍铁剑突然从你的背后挣脱出来，飞至半空之中，红光大盛，将魔物周身翻涌的魔气不断吸入。那魔才被你重创，没能挣扎几下，就彻底消失不见了。¤The rust-stained iron sword suddenly broke free from your back and flew into the air. The red light was flourishing, and it continued to inhale the demon energy surging around the monster. The demon was hit hard by you, and it disappeared completely without struggling a few times. It's gone.
你真的没动什么手脚？我觉得这剑吸了魔气以后不仅在抖，还沉了许多......我腰都快压折了。¤You really didn't move any hands or feet? I think the sword is not only shaking after inhaling the devilish energy, but also sinking a lot...My waist is almost crushed.
原来如此，我早该想到的...¤That's it, I should have thought of it...
你背后的铁剑微微颤抖，发出一道清脆的剑鸣之声，又将刚刚倒下的魔物吸食了个干净。你感到铁剑的似乎也重了几分...¤The iron sword behind you trembled slightly, making a crisp sound of the sword cry, and sucked up the monster that had just fallen. You feel that the iron sword seems to be heavier...
仙剑也好，魔剑也罢，能为你所用的便是好剑。¤Either the fairy sword or the devil sword, what can be used for you is a good sword.
它又进阶了...如今这柄剑的威能已经不弱于一般的法宝。但我能感觉到它还有更大的潜力！¤It's advanced again... Now the power of this sword is not weaker than the general magic weapon. But I can feel that it has greater potential!
怎么这次变重了这么多？¤Why did it gain so much weight this time?
你这{xiaozi}身娇体弱的，法宝重些不是常事？我能感觉到这柄剑内的能量又强大了不少，说不定再过不久就能够再度进阶了！¤You {xiaozi} are frail and weak. It is not common for you to have more magic weapons? I can feel that the energy in this sword is a lot stronger. Maybe you will be able to advance again soon!
呼...好险，这些魔物真难缠。¤Well... it's dangerous, these monsters are really hard to deal with.
没想到这锈渍斑驳，看着普普通通的破剑居然还颇有来头。老头，有啥办法能让这剑重新恢复成纯阳法宝么？¤Unexpectedly, this rust-stained mottled, looking at the ordinary broken sword actually has quite a background. Old man, is there any way to restore this sword to a pure sun magic weapon?
只见一{SayStcVal=929}向你袭来。¤I saw a {SayStcVal=929} attacking you.
吼！！！¤Roar!!!
尽头之处传来阵阵腥风，看来有妖兽在此地筑巢。¤There was a gust of fishy wind at the end, it seems that a monster is building a nest here.
竟有此事！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤How could this happen!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
当时他啊，别说忘了施展神通攻击，甚至忘了驱使遁术。¤At that time, he ah, not to mention forget to perform divine attacks, and even forget to drive the evasive art.
兴许是吧...¤Perhaps...
连？¤Even?
老头，你怎么一副伤感的样子？¤Old man, why do you look sad?
好吧。不过在出发之前，我这还有要事要向师兄汇报，倪兄帮我转告一番吧。\n¤Okay. But before we leave, I still have important things to report to senior brother here, Ni brother help me to pass on some. \n
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，之前给你发的传音符消息怎么一直没回我呢？这么久没消息，还以为你是闭死关了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, how come I never got back to you from the messenger message I sent to you earlier? So long no news, thought you were closed to death.
不过此次及时阻止了魔道妖人的计划，且天魔道元婴修士损失不少，短时间内应当是再难作什么妖。¤But this time to stop the demons of the demonic plan, and the sky Demon Road YuanYing cultivators lost a lot, a short period of time should be difficult to make what demon.
沿路进入好几个阵法后，倪旭欣带你进入到一间静室之中。¤After entering several formations along the way, Ni XuXin takes you into a quiet room.
是因为诛仙剑的影响么？¤Is it because of the influence of the Immortal Punishing Sword?
阴冥三海的灵魂体可能知道些消息么...¤The soul body of the three seas of the underworld may know something...
你简单的向倪旭欣叙述了事发经过和结局后，后者也是陷入沉思中。¤After you briefly recounted to Ni XuXin what happened and how it ended, the latter was also in deep thought.
所以只能让{FirstName}{xiongdi}去那边跑一趟，试试能否获得更多信息，甚至成功复活魏前辈了。¤So you can only let {FirstName}{xiongdi} run over there and try to see if you can get more information and even successfully resurrect senior Wei.
没想到师兄号称九州第一剑仙，竟还有如此窘迫的时候。¤I didn't expect to see a time when my brother, who is known as the number one sword immortal in Kyushu, would be so embarrassed.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}是在海上发现了什么吗？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}Did you find something at sea?
越过鳞次栉比的武陵城各类建筑，你和炎萧径直向白帝楼而去。¤Crossing over the various types of buildings lined up in Wuling City, you and Yan Xiao headed straight for the White Emperor Building.
见你一脸严肃，倪旭欣也没再说什么，只是在等你继续。¤See your face serious, Ni XuXin also did not say anything else, just waiting for you to continue.
上次南崖城一别后，我奉命前往天魔眼探查是否有异状。但在过程中，与炎萧道友遭到天魔教袭击，后续又在天魔眼破解后者释放其中魔物的计划。¤After the last farewell at South Cliff City, I was ordered to go to the Heavenly Devil's Eye to investigate whether there is a strange situation. However, in the process, Daoist friend Yan Xiao was attacked by the Heavenly Demon Cult, and subsequently cracked the latter's plan to release the demons in it at the Heavenly Demon Eye.
炎萧也没说什么只是点头表示同意。倪旭欣见状便招呼附近的执事为炎萧带路去密室修养。自己则带着你向反方向走去。¤Yan Xiao also did not say anything just nodded his head in agreement. Ni XuXin saw this then greeted the nearby deacon for Yan Xiao led the way to the secret room to recuperate. Himself took you in the opposite direction.
欸，我还没说你怎么就知道了？我还努力保持严肃试图神秘点呢...¤Hey, how did you know before I even said anything? I'm still trying to stay serious trying to be mysterious...
轩儿如今的实力是不同往日了，但...连他自己都说另一处更为危险，我又怎放得下心呢...¤Xuan'er's strength today is different from the old days, but... Even he himself said that the other place is more dangerous, how can I put my mind at ease...
但...这还未谋面，又要置轩儿于险地...唉...¤But... This has not yet met, and to put Xuan'er in danger... I'm sorry...
老夫第一次见到轩儿的时候，他不过是个顽童罢了，整天拿着把木剑到处惹是生非。¤When I first met Xuan's son, he was just an urchin, holding a wooden sword all day long and causing trouble everywhere.
结果误以为自己碰到阴冥蟒，让一条普通的大黑蟒吓到，还被被追了好久。¤As a result, mistakenly thinking that they had encountered the netherworld python, let an ordinary large black python scared, but also was chased for a long time.
想到了些以前的事...¤Thinking of something from before...
魏无极声音渐微，一句话说完终于是没有回应了。¤Wei Wuji voice fading, a sentence finally is no response.
我这两年遵师祖嘱托一直坐镇在白帝楼中，大小事务都有过目，却从未听闻有天魔道的异动。¤I've been sitting in the White Emperor Building for the past two years at the behest of my ancestor, and I've seen all the big and small matters, but I've never heard of any movement of the Heavenly Demon Path.
是的，据师祖去年传来的消息所言，他老人家确实找到了些复活之术的眉头。¤Yes, according to what the message from the Master last year said, his old man did find some frown of the art of resurrection.
唉，我当然高兴。但为了帮我重塑肉身而冒险，不值得。¤Alas, I am certainly happy. But it's not worth the risk to help me reshape my flesh.
我会尽早向师祖汇报的。¤I will report to the master as soon as possible.
在这破剑中呆着也没啥不好...¤There is nothing wrong with staying in this broken sword...
是关于复活魏老的事么？¤Is it about resurrecting Wei Lao?
师祖之前交代此事万不可外泄，所以只得带{FirstName}{xiongdi}来此处了。¤The master explained before the matter must not leak, so only have to bring {FirstName}{xiongdi} to here.
所以师兄是有什么新的发现？¤So what is the new discovery, brother?
一进入白帝楼大门便看到最中心处倪家少爷正在向白帝楼某位执事安排着什么。当然，倪旭欣也适时看到你们俩，如蒙大赦一般，他挥手赶开了执事，急忙走向你。¤As soon as you enter the gate of the White Emperor Building you will see that the young master of the Ni family at the very center is arranging something to a certain deacon of the White Emperor Building. Of course, Ni XuXin also saw the two of you in due course, like a pardon, he waved his hand to drive away the deacon and hurried towards you.
嗯，但玄道宗那边...唉...¤Well, but the Mystic Dao Sect side ... Alas...
其中有两个师祖认为比较靠谱，于是自己先沿着线索追寻可能比较危险的那个，而另一个则打算交给你前往探查。¤Two of them were considered more reliable by the master, so he himself first followed the trail to pursue the one that might be more dangerous, while the other one was intended to be handed over to you to explore.
唔，好像..就这么多了吧？¤Well, it seems... That's all, right?
唉，轩儿那孩子...¤Alas, that child Xuan'er ...
呵，最有意思的还是轩儿练气初期的时候，刚学会些功法便自觉实力强大，于是带着老夫送他的木剑法宝想要出门显摆一番。¤The most interesting thing is that when Xuan's son was at the early stage of Qi training, he had just learned some techniques and felt strong, so he took the wooden sword treasure given to him by the old man and wanted to show off.
但在过程中，与炎萧道友遭到天魔教袭击，后续又在天魔眼破解后者释放其中魔物的计划。¤But in the process, with Yan Xiao Daoist attacked by the Heavenly Demon Cult, followed by the latter's plan to release the demons therein in the Heavenly Demon Eye.
哈哈哈，岂止如此。连...¤Hahaha, not only that. Even ...
嗯，那我就先行离开去做准备了。¤Well, then I will leave first to make preparations.
我这两年遵师祖嘱托一直坐镇在白帝楼中，怎会从未听闻相关的消息！¤I have been sitting in the White Emperor Building for the past two years at the behest of my ancestor, how could I have never heard of the relevant news!
而且{FirstName}{xiongdi}不是经常在海上活动么，所以根据我的推理嘛，大概率就是这样咯...欸，不对么？¤And {FirstName}{xiongdi} is not often at sea, so according to my reasoning, the probability is that this is the case... Hey, isn't that right?
唉...可惜那时的记忆...如今...只剩下些碎片了。¤Alas... It's a pity that the memories of those days... Now... There are only fragments left.
轩儿如今的实力是不同往日了，但...我又怎放得下心呢...¤Xuan's strength is different now, but... I can't let go of my heart...
上次南崖城一别后，我奉命前往天魔眼探查是否有异状。¤After the last South Cliff City farewell, I was ordered to go to the Heavenly Devil's Eye to explore whether there is a strange situation.
不过师祖获得的相关消息也不是太多，只知道传说阴冥海那边有灵魂体出现，这几片海域中更是曾有修士提到过灵魂体复活之法，可惜流传不广，其中信息更是佚失很多。¤But the ancestor did not get too much relevant information, only know that there are legends of the soul body appearing over the netherworld sea, these few seas there are cultivators mentioned the soul body resurrection method, but unfortunately not widely circulated, the information is lost a lot of anonymous.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，之前给你发的传音符消息怎么一直没回我呢？若不是知道你实力强大，还以为你出什么事了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, before sending you a voice talisman message how has not been back to me? If I didn't know you were strong, I would have thought something had happened to you.
倪旭欣显然是认为玄道宗遭难有自己的一部分责任，没有继续这个话题。¤Ni XuXin obviously thought that he was partly responsible for the Mystic Dao Sect being struck and did not continue the topic.
（这一路尽是些遮蔽气息屏蔽神识的阵法，看来倪兄要说的事并非不重要，只是...）¤(This whole journey is full of formations that obscure the breath and shield the soul sense, it seems that what brother Ni is going to say is not unimportant, just...)
好吧，那我休息几日便出海前往阴冥海。¤Well, then I will rest for a few days and go out to the netherworld sea.
不完全是，为何这么问？¤Not exactly, why do you ask?
只是没想到老夫竟有如此福分，本以为余生也就与这破剑为伴了，却还能在千百年后听到自己大弟子的消息。¤I just didn't expect that the old man would be so blessed, I thought I would be with this broken sword for the rest of my life, but I can still hear the news of my eldest disciple after a thousand years.
唔，倒也没那么重要。炎道友貌似受伤不浅，还是先给你找间密室调养一番吧。¤Well, it is not so important. Daoist Yan seems to be injured, it is better to find a secret room for you to recuperate.
魏无极一句话没说完，却是沉默了半晌。¤Wei Wuji did not finish a sentence, but was silent for a long time.
我近几年大部分时间都呆在这白帝楼中听执事的各种汇报嘛，但只是有些平平无奇的小事，都快无聊死了。所以当然不会是跟宁州有关咯。¤I have spent most of the time in recent years in this white emperor building to listen to the deacon's various reports well, but just some ordinary and trivial things, are almost bored to death. So of course it won't be related to Ning Province.
我看炎萧道友似乎受伤不浅，如果没什么要事，不如在白帝楼调养一番再离去。¤I see that Daoist Yan Xiao seems to be injured quite a bit, if there is nothing important, why don't you recuperate in the White Emperor Building before leaving.
到了，我们就在这说吧。¤Here we are, let's talk about it here.
所谓重剑无锋，大巧不工，镇元剑仙一门的《奔雷决》正是我派重剑流的代表功法，传承亦有数千年，对敌时往往能够蓄势以待，后发制人。¤The greatsword has no edge, pure strength overcomes all trickery, Swordmaster Zhengyuan's Charging Thunder Arts is the representative of our sect's greatsword style, and it has been passed down for thousands of years. When confronting the enemy, it bids its time to subdue the enemy in a single strike.
龙阳上人的独门功法唤作《金刚炼体决》，对敌时体内灵气会自动形成灵气护盾保护自身，非常实用。¤Venerable Dragonlight's unique cultivation method is called 《 Diamond Body Refining Art 》. When confronting an enemy, the ki in the body will automatically form a powerful shield, a very practical technique.
好，从今日起你就是我门下的记名弟子了，这件七星剑法器就当作为师给你的见面礼了。希望以后你能勤修仙道，不要弱了我的名头！¤Well, from today you will be a registered disciple of our Sect. This Seven-Star Sword Artifact will be used as a meeting gift to you from your teacher. I hope you can practice the Immortal Dao diligently in the future and don't weaken my reputation!
这些下等魔短期内虽然不足为虑，但若是放任不管，也会带来不少祸端。因此，我们各大门派约定俗成，每隔三十年会打开一次天魔眼外的禁制，令门内弟子前去清缴。¤Although these inferior demons are not a concern in the short term, if they are left unchecked, they will also bring a lot of disasters. Therefore, our various martial arts have agreed to open the restrictions outside the eyes of the gods every 30 years to make disciples inside the door. Go and pay.
明河剑仙乃我派大长老，修为已达元婴期。他的独门功法《神剑决》在整个宁州也是独树一帜，对敌时一往无前，不以剑气伤人，但凡出手皆是杀招。¤Swordmaster Radiant River is the Grand Elder of our Sect, and is a Nascent Soul realm cultivator. His unique technique Divine Sword Arts is one of a kind, peerless in its precision. While he does not use Sword Qi to harm the enemy, each strike is deadly in its own right.
只见一{SayStcVal=929}向你扑来。¤I saw one {SayStcVal=929} pounce at you.
远处一团火焰，飞速靠近。¤A flame in the distance, flying close.
麟尊大人回来了？¤Lord Linzun is back?
（一脸无奈的看着对方）¤(looks at each other with a helpless face)
那徒弟只能恭喜您啦。¤Then I can only congratulate you.
徒儿为师回来啦~¤I'm back!
说罢，一行人并做一道遁光直入麟庙。¤After saying this, the group made a disappearing light and went straight into the Lin Temple.
这个....哈哈哈，先回家，先回家~¤This .... Hahahaha, home first, home first~
嗯~都散了吧。¤Hmmm~ All disperse.
不对，他老人家不是一直在闭关准备....？¤No, hasn't his old man been in retreat preparing for ....?
抬眼望去，半空中漂浮着一人。¤Looking up, there was a man floating in mid-air.
噤声，掌门来了。¤Be silent, the Master is here.
绝焰堂的前辈？这可不多见呢。¤A senior from the Absolute Flame Hall? That's not often seen.
确实，我上次也是在执行麟庙相关的任务之时侥幸遇到，钟长老还指点了我几句。¤Indeed, I also came across it by chance last time when I was on a mission related to the Lin Temple, and Elder Zhong even gave me a few pointers.
啊~~懂了。那近些年辛苦师兄了。¤Ah~~I see. Then it's been hard on you in recent years.
弟子钟焰，恭迎师尊归来。¤My disciple, Zhong Yan, welcomes the return of the Master.
众人：“弟子，恭迎麟尊。”¤All: ''Disciples, welcome His Holiness Lin.''
炎师弟，你莫要取笑我了，哪有那么容易？¤Brother Yan, don't make fun of me, it's not that easy.
孤陋寡闻了吧，这位是绝焰堂大长老，钟焰长老。¤You are ignorant, aren't you? This is the Grand Elder of the Absolute Flame Hall, Elder Zhong Yan.
今天，是家师归来之日。¤Today is the day of the return of the Master of the House.
哈哈哈，为师可是有不少收获呢。¤Hahahaha, I'm getting a lot out of it.
这位前辈是谁啊？¤Who is this senior?
钟师兄，怎么今天这么有兴致啊。可是修为又有精进？¤Brother Zhong, why are you so enthusiastic today? But your cultivation has improved again?
若是心境不稳，便会被这煞气侵蚀内心，需得多多注意。¤If you feel unstable, you will be eroded by this evil spirit, and you need to pay more attention.
如此看来...此魔物似乎是以煞气结成，与天魔眼中的魔物又有所不同。¤In this way... this monster seems to be formed with evil spirits, which is different from the monster in the eyes of the demon.
与这魔物对敌之时晕眩感甚是强烈，这到底是什么东西？¤When confronted with this monster, I felt very dizzy. What is this?
{shidi}，这功法没有绝对的好坏之分，只看是否合适。我建议你在成为内门弟子，拜入我派长老门下以后，再根据你学到的功法，来藏经阁挑选能够搭配上的秘籍。¤{shidi}, there is no absolute difference between good and bad practice, just to see whether it is appropriate. I suggest that you become an inner disciple and worship under my elders, and then come to Tibetan scriptures according to the practice you have learned. Ge chooses the cheats that can be matched.
有一些问题想向师兄请教。¤I have some questions I want to ask my brother.
{shidi}初来乍到，作为师兄我便私下赠与你一些沧元丹，你可小心切莫被长老知晓。¤{shidi} just arrived, as a senior, I will give you some Cangyuan Pill in private, you can be careful not to be known by the elders.
哈哈，宗门内的资源可不能用灵石换取，只有对宗门做出贡献的弟子才有资格在藏经阁与神兵阁兑换功法及法器，而这沧元丹正是弟子们贡献度的体现。¤Haha, the resources in the sect cannot be exchanged for spirit stones. Only the disciples who have contributed to the sect are eligible to exchange exercises and artifacts in the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion and the Shenbing Pavilion, and this Cang Yuan Dan is the disciple. The embodiment of our contribution.
门派内大部分的基础法术和功法都可以请教传功长老，若是你成为内门弟子，拜入我派任意一名长老门下，自然也能够学到这一脉的所有法术和功法。¤Most of the basic spells and exercises in the sect can be consulted by the elders. If you become an inner disciple and come to any elder of our sect, you will naturally be able to learn all the spells and exercises in this vein.
{shidi}，有什么事么？¤{shidi}, what's the matter?
见过师叔。¤Greetings Martial Uncle.
见过{shixiong}。¤I have seen {shixiong}.
宗门广场上的{color=#d0380a}告示{/color}栏每隔一段时间会发放宗门任务，{shidi}完成任务后便可获得沧元丹。¤The {color=#d0380a}notice{/color}board on the clan square will issue sect commissions at regular intervals, {shidi} will receive Cang Yuan Dan upon completion.
上次那场是我肚子疼，做不得数。¤The last time I had a stomachache, it was uncountable.
来来来，陪你倪爷爷过上两招。¤Come, come, accompany you Grandpa Ni through two tricks.
不知何时，一道矮小的人影出现在这邪教妖人的背后。¤At some point, a short figure appeared behind this cult demon.
也不知这位前辈为何助我，算了，我还是速速回宗门汇报吧。¤I don't know why this senior is helping me. Forget it, I'd better report back to the clan quickly.
掌控一方空间，这是化神修士方有的手段。¤To control a side of space is a means only available to Deity Transformation cultivators.
呦，传送符不错嘛~¤Yo, nice teleportation charm~
行了，人我带走了，你回去复命吧。¤All right, I'll take the man with me, go back and resume your duties.
嗯，我还是速速回宗门汇报吧。¤Well, I'd better report back to the clan quickly.
你{xiaozi}怎么这么菜啊？都金丹了连个元婴都打不过，还要麻烦我老人家。¤Why are you {xiaozi} such a rookie? You're already a Jindan and you can't even beat a YuanYing, so you have to bother my old man.
小心。{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Caution. {vpunch=10,0.5}
对方手掐法诀一柄飞剑直刺你而来，之后就捏碎一块玉符引起一阵空间扭曲。¤A flying sword stabs you straight in the face, after which you crush a jade talisman causing a spatial distortion.
之后这方空间仿若凝固一般，不仅那传送符的空间波动消散了，飞剑更是定在空中。¤Not only did the spatial fluctuations of the teleportation talisman dissipate, but the flying sword was even fixed in the air.
这古神教也是看得起你了，竟然出动了元婴修士。不过你这一路上独来独往却也能被这人盯上，此事看来也不简单啊。¤This Ancient God Sect is also looking up to you, going so far as to send out a YuanYing cultivator. But you've been alone on this journey and yet you've been targeted by this person, this matter seems to be not simple either.
看招！！¤Watch the move!!!
巧了，我也想问你几个问题。¤Coincidentally, I would also like to ask you a few questions.
嘿嘿，咱有缘再见。¤Hey, hey, we'll see you sometime.
来人还顺手收取了空中的飞剑。¤The visitor also collected the flying sword in the air by hand.
你能感觉暗中有一道神识一直关注此地，不过在你击毙了这邪教妖人就撤去了。¤You can feel a soul sense in the shadows keeping an eye on this place, but it withdrew after you killed the evil demon.
嘿嘿，{xiaozi}还是跟我走一趟吧，咱也不过是想问几个问题。¤Hey, {xiaozi} better come with me, we just want to ask a few questions too.
此地已被部下阵法，你左冲右撞难以拖出。¤This place has been set up by the Ministry, and you will have difficulty dragging yourself out of it by dashing left and right.
浪方大圣体长愈千米，你被一股腐蚀性的灵气裹挟着吸入它的食道，拼尽全力也堪堪能抵挡肉身不被腐蚀。¤The Langfang Sacred Body is more than a thousand meters long, and you are wrapped in a corrosive aura and sucked into its esophagus, and you can resist the fleshy body from being corroded with all your strength.
“砰”的一声，你被震飞出去，撞上了浪方的胃壁，整个人都被吸附在上面，动弹不得。¤With a bang, you were knocked out and hit Lang Fang's stomach wall. Your whole body was stuck on it, unable to move.
小心，这些肉壁上的液体的腐蚀性很强，如果不及时运转灵气护体，你的肉身会很快被腐蚀烂掉！¤Be careful, the liquid on these flesh walls is very corrosive. If you don't run the aura shield in time, your flesh will be corroded quickly!
你将灵力汇聚于双眸之中，总算能在一片漆黑中看清自己所处的环境。这是一片巨大而空旷的空间，四周都是鲜红色的肉壁，散发着一股浓烈的腐蚀气味。¤You gather spiritual power in your eyes, and you can finally see your environment clearly in the darkness. This is a huge and empty space, surrounded by bright red flesh walls, exuding a strong corrosive smell.
残卷中，你赫然发现了一个写满有关火麒麟动向的玉简。¤Amongst the remnants of the scroll, you hasten to find a jade slip filled with information about the movements of the Fire Qilin.
你瞬间反应过来，一招便彻底了结了他，¤You react instantly and finish him off for good with a single move that
你将神识探入那受损的储物袋，希望在剩余的残卷中寻找到些许线索。¤You probe your soul sense into that damaged storage pouch, hoping to find some clues in the remaining remnants of the scroll.
你又走上前去查看那名黑衣人的尸首，却只在他的腰间找到了一块黑色的令牌。¤You walk up again to examine the black-clad man's corpse, but only find a black token around his waist.
眼见不是对手，他使出最后一丝灵力，烧向自己的储物袋。¤Seeing that he was no match, he used his last ounce of spiritual energy and burned towards his storage bag.
不好。¤Not Good.
并且，这份记录竟从数百年前就开始了！¤And, this record goes back hundreds of years!
似乎是某种信物...总之，先收着吧。¤It seems to be some kind of token... Anyway, keep it for now.
从为火麒麟采购的药材，到向各路长老打听到的消息，麟庙周边灵气波动与变化。还详细地分析了火麒麟伤势恢复状况，渡劫的准备情况以及大致的飞升时间等问题。¤From the medicinal herbs procured for the Fire Qilin, to the information gathered from the various elders, the fluctuations and changes in spiritual energy around the Lin Temple. There is also a detailed analysis of issues such as the recovery status of the Fire Qilin's injuries, preparations for the tribulation and the approximate time of ascension.
古神教竟然对火麒麟有所图谋…他们到底想做什么呢...¤The Ancient Gods Sect actually has plans for the Fire Qilin...what exactly do they want to do...
此人所用应该是古神教的招式...只可惜这储物袋内的东西已经被烧的七七八八了…¤This person should be using the Ancient God Sect's moves... It's just a pity that the contents of this storage bag have been burned to the ground...
如我所料不错，你便是枯木老祖吧？¤As I expected, you are the Old Man of Deadwood, right?
这遁术着实诡异，你一时竟也追不上他，只得先跟了上去。¤This is really weird, you can't catch up with him for a while, you just have to follow it first.
对你的质问他并没有理会，反倒是使出了一种奇异的遁术，一路向{color=#d0380a}东{/color}跑了过去。¤He paid no attention to your questioning, but instead used a bizarre evasive technique and ran all the way {color=#d0380a} east{/color}.
久闻不如一见，想必你便是枯木师兄罢？¤I've heard so much about you, but I'm sure you're Brother Deadwood?
哼，邪魔外道，不过如此。¤Hmph, the evil one is nothing more than that.
这魔道修士为何会出现在你的洞府里，是否应该给个解释？¤Should there be an explanation as to why this devilish cultivator is in your cave?
还没来得及缓过神来，一道人影慌忙逃出，奔向洞府的入口。¤Before he had time to slow down, a figure fled in a panic and ran towards the entrance of the cave.
只是这魔道修士为何会出现在你的洞府里，是否应该给个解释再走？¤Just why is this devilish cultivator in your cave, should you give an explanation before you leave?
这遁术虽快，但你要追上也并非难事。不过看他似乎还留有什么后手的样子，便决定先跟上去看看。¤This vanisher is fast, but it is not difficult for you to catch up. But seeing as he seemed to have left something behind, I decided to follow him first and see.
魔道余孽，还想跑？¤Remnants of the Devil's Way, still want to run?
你不一会便追上了那人，但那人却穿着竹山宗长老的服饰，浑身上下也不见魔气的踪影，实力也只有金丹水准。¤You catch up with the man in no time, but the man is wearing the costume of an elder of the Bamboo Mountain Sect, and there is no trace of demonic Qi all over his body, and his strength is only at Jindan level.
很多法器威力强大，代价却也不小。¤Many magical instruments are powerful, but the price is not small.
眼前是一处火山口，其上漂浮着一枚火红色的晶石。¤In front of you is a volcanic crater with a fiery red crystal floating on it.
破坏了会恢复....可以在一个空间感受到另一个空间的情况....基本对称的空间...难道？¤If it is destroyed, it will be restored... You can feel the situation in one space in another space... Basically symmetrical space... Is it?
你破除了阵法核心，却发现它闪耀了一会后，居然又恢复了原状。¤You got rid of the core of the formation, only to find that it shined for a while, but it was restored to its original state.
难道什么啊，{FirstName}{xiongdi}你快想想怎么办啊。¤What's the matter, {FirstName}{xiongdi}, think about what to do.
好，{FirstName}{xiongdi}那我们快上吧。¤Okay, {FirstName}{xiongdi} then let's get on.
倪兄别急，我估计是两个核心要一起击破才行。看来我们要配合一下了。¤Brother Ni, don't worry, I guess the two cores need to be broken together. It seems we need to cooperate.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我这边的阵法核心怎么又恢复了？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, how come the core of my formation has recovered?
咳咳...没想到这方壶山卧虎藏龙，先撤吧。¤Ahem... I didn't expect this Fang Hushan Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, let's withdraw first.
本座来试试道友的手段。¤I'm here to try the methods of fellow daoists.
此人是驻守此地的金丹长老，我若是胜了，也不要伤他性命，免得和竹山宗结下大仇。¤This person is the Golden Core elder who is stationed here. If I win, don't hurt his life, lest I forge a big feud with Bamboo Mountain Sect.
这{$name}据说是当年创立沂山派的老祖，早年间为躲避仇家去了海外，如今再回宁州后已有了元婴期修为。¤This {$name} is said to be the old ancestor who founded the Yishan School back in the day. He went overseas to escape his enemies in the early years, but has now returned to Ning Province with a YuanYing stage cultivation.
你要接取{$name}的悬赏？¤Do you want to pick up a bounty for {$name}?
这{$name}在天魔道中也是极有威名的元婴长老，此番来宁州应该也是多有图谋。¤This {$name} is also an extremely prestigious YuanYing elder in the Heavenly Demon Dao, and this time he should also have more than one plan to come to Ning Province.
有何不妥？¤What's wrong with that?
接取此悬赏需要先支付{$yajin}灵石作为抵押，这个悬赏的最晚的完成期限是{$X}年，若在此期间内无法完成悬赏任务，这些灵石将不予退还。¤This reward requires the payment of {$yajin} spirit stones as collateral. The latest time limit for completion of this reward is {$X} years, and if the reward cannot be completed within this period, these spirit stones will not be refunded.
总之，这{$level}阶悬赏以你的实力来说{$miaoshu}，确定要接取这个悬赏么？¤Anyway, this {$level} rank bounty is {$miaoshu} for your strength, are you sure you want to take this bounty?
琚运琦为一己私利谋害公孙璞长老，风雨楼必不饶他。¤If Ju Yunqi had plotted against Elder Gongsun Pu for his own personal gain, Rain and Rain House would not spare him.
{$level}阶悬赏，目标是{$name}，以你的实力来说{$miaoshu}。确定要接取这个悬赏么？¤{$level} rank bounty, targeting {$name}, for your strength {$miaoshu}. Sure you want to take up this bounty?
如今风雨楼中，无论以威望还是实力论，都没有比你更适合接取这个悬赏的人了。¤Nowadays, in terms of prestige and strength, there is no one more suitable than you to take up this bounty in the Rain or Shine Tower.
确定要接取这个悬赏么？¤Are you sure you want to take up this reward?
听灵儿所说，道友似是在寻找天道果，此物我虽然没有，但是这枯龙藤也有此效，此番就赠与道友了。¤From what Ling'er has said, it seems that you are looking for the Fruit of the Heavenly Dao. Although I do not have this item, this Dead Dragon Vine also has this effect, so I will give it to you.
这是万鳞甲？传闻中这是万千水族献出自身最坚硬的鳞片所制成的。¤This is the Ten Thousand Scales Armour? Rumour has it that it is made from the hardest scales of thousands of aquatic beings who have offered themselves.
{FirstName}供奉飞升如此盛事，我龙族自然不会错过。届时我与敖灵定会前来为{FirstName}供奉护法。¤Guest Elder {FirstName}'s ascension is such a grand occasion, and my dragon clan will not miss it. Ao Ling and I will definitely come to guard Guest Elder {FirstName} at that time.
这是九玄大圣的传功龙鳞？¤Is this the dragon scale of the Nine Profound Great Sage?
你将所见所闻与之相告，并归还了龙鳞。¤You told him what you saw and heard, and returned the dragon scales.
道友此行可有新的发现？¤Do you have any new discoveries in this trip?
对了，这龙鳞的其中奥义等我龙族解析出来，就会由乾龙阁煮海长老分享给道友。¤By the way, the profound meaning of this dragon scale will be shared with fellow daoists by the elders of Qianlongge Cooking Sea when my dragon clan parses it out.
九龙玺乃是龙皇象征在上古之战中遗失，道友帮我龙族寻回至宝，多谢道友了！¤The Nine Dragon Seals are the symbol of the Dragon Emperor lost in the ancient battles, so thank you for helping my Dragon Clan recover the most precious treasure!
你将所见所闻与之相告。¤You tell it what you see and hear.
嗯，我了解了。多谢道友。这几只龙皇果你就收下吧。¤Well, I see. Thank you buddy. Just accept these Dragon King Fruits.
我个人为感谢道友，还略备一份薄礼。还望道友不要嫌弃。¤Personally, in order to thank fellow Daoists, I also prepared a small gift. I hope fellow Daoists don't dislike it.
恕不远送。¤No delivery.
多谢道友助我龙族寻回秘法，这株龙血草还望道友收下。¤Thank you for helping the Dragon Clan recover our secret technique, I hope you will accept this Dragon Blood Grass.
道友成为我龙族供奉之事，我龙族会告知各海阁下是我龙族的盟友。¤Daoist friends become the Guest Elder of our dragon family, and our dragon family will inform you that your Excellency Gehai is an ally of our dragon family.
不知道友可否愿意？¤I don't know if a friend would like it?
不论如何，道友帮我龙族寻回至宝不该说这丧气话，多谢道友了！¤No matter what, you shouldn't say such demoralizing things to help my Dragon Clan recover the most precious treasure, thank you very much!
道友若是有了新想法可以随时来找我。¤If you have a new idea, you can come to me at any time.
以道友对我 龙族所做出的贡献，现在还不足以成为我龙族供奉。¤The contributions made by fellow Daoists to our dragon family are not enough to be a Guest Elder of our dragon family.
这龙血草就赠与道友了。¤This Dragon's Blood Grass is presented to you, Fellow Daoist.
以道友对我龙族所做出的贡献，现在足以成为我龙族供奉了。¤With the contributions made by fellow Daoists to our dragon clan, it is now enough to be a Guest Elder of our dragon clan.
唉，现在我龙族没落再也没有万族来朝了。¤Alas, now that my dragon tribe has fallen no longer has all the tribes coming to it.
白鹿师叔且慢，此番是晚辈们实力不济，若是能避免灭门的局面，还不劳烦您出面解决。¤If we could have avoided the extermination of the clan, we would not have had to ask you to step in to solve the problem.
金虹剑派掌门见白鹿真人虽未答复，但也没有动手的架势，于是便转向你。¤When the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect's master saw that the White Deer realm had not replied but was not in a position to make a move, he turned to you.
不如，我大胆做主，借金虹秘传神通及功法与前辈一观。而前辈也只需放过金虹剑派一马即可。¤Why don't I take the liberty of borrowing the secret divine power and techniques of the Golden Rainbow and show them to you? And senior will only have to let the Golden Rainbow Sword School off the hook.
即便是面对化神强者，即便是面对道的压迫，又何惧之有！¤Even in the face of a strong Deity Transformation, even in the face of the oppression of the Dao, there is nothing to fear!
不如，我大胆做主，借金虹秘传神通及功法与前辈一观。而道友也只需事后转身离开即可，何必与冒险与白鹿师叔一战呢？¤How about I boldly take the lead and borrow the Golden Rainbow secret divine ability and gongfu with senior for a look. And all you need to do is turn around and leave afterwards, so why risk a battle with Senior White Deer?
随着他的走近，你能感到自己的神识探查范围迅速缩小，外界的灵气也随之不再回应。这已然不是你所面对过的任何一种强者威压，而是来自这一方天地，或者说是来自道的极致压迫。¤As he approaches, you can feel that the scope of your soul sense detection is rapidly shrinking, and the aura of the outside world will no longer respond. This is no longer any kind of strong pressure you have faced, but from This side of heaven and earth, or the extreme oppression from Tao.
你正欲动手毁灭{$shili}山门时，却突然发现{$shili}广场上不知何时多了一人。¤When you were about to destroy the gate of {$shili}, you suddenly found that there was an extra person in {$shili} square at some point.
师叔，前辈，且慢！请听我一言！¤Uncle, senior, hold on! Please listen to me!
这{$shili}，从今天开始便在宁州除名吧。¤This {$shili} will be removed from Ning Province starting today.
住手。¤Stop.
正在你跃跃欲试之时，一旁的金虹剑派掌门却急匆匆的走上前来，拦在你和白鹿真人的中间。¤As you leap to your feet, the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect's Sect Leader hurries up to the side and stops between you and the real White Deer.
前辈，若真是展开化神领域与白鹿师叔一战，于你而言也没有实质性的好处，更不用说此举会引起宁州其他化神的注意。¤Senior, if you really unfolded your Deity Transformation domain and fought with Master Bai Lu, there would be no substantial benefits for you, not to mention that this move would attract the attention of other Deity Transformation in Ning Province.
见你同意，金虹剑派掌门终于是松了一口气，赶忙命人为你在前领路。¤Seeing that you agree, the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect leader is finally relieved and hurries to order someone to lead the way for you ahead.
呵，原来多年前白鹿真人寿终正寝的消息不过是幌子，顺利晋升为化神大能才是真相。¤Heh, it turns out that the news that the real White Deer had died at the end of his life many years ago was just a front, and his smooth promotion to a Deity Transformation power was the truth.
呵，我又怎会惧你？¤Heh, how can I fear you?
前辈虽然很强，但面对多个化神修士围攻，只怕也难以讨好。又何须为没有实质好处的事提前天劫到来呢？¤Although the senior is very strong, I am afraid that it will be difficult to please him even when he is surrounded by multiple Deity Transformation cultivators. And why advance the arrival of the heavenly tribulation for something that has no substantial benefit?
见你和白鹿真人虽尚未动手，但气势也愈发恐怖，这元婴期的掌门也只好硬着头皮赶忙继续说下去，不隔秒忽。¤Seeing that you and the White Deer real person have not yet made a move, but the aura is also becoming more and more terrifying, this YuanYing stage master also had to stiffen his head and rush to continue, without intermittent seconds of neglect.
你...竟是白鹿真人！¤You... It's the White Deer!
他顿了一顿，望向白鹿真人那边，似乎是在用神识交流。待白鹿真人点头后方才继续说下去。¤He paused and looked over at Real White Deer, as if he was communicating with his soul sense. Only after the White Deer Reality nodded did he continue.
你虽看不出他的心思，但击溃金虹剑派的护宗大阵后，你正信心十足！¤You can't read his mind, but you are gaining confidence after defeating the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect's great sect protection formation!
道友竟能破我护宗大阵，实力确是非凡，但先不说我金虹剑派有白鹿师叔坐镇，即便是让道友真灭了金虹剑派满门也没什么实质的好处。¤But let's not talk about the fact that the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect has Uncle Bai Lu sitting in the town, even if we let you destroy the entire Golden Rainbow Sword Sect, there is no real benefit.
但{$shili}的其他修士却像是没有看到这人一般，只是一脸惊恐的盯着你。直到这人开始向你缓步走来，你才不自主的将注意力集中在他身上，无暇再留意其他修士。¤But the other cultivators in {$shili} didn't seem to see this person, they just stared at you in horror. Until this person started walking towards you, you couldn't help focusing on him. I don’t have time to pay attention to other cultivators anymore.
但白鹿真人并没有回应你，甚至未有所动作，在离你不过百十步的位置站定，像是在思考着什么似的。¤But the White Deer does not respond to you, or even move, standing still at a distance of only a hundred or ten paces from you, as if he were thinking about something.
离开金虹，否则，你我将以领域之力对决。¤Leave the Golden Rainbow, or you and I will face off with the power of the realm.
...实验结果...损失惨重...重要进展...¤...experimental results...heavy losses...important progress...
看来这个阵法恐怕已经废弃多年了，能量早就消散殆尽。¤It seems that this formation may have been abandoned for many years, and the energy has long since dissipated.
你无意中踩到了一块黑色的石板，地面周围顿时闪起了黑光，俨然是一座陷阱阵法。¤You accidentally stepped on a black slate, and black light flashed around the ground, like a trap formation.
魔神蛊？这不是衡州古神教的秘术么，莫非这里从前是古神教的实验基地？¤Demon God Gu? Isn't this the secret technique of Hengzhou Ancient God Cult? Could it be that this place used to be the experimental base of Ancient God Cult?
鲲族修炼到一定境界时，就可能领悟上古神兽鲲鹏之吞噬秘术，能够吞噬方圆百里内的灵气与一切其它活物，直接消化吸收它们的灵力...¤When the Kun people cultivate to a certain level, they may comprehend the secret art of devouring the ancient divine beast Kunpeng, which can devour the spiritual energy and all other living creatures within a hundred miles, and directly digest and absorb their spiritual power...
你虽然心中感到疑惑，但确实无法找到更多的线索，只能离开了这里...¤Although you have doubts in your heart, you really can't find more clues, you can only leave here...
玉简的内容是残缺的，找不到其它能读懂的内容了。¤The content of the jade slip is incomplete, and there is no other content that can be read.
若能辅以神识威压...成功率...大可提升...¤If it can be supplemented by the coercion of soul sense... the success rate... can be greatly improved...
上古神兽之血脉仍在某些妖兽的体内残存，妖兽所修炼的境界越高，血脉觉醒越多，甚至能够领悟上古神兽的部分神通...¤The bloodlines of ancient divine beasts still linger in the bodies of some monsters. The higher the level of cultivation by the monsters, the more the bloodline awakens, and they can even comprehend some of the magical powers of the ancient divine beasts...
你仔细搜索了一番，只找到了几本残缺的记事玉简。¤You searched carefully, only to find a few incomplete notes on jade slips.
不错，而且这里既然留有阵法，那一定是为了保护或者掩盖什么东西。既然这里已经废弃多年了，说不定还能发现一些有用的宝贝...¤Yes, and since there is a formation here, it must be to protect or cover up something. Since it has been abandoned for many years, maybe some useful treasures can be found...
妖兽境界不得大于金丹期...¤The realm of monsters must not be greater than the Jindan period...
你瞬间警觉了起来，但那黑光闪动了两下便消失了，什么事情都没有发生...¤You instantly became alert, but the black light flashed twice and then disappeared, nothing happened...
你顺着阵法下方的入口走进一个地下洞窟。洞窟内空荡荡的，除了几张坐台和石桌外，还有一个已经腐朽倒塌的书架。¤You follow the entrance below the formation into an underground cave. The cave was empty, except for a few seats and stone tables, and a bookshelf that had collapsed.
要查看哪个玉简呢？¤Which jade slip do you want to check?
...与我教神通颇为相似...若能掌握...¤...similar to my teaching of supernatural powers...if you can master it...
...施展吞噬秘术后，往往需要闭关沉睡数百年，方可完全消化吸收...¤...After using the phagocytic secret, it is often necessary to retreat and sleep for hundreds of years before it can be fully digested and absorbed...
利用魔神蛊控制妖兽的实验结果...¤The experimental results of using the devil to control monsters...
目前已证拥有血脉传承的妖兽...鲲族，龙族，火麒麟，吞云蟒...¤At present, the monsters that have been proved to have blood inheritance... Kun Clan, Dragon Clan, Fire Qilin, Cloud Swallowing Python...
罢了。这都过了一万年，有没有人记得我都是两说之事…¤That's all. It's been 10,000 years, whether anyone remembers me are two things to say ...
道友有所不知，此冥河水母修的乃是神识之体，如今提升境界最快的方法便是吞噬魂体。¤Daoist friends do not know, this placid river jellyfish repair is the body of divine consciousness, now the fastest way to enhance the realm is to devour the soul body.
就算有人记得我，又怎么相信这种事情呢？¤Even if someone remembers me, how can they believe in such things?
依你所说，为你一人修炼便是要牺牲无数生命，岂非与邪修无异？¤According to you, to cultivate for you alone is to sacrifice countless lives, is it not the same as an evil cultivator?
本是如此，但这水母之躯资质极低，光是闭关修炼至元婴期，就已耗费了数千年。¤This is true, but the qualifications of this water mother's body are extremely low, and it has taken thousands of years just to close the door and cultivate to the genesis stage.
鹤真人将破解迷阵之法告知了你。按照鹤真人说的方法，不一会你便进入了洞府。¤The real crane will tell you the method to break the maze. According to the method that the crane real person said, in no time you entered the cave.
鹤真人¤Crane
这…若道友需要，我可帮前辈联系碎星商会。届时定会有人助前辈重归人形。¤This...if you need it, I can help you contact the Shattered Star Merchant Guild. At that time, someone will certainly help senior return to human form.
…若是换作我来，的确也没有更好的办法。¤...If it were up to me, there would indeed be no better way.
你不是妖兽？你是谁？¤You are not a Spirit Beast? Who are you?
我本在海上游历，打听到有妖兽伤人之事，自然要除魔卫道。¤I was originally traveling on the sea, and I heard about a Spirit Beast hurting people, so naturally I had to get rid of the demon and defend the way.
阁下以为，这魂体与人是何关系？¤What do you think, your Excellency, is the relationship between this soul body and a human being?
渡劫前，我修炼的洞府便在这附近。洞府外有迷阵防御，若没有我指点，几乎不可能找到。¤The cave where I trained before the tribulation is near here. The cave was defended by a maze formation outside, so without my guidance, it was almost impossible to find it.
况且若是交换立场，道友可愿一辈子呆在这水母之中？¤If we exchange positions, would you like to stay in this jellyfish for the rest of your life?
鹤真人顿了一下。¤Real Crane paused for a moment.
…当初本已做好万全准备…¤...had been prepared for everything...
是天道对我的压制？还是此地不适合渡劫？又或是有人从中作梗？我至今都不得而知。¤Is the Heavenly Dao suppressing me? Or is this place unsuitable for the tribulation? Or is there someone else who is trying to get in the way? I still don't know.
…这天劫当真如此恐怖？竟连阁下都无法渡过？¤...Is this heavenly tribulation really so terrifying? Even your Excellency could not overcome it?
呵呵，道友能理解自然是极好。不过我却有一个问题想请教道友。¤Oh, you can understand naturally is very good. But I have a question to ask you.
阁下既然是修士，为何要吞噬往来的魂体？¤If you are a cultivator, why do you want to devour the souls of those who come and go?
它身形突然爆退，很快便脱离了开来。¤Its body suddenly burst back, and soon broke away.
而且…我堂堂鹤真人，若是这一关都需要外人帮助，以后还谈何飞升？¤Moreover... I am a true crane, if I need the help of outsiders at this level, how can I talk about ascension in the future?
碎星商会现在由吴、唐、白三家共同掌管，此前我也与一名使用飞针的唐家修士……¤The Shattered Star Merchant Guild is now jointly run by the Wu, Tang and Bai families, and previously I also worked with a Tang family cultivator who used flying needles ......
碎星商会乃是三大商会之一，无尽之海上人尽皆知的存在。¤The Shattered Star Merchant Guild is one of the three major chambers of commerce, an existence known to all on the Endless Sea.
一个声音直接在你脑海中响起。¤A voice rings out directly in your head.
敢问碎星商会可还尚在？¤Dare I ask if the Shattered Star Merchant Guild is still in existence?
原来如此…那便谢过道友了。¤So that's how it is...thank you then, fellow Daoist.
死人自然不能算作人。¤The dead naturally cannot be considered as human beings.
这…具体情况，我也不太清楚。¤This ... the specifics, I'm not too sure.
纵然是修炼需要，可有必要这样屠戮灵魂？闭关修炼又何尝不可？¤Even though it is necessary for cultivation, is it necessary to slaughter the soul like this? Why not close the door and cultivate?
好，好，好……¤Good, good, good ......
你叹了口气，一时也想不到什么话可以安慰他，便也愣在了原地。¤You sighed, and for a moment could not think of any words to comfort him, so also froze in place.
在下道号鹤真人。因渡劫失败，肉身被毁，情急之下钻入了这只冥河水母中。¤My daoist name is Crane. Due to the failure of the tribulation, the flesh was destroyed, in an emergency into the river jellyfish.
…既然道友与我颇有缘分，便送给道友一个机缘罢。¤...Since you and I have a lot of fate, I will give you a chance.
那声音消失了一阵，好似在思考些什么。¤The voice disappeared for a while, as if it was thinking about something.
其实这碎星商会，正是老夫当年所创。¤In fact, this Star Shattering Merchant Guild is exactly what I created back then.
此话一出，你能感受到紧张的氛围有所缓和。¤This statement, you can feel the tense atmosphere has eased.
此地便是我洞府之所在。若非仔细探查，就算寻常元婴期修士来此，也发现不了什么端倪。¤This place is where my cave is located. If not carefully probed, even ordinary YuanYing stage cultivators come here, also can not find any clues.
可如今，碎星商会人尽皆知，老夫却在这水母之中徘徊了万余年…¤But now, everyone in the Shattered Star Chamber knows about it, but I've been wandering in this jellyfish for more than 10,000 years...
道友的意思是，若换做是你，便愿意一辈子呆在这水母之中？¤Do you mean that if it were you, you would be willing to stay in this jellyfish for the rest of your life?
此后再闭关修炼，修为更是难有寸进。近百年来吸取魂体修炼，实乃无奈之举。¤Since then and then closed cultivation, cultivation is difficult to make progress. Nearly a hundred years to draw on the soul body cultivation, it is helpless.
不然，邪修大多都是草菅人命之辈，与我如何相提并论？¤Otherwise, most of the evil cultivators are people who kill people, and how can I compare?
呵…真当是世事无常。¤What's the matter with you?
因为这迷阵只能由修士之躯解开…真当是作阵自阻了。¤Because this maze can only be unlocked by the body of a cultivator...it really is considered as making a formation to block itself.
渡劫的丹药秘术已准备妥当，也寻到一处灵气充裕之地。¤The Pill secret technique for the transition has been prepared, and a place with abundant spiritual energy has also been found.
若这副躯体升至化神境界，我便有机会借此躯体重获新生。¤If this body rises to the Deity Transformation realm, I will have the opportunity to use this body to regain my life.
那…碎星商会如今是何家族掌管？可还有使用飞针的修士？¤That ... broken star Merchant Guild is now in charge of what family? I'm not sure if there are still any cultivators who use flying needles?
魂体如何不算是人？只要复活希望尚在，便由不得你滥杀无辜。¤How is a soul body not considered a human being? As long as the hope of resurrection is still alive, you will not be allowed to kill the innocent indiscriminately.
言罢，鹤真人便带领你前往海底，找到一处极为偏僻的角落。¤After the words, the crane real then led you to the bottom of the sea and found an extremely remote corner.
敢问道友是何人？为何要与我为敌？¤May I ask who you are? Why do you want to be my enemy?
说完，你们不约而同地沉默了，良久…¤After saying that, you were uncharacteristically silent for a long time...
…如此，你为何不亲自回去一趟？¤...In that case, why don't you go back there yourself?
你将生死比试的事情一五一十地说了出来，那声音也随之消失了一阵，好似在思考些什么。¤You told him everything about the life and death competition, and the voice disappeared for a while, as if he was thinking about something.
无论你有何种理由，草菅人命便是错。¤No matter what reason you have, it is wrong to take a life.
但雷劫到来的时候，却比我此前了解到的要强得多…¤But when the thunderstorm came, it was much stronger than what I had previously learned...
神秘声音：道友，暂且收手吧。我们之间好像并没有什么不可调和的恩怨。¤Mysterious Voice: Fellow Daoist, just stop for now. There doesn't seem to be any irreconcilable grudges between us.
我受阴魂岛岛主所托，前来剿灭幽厄。¤I was entrusted by the master of the Island of the Yin Soul to come and eliminate the ghostly eras.
不必狡辩了，出手罢。¤There's no need to argue, let's strike.
道友与碎星商想必是有什么联系吧？¤Daoist friends and broken star merchants must have some connection, right?
若是道友未见得能做的更好，那么老夫如此，于情于理便都没有问题。¤If you have not seen the daoist can do better, then the old man so, in the sense that there will be no problem.
你想了想这其中的关联，便大致猜想到了其中原委。¤You think about the connection, you can roughly guess the original reason.
只见那只冥河水母蓝光大盛，一股强大的威压迎面袭来，赫然已经达到了化神强度。¤Just see that the underworld jellyfish blue light, a powerful pressure to meet the face, he has reached the Deity Transformation strength.
你且……¤You and ......
洞府中有一只白狐，你且告诉它我的情况，让它前来寻我。剩下的东西，便全归道友所得。¤There is a white fox in the cave, so tell it about me and let it come and find me. The rest of the things, then all of you get.
这是......？¤this is......?
想来这便是发出符剑的人，你赶忙上前查看她的伤势。¤If you want to come, this is the one who issued the rune sword. You hurried forward to check her injuries.
或许是举办天下仙道会的缘故，逸风城大街小巷随处可见筑基期修士。¤Perhaps because of the holding of the World Fairy Road Association, the foundation-building cultivators can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys of Yifengcheng.
{color=#d0380a}魔修{/color}...金...害...我......¤{color=#d0380a}evil cultivator{/color}...Gold...Hurt...I...
八成是什么谋财害命的新套路。¤80% is a new way of making money and killing lives.
果然是魔修所为，传闻魔修功法诡谲，嗜血如麻。我一小小修士，还是避而远之为上。¤Sure enough, it is the work of the evil cultivators. It is said that the evil cultivators's technique is tricky and bloodthirsty. I am just a little cultivator, it's better to stay away.
筋脉尽断，神仙难救。道友可还有什么心愿未了，在下将尽力而为之。¤The veins and veins are broken, and the gods are hard to save. Fellow Daoists have any wishes, and I will try my best to do it.
这符咒灵气甚微，怕是有修士在巷中遇害寻求帮助。我还是跟上去看看，毕竟救人一命，胜造七级浮屠。¤This spell has very little spiritual energy, and I am afraid that a cultivator will be killed in the alley for help. I still follow up and have a look. After all, it saves lives and wins the seventh-level Buddha.
想骗我？没门儿。¤Want to lie to me? No way.
一些商家见有利可乘，特意在街上支起丹药摊或灵草摊，你正想去前方的摊位看看时，一柄灵气聚成的符剑颤颤巍巍朝你飞来。¤Some merchants see that they can take advantage, and they set up a medicinal pill stand or Lingcao stand on the street. When you are about to go to the stall in front of you, a rune sword made of spiritual energy flies toward you tremblingly.
这逸风城中怎么会有{color=#d0380a}魔气{/color}出现？{vpunch=10,0.5}¤How can there be {color=#d0380a}devil spirit{/color} in this Yifeng City? {vpunch=10,0.5}
魔修突然在宁州出现，背后八成有什么阴谋。置之不理恐有大患，我一定要把他找出来！¤evil cultivator suddenly appeared in Ning Province, 80% of the conspiracy behind it. Ignore it for fear of serious trouble, I must find him out!
救...救...命......¤Help...help...life...
金......说来仙道会上与我交手的那位修士正是使用金属性功法！当时便觉得此人神色有异不似善类，难不成\r就是他？¤Jin... said that the cultivator who fought with me at the Fairy Dao Club was using metallic techniques! At that time, I felt that this person looked different or not kind, is it possible that it is him?
这暗器水平..莫非是谁家小子刚学会驱物术出来和行人闹着玩？¤This level of hidden weapon... Could it be someone who just learned how to exorcise things and come out to play with pedestrians?
你随着灵气指引逐渐深入小巷，一缕令人生恶的气息在空气中弥散。¤As you follow the guidance of the spiritual energy, you gradually go deep into the alley, and a nasty breath is diffused in the air.
话没说完，她把头一偏，明显是断气了。¤She didn't finish her words, she tilted her head, obviously dead.
你一把捞住符剑，剑身若隐若现的灵气汇聚成纤细的线，指向路旁的深巷。¤You grab the talisman sword, the looming aura of the sword body gathers into a slender line, pointing to the deep alley beside the road.
这人应该是为了供奉俸禄而来，或许如今就在{color=#d0380a}宁王府{/color}！¤This person should have come for the pay of a Guest Elder, perhaps now in {color=#d0380a}Ningwang Mansion{/color}!
你又随意逛了逛街道上支起的摊位，发现都是些稀松平常的物件，便兴致索然地离开了。¤You wandered around the stalls erected on the street again, and found that they were all ordinary objects, and then left uninterestedly.
这就是此地的伴生矿物吧。¤This is the associated mineral here.
这《奇门遁甲录》又名《阵道》，实乃阵法一道的集大成之作。若能寻得这功法，对于阵道一途必定大有裨益。¤This book, also known as the Dao of Formation, is a masterpiece in the art of formation. If you can find this technique, it will be of great benefit to the path of the Dao of Formation.
这《意守法》乃突破化神之秘术，如今掌握在宁州各大势力手中，唯有用大量灵核方可兑换。¤This Yi Guardian Technique is a secret technique for breaking through the Deity Transformation and is now in the hands of the major powers in Ning Province, and can only be exchanged with a large number of spirit cores.
万年之前宁州不乏阵道大师，若说哪里最有希望得到这些失传的阵道绝学，恐怕也只有在这宁州古迹之中了。¤There was no shortage of formation masters in Ning Province 10,000 years ago, so if there is any hope of obtaining these lost formation masterpieces, I'm afraid it's only in this Ning Province monument.
有关宁州古迹的情报么...{$TmpTalkString}可曾听说过登仙殿？¤Any information about the monuments of Ning Province... {Have you heard of the Hall of the Immortals?
有关宁州古迹的情报么...{$TmpTalkString}可曾听说过《意守法》？¤Any information about the Ning Province monuments... {$TmpTalkString}Have you ever heard of the Law of the 《Defense Mantra Technique》
不过这空间乱流虽然危险，但却有不少像{color=#d0380a}陨母{/color}这样的稀有材料无须漂浮于其中。那时若有{color=#d0380a}体道大成{/color}修为，自然便可顺路收集更多的材料。¤However, although this spatial turbulence is dangerous, there are many rare materials like {color=#d0380a}meteorite mother{/color} that need not float in it. At that time, if one has {color=#d0380a}Body Dao Da Cheng{/color} cultivation, one can naturally collect more materials along the way.
依我看，这四柄魔剑有很大的可能仍然留在宁州古迹之中，不过即便是能够找到，能否收为己用又是另一回事了。¤In my opinion, there is a high probability that these four magic swords are still in the Ning Province monuments, but even if they can be found, whether they can be collected for their own use is another matter.
唔...原来{$TmpTalkString}早就听说过了么...¤Hmm... So I've heard of {$TmpTalkString} before...
不过要说这《意守法》的出处，其实也是前人在宁州古迹中寻得的。据说这秘术就记载于古原城一处石碑之上，不过唯有{color=#d0380a}心境与神识{/color}修为极高者，方可领悟。¤The origin of the Intent to Keep Law is actually found in the monuments of Ning Province by previous people. It is said that this secret technique is recorded on a stone tablet in Gu Yuan City, but only those with extremely high {color=#d0380a} mind and soul sense {/color} cultivation can comprehend it.
当年金虹剑仙一剑破碎虚空，劈出了如今的宁州古迹，也劈开了这诛仙剑阵，四柄魔剑也因此下落不明。¤When the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal a sword shattered the void, split the present-day Ning Province monuments, but also split the Immortal Punishing Sword Formation, the four magic swords are also unaccounted for.
可惜随着正魔之战后古原城的陷落，如今这功法便只有在每千年一次古迹开启之时，才有可能见到了。¤Unfortunately, with the fall of Gu Yuan City after the Battle of the Righteous Demons, this technique can now only be seen once every thousand years when the monuments are opened.
传说万年前这古原城能够被称为宁州第一大城，便是因为在城中的登仙殿里藏着一本极为神秘的天阶功法，吸引来自各地的修士前来观摩。¤Legend has it that 10,000 years ago, this ancient original city could be called the number one city in Ning Province because of an extremely mysterious Heavenly Ranking Technique hidden in the Immortal Hall in the city, which attracted cultivators from all over the world to come and observe it.
即便修为再深，若长期被困在古迹之中，也会被这煞气侵蚀失去神智，变成不人不鬼的{color=#d0380a}活死人{/color}。¤Even if you have a deep cultivation, if you are trapped in the monuments for a long time, you will lose your mind to this fatal energy and turn into an inhuman {color=#d0380a}living dead person{/color}.
就拿那个《玄清天衍录》说吧，万年来从未听说过有人从古迹里成功领悟过这本功法。¤Take that Xuanqing Heavenly Derivation Record, in ten thousand years no one has ever heard of anyone successfully comprehending this technique from the monuments.
有关宁州古迹的情报么...{$TmpTalkString}可曾听说过空间乱流？¤Any information about the Ning Province monuments... {$TmpTalkString} ever heard of spatial turbulence?
有关宁州古迹的情报么...{$TmpTalkString}可曾听说过万年前遗失的四柄魔剑？¤Any information about the Ning Province monuments... {$TmpTalkString}Have you ever heard of the four magic swords that were lost 10,000 years ago?
有关宁州古迹的情报么...{$TmpTalkString}可曾听说过煞气？¤Any information about the Ning Province monuments... {$TmpTalkString}Have you ever heard of brakes?
有关宁州古迹的情报么...{$TmpTalkString}可曾听说过失传已久的阵道功法《奇门遁甲录》？¤Any information about the ancient monuments of Ning Province... {$TmpTalkString}Have you ever heard of the long-lost formation technique The Book of Qi Men Dun Jia?
族中古籍记载的许多阵道功法如今都已经失传了，当下宁州阵道一途式微，除我公孙一族外再无专心研究阵道的门派，大概也是因此缘由。¤Many of the formation techniques recorded in the ancient books of our clan have now been lost, and this is probably the reason why the formation path in Ning Province is now in decline, and there is no sect dedicated to the study of formation other than my Gongsun clan.
再者说，若真有什么机缘，我又凭什么告诉{$TmpTalkString}？¤Furthermore, if there is any chance, who am I to tell {$TmpTalkString}?
但若{color=#d0380a}心境{/color}不坚，即便只是短时间接触煞气，也会被它影响至头晕目眩而无法施展神通。¤But if the {color=#d0380a}mind{/color} is not strong, even if you are only exposed to the fatal energy for a short time, you will be affected by it to the extent that you will become dizzy and unable to perform your divine powers.
总之，能找到些稀有草药矿石就不错了。像那些不靠谱的传言，不听也罢！¤In short, it would be nice to find some rare herbal ores. Like those unreliable rumours, don't listen to them!
杀戮之地往往煞气凝结，这宁州古迹本就是古代战场，煞气累积万年更是只增不减。¤This Ning Province monument was originally an ancient battlefield, and the fury that has accumulated over the years has only increased.
传说魔门有四柄魔剑，分别唤作诛仙，戮仙，陷仙与绝仙，合于一处便可布下强大的诛仙剑阵，即便是化神强者亦可诛杀。¤Legend has it that the Demon Sect has four demonic swords, called the Immortal Punishing, Immortal Killing, Immortal Trapping and Immortal Exterminating, which when combined together can create a powerful Immortal Punishing Sword Formation that can kill even the strongest of Deity Transformation.
哼，古迹里真正的宝贝几千年前就被瓜分一空了，如今再去也不过是碰碰运气罢了。¤The real treasures in the monuments were divided up thousands of years ago, so going back now would be just a chance.
嗯？这宁州古迹前前后后都被搜刮不知多少次了吧，还能剩下什么机缘？¤Hmm? This Ning Province monument has been raided many times before and after, so what chance is left?
我曾听族中前辈提过，想要进入宁州古迹，必须先穿过一片空间乱流。若肉体力量未修炼至大成，便无法在这乱流中控制方向，只能随波逐流，随意寻一处缝隙进入古迹。¤I have heard my ancestors mention that in order to enter the Ning Province monuments, one must first cross a spatial turbulence. If you haven't cultivated your physical strength to a high level, you won't be able to control your direction in this turbulence, so you can only follow the waves and find a gap at random to enter the monument.
此人相貌风流，却不知为何眉间戾气不散，给人一种凶恶之感。你摇了摇头，决定不再多想，眼下还是比赛更为重要。¤This person has a romantic appearance, but somehow the hostility between his eyebrows does not dissipate, giving a sense of fierceness. You shook your head and decided not to think too much. The game is more important now.
这斗法台的比试随时都开放着，道友若是对自己有信心，上台比试便是。¤The competition in this fighting platform is open at any time. If a Taoist friend has confidence in himself, then the competition is on stage.
宁王府是宁王同家眷及供奉住所，就位于逸风城东北部。¤The Palace of Ning King is the residence of Ning King's family and Guest Elders, and it is located in the northeast of Yifeng City.
天下仙道会乃宁王为选拔供奉所举办，所有表现出色的修士均可成为宁王府座上宾。¤The World Immortal Dao Association is held by Ning King for the selection of Guest Elders. All cultivators with outstanding performance can become guests of Ning King's Mansion.
哈哈哈，金道友果然实力不凡，不过我看这位{FirstName}道友信心满满，想来也有不俗的法力。你们二位谁能在这场比试中胜出，我便将他引荐与宁王。¤Hahaha, Fellow Daoist Jin is indeed extraordinary, but I think this Daoist {FirstName} is full of confidence and has good mana if he wants to come. If you two can win in this competition, I will introduce him to Ning King. .
天下仙道会只有{color=#d0380a}筑基期{/color}以上境界的修士可参与，道友还是待日后修为精进再前来报名吧。¤Only cultivators of the realm above {color=#d0380a}foundation period{/color} can participate in the World Fairy Dao Society. Daoists should wait for their cultivation level to advance before coming to sign up.
嘿，一旦进了宁王府，那便有了享不尽的荣华富贵，多少人挤破头皮也想得到宁王的赏识，这岂不就是最大的赏赐。¤Hey, once you enter Prince Ning's Mansion, you will have endless glory and wealth. How many people want to get the appreciation of Ning King even if they squeeze their scalp, isn't this the greatest reward.
你正与擂台管事了解相关事宜，就听得台下传来一阵高呼声。原是台上之人已打退几波攻擂修士，管事见此也面露赞色。¤You are learning about the related matters with the ring manager, and you heard a loud voice from the audience. It was originally the people on the stage who had repelled several waves of attacking cultivators, and the manager also showed compliments when he saw this.
你暗中打量对手，他单手执一柄金属扇子法器，隐隐透出锋锐之气，想来应主修金属性功法。¤You look at your opponent secretly, and he holds a metal fan magic weapon with one hand, faintly revealing a sharp aura, and he should major in metallic exercises if he wants to.
此情此景使你不觉技痒，示意擂台管事后便运起功法跃上擂台。¤This situation and situation makes you not feel the itch. You signal to the ringmaster to take the exercises and jump into the ring afterwards.
逸风府为宁王处理政务之地，平日里不对外开放。¤Yifeng Mansion is the place where Ning King handles government affairs. It is not open to the outside world on weekdays.
道友可是前来参加天下仙道会的？{w}{w=0.5}¤Friends of Taoism came to participate in the World Fairy Dao Association? {w}{w=0.5}
此地看来是一处天然形成的洞窟，你决定...？{w}{w=0.5}¤This place seems to be a naturally formed cave. You decide...? {w}{w=0.5}
你收敛气息，慢慢走进洞窟深处，索性并没有遇到其他的危险，¤You restrained your breath and slowly walked into the depths of the cave, simply not encountering other dangers,
你将草药其纳入储物袋，然后心满意足地离开了。¤You put the herbal medicine in your storage bag, and then left contentedly.
此等品阶的草药实乃可遇而不可求之物，索性还没有人在你之前发现此处机缘。你决定...？{w}{w=0.5}¤Herbs of this level are things that can be encountered but cannot be sought. No one has discovered the opportunity before you. You decide...?{w}{w=0.5}
你小心翼翼地摘下草药，将其纳入储物袋，然后心满意足地离开了。¤You carefully picked the herbs, put them in your storage bag, and left contentedly.
你谨慎地用神识扫过洞窟，随即惊喜地发现了两株极为罕见的{SayStcVal=948}¤You carefully scanned the cave with your spiritual sense, and then you were pleasantly surprised to find two extremely rare {SayStcVal=948}
此等品阶的草药实乃可遇而不可求之物，但机遇往往也可能伴随着巨大的风险。你决定...？{w}{w=0.5}¤Herbs of this level are things that can be encountered but not sought, but opportunities may also be accompanied by huge risks. You decide...? {w}{w=0.5}
我素来好战，热衷冒险历练。但在这无尽之海上，却第一次感到了迷惘。¤I have always been warlike and keen on adventures. But for the first time in this endless sea, I felt lost.
百里奇思忖片刻，随即朗声大笑。¤Baliqi thought for a moment, then laughed loudly.
百里家族训云：“入海者，蓬莎止。”¤The Baili family replied: Pongsha is the only one who enters the sea.
百里奇沉默地看向远方的海洋，过了好一会儿才收回目光。¤Balic looked at the distant ocean in silence, and it took a while before he looked back.
百里一族在无尽之海中最远只可到蓬莎岛，我曾问过祖父原因，他只说若是前往更深的海域便会惹上杀身之祸。¤The Baili clan can only reach Pongsha Island the farthest in the endless sea. I once asked my grandfather the reason. He only said that if he went to deeper waters, he would get killed.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}若有想要交易的物品也可到坊市看看。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} If you have items you want to trade, you can also go to Fangshi.
这还用说，自然是以体破万法，以力敌千钧。若地拦我，我便碎这地：若天阻我，我便破这天！¤It goes without saying that it is natural to break through the world with the body, and to force the enemy. If the ground stops me, I will break the ground: if the sky hinders me, I will break the day!
那这海又算作何物？¤Then what does this sea count as?
哈哈哈，多谢{FirstName}{xiongdi}，真是当局者迷旁观者清。¤Hahaha, thank you {FirstName}{xiongdi}, the authorities are really fans of the bystanders.
你还有机会前往无尽之海的深处历练，但我却做不到。¤You still have the opportunity to go to the depths of the endless sea, but I can't do it.
蓬莎岛经济发达，许多世家都会来到蓬莎岛寻求贸易机会，百里家也不例外。¤Pongsha Island is economically developed, many families will come to Pongsha Island to seek trade opportunities, Bailijia is no exception.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}所言甚是，我还是先回去看看商队吧。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} said that, I'd better go back and see the caravan first.
百里兄有此兴致，我定当奉陪，不知百里兄打算何时出海？¤Brother Baili is interested in this, I will accompany him. I don't know when Brother Baili plans to go to sea?
百里兄的道为何？¤What is the way of Brother Baili?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，别来无恙？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, don't come here without problems?
幼时叔父的船队不听劝告，为了货物冒险前往碎星岛，最后整支船队都在海上失去了音讯。¤When I was young, my uncle's fleet did not listen to advice, and ventured to Broken Star Island for cargo. In the end, the entire fleet was lost at sea.
我在这蓬莎岛还有些事情要处理，恕难奉陪。¤I still have some things to deal with on Pongsha Island, and I can't help it.
我打算择日出海，不知{FirstName}{xiongdi}是否有兴趣同行？¤I plan to choose the sea, I wonder if {FirstName}{xiongdi} is interested in traveling together?
自我突破金丹以来经常随家族商队携货物来到蓬莎岛，与这无尽之海上的修士交换些陆上没有的修炼资源。¤Since I broke through the Golden Core, I have often accompanied the family caravan to Pongsha Island and exchanged some training resources that are not available on land with the cultivators in this endless sea.
前车之鉴在此，恐怕百里家的祖训确有其事。百里兄还是谨遵祖训，切莫以身试险了。¤This is the lesson from the past, I am afraid that the ancestral training of Baili's family is true. Brother Baili still follows the ancestral training, and don't try to risk it.
无尽之海当真莫测，不知此行能有什么收获。¤The endless sea is really unpredictable, I don't know what to gain from this trip.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}可曾前往过更深的海域？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} has ever been to deeper waters?
无妨，我最近都会待在岛上。等你把手头的事情处理完，再回码头找我便是。¤It's okay, I'll stay on the island lately. When you're done with your business, you can go back to the pier to find me.
现下家族商队并无紧要之事，{FirstName}{xiongdi}若是愿意，我们即刻便可出发！¤There is nothing important for the family caravan at the moment. If {FirstName}{xiongdi} is willing, we can set off immediately!
何人入阵？！纳命来！¤Who is in the battle?! Take your life!
没想到{FirstName}{gongzi}几乎独自破解了这个阵眼。在下还想着接应，现在想来没添乱已经是万幸了。¤Unexpectedly, {FirstName}{gongzi} almost cracked this formation on his own. I was still thinking about responding, and now I think it’s a blessing that I haven’t added any chaos.
{FirstName}{gongzi}小心！！¤{FirstName}{gongzi} be careful!!
公孙季向你拱拱手，没有再说什么。¤Gongsunji bowed to you and said nothing.
随着傀儡的倒下，周遭平静了下来，灵气也归于平静。若不是破碎的傀儡静静地躺在地上，完全看不出这里发生过一场大战。¤As the puppet fell, the surroundings calmed down, and the aura returned to peace. If it weren't for the broken puppet lying quietly on the ground, there would be no telling that a big battle had taken place here.
你被火焰傀儡击倒，眼看着一双被火焰包裹着的巨拳就要令你身陨道消。¤You are knocked down by the flame puppet, and seeing a pair of giant fists wrapped in flames will kill you.
公孙兄客气了，若不是有你的阵法作为后援，我也难以安心破解此阵。¤Brother Gongsun is polite, if it weren't for your formation as a back-up, I wouldn't be able to crack this formation with peace of mind.
只见公孙季匆匆赶来。他手捏法袂，瞬息之间已布下多个阵法为你挡下这一拳。然后转身与傀儡缠斗到了一起。¤I saw Gongsun Ji hurried over. He squeezed his sleeves, and in an instant he had deployed multiple formations to block the punch for you. Then he turned around and fought with the puppet.
姗姗来迟的公孙季看了看破碎的傀儡，一丝惊讶在他眼中转瞬而逝，显然是没想到你这么快就解决了傀儡。¤The belated Gongsunji looked at the broken puppet, and a trace of surprise passed in his eyes. Obviously, he did not expect you to solve the puppet so quickly.
但灵核矿脉则不同，灵核只会在密度极大的情况下经过长时间的压缩而形成。而灵脉中密度越大的地方，想要找到并采集到灵核的难度也越大。¤But spirit core veins are different, spirit cores will only be formed after a long period of compression with great density. And the greater the density in the spiritual veins, the more difficult it is to find and collect the spiritual cores.
一般的灵石矿脉，任何人都能采集，无非是速度快慢而已。¤General spirit stone veins can be collected by anyone, it's just a matter of speed.
道友在进入灵脉前，我会给道友发放一枚记时玉简，用于记录道友在灵脉中采集的时间。¤Before you enter the spirit vein, I will give you a timekeeping jade slip to record the time you spend collecting in the spirit vein.
每在灵脉中采集一个月，道友需向我们缴纳一枚灵核或是与之等价的灵石。相对应的，我们也会维持整个灵脉内的秩序。¤For every month of collecting in the spirit veins, you need to pay us a spirit core or a spirit stone of equal value. We will also maintain the order within the entire spirit vein.
青石灵脉由宁州各派轮流管理，对所有修真者开放。¤The Qing Shi Spiritual Vein is managed by each sect in Ning Province on a rotating basis and is open to all cultivators.
请道友指点。¤Please Daoist friend point out.
灵脉内原则上不禁止争斗比试抢夺灵气充裕的采集点，但切记不要下死手。否则一旦出了人命，执法队也不会放任不管。¤Spiritual veins within the principle does not prohibit the fight competition to grab the collection point of abundant spiritual energy, but remember not to play deadly hands. Otherwise, once a life is lost, the law enforcement team will not let it go unchecked.
道友还有什么想问的么？¤Is there anything else you would like to ask?
若是道友神识修为不足的话，建议不要太过深入灵脉，在外围采集便可。¤If you do not have enough soul sense cultivation, it is recommended not to go too deep into the spirit veins, just collect at the periphery.
各大门派包括白帝楼都有负责灵核兑换的执事，道友收集到足够的灵核后，可以和他们兑换许多修炼与突破用的必须品。¤All major sects, including the White Emperor Pavillion, have deacons who are responsible for the exchange of spirit cores. After you have collected enough spirit cores, you can exchange them for many essential items for cultivation and breakthroughs.
道友看着面生，应该是第一次来青石灵脉吧。需要我为道友介绍一二么？¤You look new to me, so this should be your first time at the Greenstone Spiritual Vein. The first time you've ever been to the Greenstone Spiritual Vein, you've been to the Greenstone Spiritual Vein.
还有什么问题么？¤Are there any more questions?
若是没有足够的神识修为，不但采集速度会大幅降低，就连找到灵核的位置也极其困难。¤If you don't have enough soul sense cultivation, not only the collection speed will be significantly reduced, even to find the location of the spiritual core is extremely difficult.
灵核虽不像灵石那样便于使用，但却是各大宗门与势力布置大型阵法时的必备之物。¤Although the spirit core is not as easy to use as the spirit stone, but it is a necessary thing for the major sects and forces when setting up large formations.
在宁州，灵核非常稀有，唯有我们青石灵脉可以比较稳定的找到这种资源。¤In Ning Province, spirit cores are very rare, and the only place where we can find this resource more consistently is in the Greenstone Spirit Vein.
阁下能如此说，在下便了然了。¤If your Excellency can say so, I will be able to understand.
想必阁下踏过化神的门槛，只是迟或早而已，范某便提前恭贺阁下了。¤I think you have stepped over the threshold of Deity Transformation, just late or early, so Fan congratulated you in advance.
谢阁主关心，那在下便先行告退了。¤Thank you for your concern, then I will leave first.
呵呵呵呵，阁下可还算有收获？¤The actual fact is that you can get a lot more out of it.
想必阁主也是早已感悟过此物，知晓其中玄妙，才会特意在此等候吧。¤I think the owner of the pavilion has long felt this thing, know the mystery of it, so it will wait here on purpose.
范阁主说笑了，我若全无收获，怎舍得这么快便出来？¤Fan Court Master is joking, if I have nothing to gain, how can I come out so quickly?
也好，在下便送你一程罢。¤I'll give you a ride.
阁主过誉了，若有此事，在下必然不会坐视不理。¤I'm sure I won't sit idly by if this happens.
事毕，你径直走到入口处，范阁主仍在此处等候。¤After the matter, you walk straight to the entrance, Fan Court Master is still waiting here.
日后我阁若不慎落入危难之间，还望阁下能伸以援手。¤In the future, if my pavilion inadvertently falls into a crisis, I hope that you can lend a helping hand.
你察觉到他嘴角隐约露出了一丝会心的笑，但立刻就消失不见。¤You perceive a vague hint of a knowing smile at the corner of his mouth, but it immediately disappears.
哈哈哈哈哈，那范某便提前谢过阁下了。¤Hahahahahahahaha, then I, Fan, will thank you in advance.
阁下刚有所顿悟，还是早点加以巩固为上。¤You have just had an epiphany, it is better to consolidate it early.
你二人行至主阁前，相互作了一揖后，他便目送你御剑离开了。¤The two of you marched to the front of the main pavilion, and after making a bow to each other, he watched you leave with the sword.
呼...好险。¤Hoo... it's very risky.
哼，不过如此。¤Huh, but that's it.
哼，这些沂山的小鬼竟敢把主意打到老子身上来，还真是不把我们老倪家放在眼里了。¤Hmph, these Mt. Yi brats dare to go after me, they really don't respect our Ni family at all.
那太好了，我也正想去瞧瞧呢。¤That's great, I'm just about to check it out.
没想到{xiongdi}你如此功力便奋不顾身来助我...那我也不能藏着掖着了！¤To think that {xiongdi} would come to my rescue when you are still very inexperienced... Very well then, I shouldn't be hiding anything from you.
哎，不说他们了，{FirstName}{xiongdi}此时来这里，也是准备去参加{color=#d0380a}东石谷{/color}的仙师集会吧？¤Hey, let's not talk about them, {FirstName}{xiongdi} is here at this time, and is also going to participate in the rally of {color=#d0380a}East Stone Valley{/color} immortal masters?
如此甚好，那就有劳倪兄引路了！¤That's great, then I'll be grateful to Brother Ni for guiding the way!
不过但凡这种{color=#d0380a}坊市{/color}集会，肯定能打听到不少修真界的消息，我们也跟去看看便是。¤However, as long as this kind of {color=#d0380a}fangshi{/color} rally, we can definitely hear a lot of news from the realm of cultivation, so let's go and see it.
（老头，你有听说过这个什么仙师集会么？）¤(Old man, have you ever heard of this gathering of immortal masters?)
嗐，我也没想明白。¤Sigh, I also want to know how I managed to provoke em.
老夫都在那破剑里睡了这么多年了，哪里知道这些。¤I have been sleeping in a broken sword for so many years, how would I know any of this.
刚才多谢{xiongdi}你出手相助了，在下是武陵城倪家的倪旭欣，{xiongdi}你怎么称呼？¤Many thanks, for coming to my aid just now {xiongdi}. I am Ni XuXin from the Ni family in Wuling City. May I have the privilege of knowing your name {xiongdi}?
实不相瞒，在下三个月前才刚刚踏入炼气初期。¤To be honest, I just reached the early stage of Qi refining three months ago.
{xiongdi}你刚刚大战一场，应该也受了些小伤。这几颗疗伤用的丹药你且拿着，内服后运气打坐片刻，应该就能痊愈了。¤{xiongdi} You just had a battle, and you should have suffered some minor injuries. Take these healing pills and take them. If you take it orally, you should be able to heal if you sit for a while.
那...那就多谢倪兄了！¤Then...then thank you brother Ni!
按{color=#d0380a}Tab{/color}键打开背包，可以查看刚刚获得的物品与传闻信息。\n点击{color=#d0380a}神通{/color}分页，以配置你的技能栏。\n点击{color=#d0380a}物品{/color}分页，以配置装备、使用物品。¤Press {color=#d0380a}Tab{/color} to open your backpack to view information on the items and rumours you have just acquired. \nClick on the {color=#d0380a}Skill{/color} sub-page to configure your skill bar. \nClick on the {color=#d0380a}Items{/color} sub-page to configure your equipment, use items.
咱们可是过命的交情，不用客气哈哈！¤There is no need for thank you, ours is a friendship forged in the fires of adversity, may it last a lifetime, Haha!
（魏老，你有听说过这个什么仙师集会么？）¤(Master Wei, have you ever heard of this Gathering of Cultivators?)
不知阁下是怎么招惹上这帮煞神了？¤I wonder how did you manage to provoke this gang of hoodlums?
不过但凡这种坊市集会，肯定能打听到不少修真界的消息，我们也跟去看看便是。¤However, as far as these kind of fairs are concerned, we can definitely hear a lot of news about the cultivation world, so let's go and have a look.
东石谷？¤East Stone Valley?
在下姓{FirstName}，恰好路过这里，刚刚那些人是...？¤My last name is {FirstName}, and I happened to pass by here. Who were those people just now...?
这些人是{color=#d0380a}沂山派{/color}的修士，专门干一些杀人夺宝的缺德事儿，瞧见我淘了件不错的法器，就想来夺。¤These people are cultivators of the {color=#d0380a}Yishan Sect{/color}, who specialize in some wicked things that kill people and steal treasures. Seeing that I found a good artifact, I wanted to grab it.
呼...好险。没想到这几个沂山派的小鬼还有两下子。¤Huh... it's a risk. I didn't expect that these little Yishan sects will have two tricks.
正遇到他们在谷外大张旗鼓兜售一件号称地阶的“赤乙扇”。¤I met them outside the valley, trying to peddle a so-called Earth Grade 'Crimson Fan'.
我一眼就看出这是假货，但他们却打死不认。于是我便用我手上这把真的赤乙扇，一击把那赝品打碎了。¤I could see with a quick glance that it was fake, but they refused to admit they were wrong. Thus I used the real Crimson Fan I have and shattered the counterfeit with a single blow.
这东石谷每年的{color=#d0380a}一月和二月{/color}都会举办仙师集会，宁州的许多青年修士都会来这里摆摊交易，也算一大盛事。¤Every {color=#d0380a} January and February{/color} East Stone Valley will hold a gathering of immortals. Many young cultivators in Ning Province will come here to set up stalls and trade, for this major event.
我本来是准备去参加东石谷的仙师集会，淘点宝贝。¤I originally planned to go to the gathering of cultivators in East Stone Valley and get myself some goodies.
（难怪这帮沂山派的要死要活，就算是高仿赝品也得值几百灵石吧）¤(No wonder this group of Mt. Yi sect were trying to kill him, a good counterfeit must be worth at least several hundred spirit stones)
怎么样？{FirstName}{xiongdi}若是无事，不妨与我结伴一同去那东石谷转转，也许能换得一两件趁手的法宝呢。¤How about it? {FirstName}{xiongdi} If nothing happens, you might as well go to the East Stone Valley with me, maybe you can get a magic weapon or two.
那是当然! 倪家代代有训，为人要刚正不阿，鉴物要去伪存真。¤Of course! The Ni family has been instructed from generation to generation, to be honest and upright, and to discern the false and keep the truth.
这种低阶修士的集会大陆上没有上百个也有几十个的，老夫哪能都听说过。¤There are not hundreds or dozens of such gatherings of low-level cultivators on the mainland, and the old man has never heard of it.
……打碎了？¤...it shattered?
东石谷？仙师集会？¤East Stone Valley? Gathering of Cultivators?
对了，刚才看你应付那家伙有些吃力，{xiongdi}莫不是刚入炼气期？¤By the way, I just saw that you were struggling to deal with that guy. Could it be that {xiongdi} just entered the Qi refining stage?
噢？你不知道么？¤Oh? Don't you know?
这个，在下姓{FirstName}...，阁下不必客气，路见不平出手相助，这也是我辈修仙者的本分。¤This, I go by the surname {FirstName}..., Don't worry, it's my duty as a cultivator to help out when I see injustice..
这几颗生骨丹可是我好不容易从家里带出来的，疗效比那些普通的化瘀丹可好上不少。¤These few Minor Healing Pills were difficult to sneak out from home, but the curative effect is much better than those of ordinary Noivce Healing Pills.
还好他们没追上来...¤Fortunately, they didn't catch up...
此去西北百余里便是东石谷，每年的一月和二月都会举办仙师集会，宁州的许多青年修士都会来这里摆摊交易，也算一大盛事。¤To the northwest about a hundred miles or so is East Stone Valley. Every January and February, there will be a Gathering of Cultivators. Many young cultivators from Ning Province will come here to set up stalls and trade, it's quite an occasion.
这个...在下是武陵城倪家的倪旭欣，{xiongdi}你怎么称呼？¤This...I am Ni XuXin from the Ni family in Wuling City, {xiongdi} what is your name?
要是{xiongdi}赏光，不如我们一道前往东石谷？那仙师集会可是远近闻名的盛会了。¤If {xiongdi} doesn't mind the company, why don't we go to East Stone Valley together? The gathering of cultivators there is a well-known event around this region.
具体是什么也没人见到，遗留的毛发似乎和狼很像，但是寻常野狼哪敢主动招惹修仙者？事出反常，必有妖孽。¤No one has accurately seen what it looks like. The hair left behind seems to resemble a wolf, but would an ordinary wolf dare provoke a cultivator? When something goes wrong, there must be evil afoot.
一般各大城主府或是门派都会发布除妖令，根据危险程度会有不同报酬。不过妖怪可不都是无脑蛮力，危险程度也很难一概而论，功力低微者还是少参合为妙。¤Generally, the major city lord's mansions or sects will issue orders to eliminate demons, and there will be different rewards according to the degree of danger. However, not all monsters are brainless brutes, and the extent of the danger is difficult to accurately measure. It is better for those with low skill to participate less.
这也是蹊跷。野兽伤人一般贪图血肉，但是这些遇难者却无一例外被吸干了丹田真气。莫非这畜生也懂得修炼？¤That's the weird thing. Beasts generally just go after flesh and blood, but all of these victims have had their Dantian's Qi sucked dry without exception. Could it be that this beast also knows how to cultivate?
听说最近常有炼气期修士遭到未知野兽袭击，伤口全在丹田，似乎是奔着炼化的真气而来。难道这些畜生也有了灵智不成？¤I hear that recently there is often talk of unknown beasts attacking Qi refining cultivators. The wounds inflected are all located around the Dantian area. It seems that they are directly going after a cultivator's qi. Could these beasts have developed intelligence?
陷入寂静的锁鸾堂被孤独的留在身后，四近甚至没有一丝风声。¤The hall behind you, which had fallen silence was left behind, with not even a trace of wind left.
几次攻防之后，你用神通给予偷袭者致命一击，这才发现星铃儿在你与此人缠斗期间已是去过隔壁房间，如今刚好回来。¤After a few attacks, you quickly used your power to send out a fatal blow, only to notice that as you were fighting, Daoist Star was in another room and only came back now.
星铃儿边说着，边向外走去，你下意识的便用神识探向星铃儿走出来的方向，却未发现任何异常，倒是她的语气平淡得让你有些发冷。¤While talking, you used your soul sense to probe the area she just walked out of. While you found nothing amiss, her tone was so flat that you got chills.
不过瞬息之间，你与栖云真人已交手数回合，对方虽说是金丹期修士，但在你的猛烈攻势下竟是节节败退。原本在栖云真人刚动手就准备制止他的通羽、苗矮二人也是惊于你的强大实力，手下慢了几分。¤But in an instant, you and Quyun real has exchanged several rounds, the other party, although the jindan stage Vagrant Cultivator, but in your fierce attack is actually defeated. Originally in the Quyun real just move to stop him, Tong Yu, Miao short two people are also surprised by your powerful strength, under the hands of a few minutes slower.
星姑娘，隔壁是？¤Daoist Star, what was in the other room?
没什么，只是他们搜来的鼎炉而已，已经被我处理了。¤It's nothing, it was just the cauldron they were searching for. It's already been dealt with by me.
经过短暂思考后，你还是选择跟上星铃儿，放下了去隔壁房间一探究竟的念头。¤After a brief pause, you gave up on the idea of checking out the room yourself and rushed to catch up with Daoist Star.
长老堂有本奇怪的书和一封信件，我还没拆开看里面的内容。¤The Presbyterian Church has a strange book and a letter. I haven't opened it to read the contents.
啊，是中草堂寄来的！凡人没办法使用玉简，要通过书信交流...中草堂无法确定仙长需要的“天蝉灵叶”生长于何处，望您海涵。¤Ah, it's from the Central Herb Pavilion! Mortals can't use jade slips, they have to communicate through letters... Central Herb Pavilion can't determine where the Skyscada Leaf that the Veneral Celestial needs grows, please forgive us.
虽然私拆信件不太好，但特殊时期这也是没办法的事。让我看看里面写了什么......¤Although it is not very good to open the letter privately, it is also impossible in special times. Let me see what is written in it...
我从来没听说过这种草药，长老堂要它做什么？¤I have never heard of this herb. What does the Presbyterian Church want it for?
至于这本书...我一时也找不到头绪。为什么要挖得坑坑洼洼呢？¤As for this book...I can't find the clue for a while. Why is it so pitted?
眼前的路径遍布生生不息的藤蔓，稍有不慎便会深陷其中。¤The path in front of you is full of endless vines. If you are not careful, you will get stuck in it.
此地由数块奇石组成，似乎是一座天然的困阵。¤This place is composed of several strange stones, which seems to be a natural formation.
你翻了翻储物袋，发现你并没有{$Var1}。¤You look through the storage bag and find that you don't have {$Var1}.
遁速不足的你，在其中相形见绌只得退回来。¤You, who are not fast enough, are dwarfed by it and have to retreat.
眼前的路径烈火熊熊，温度及其骇人。¤The path in front of you is blazing, and the temperature is terrifying.
你凭借遁速强闯而过。¤You drove through with your speed.
你在阵中兜兜转转有回到了原地。¤You went back and forth in the formation and returned to your place.
此地有一滩毒沼，瘴气弥漫在空中。¤There is a poisonous swamp here, and the miasma is in the air.
眼前的路径遍布锋利的金石，罡风四射。¤The path in front of you is covered with sharp stones, and the wind is everywhere.
你通过对{$wudaoname2}的领悟，通过了此地异象。¤You passed the vision of this place through your comprehension of {$wudaoname2}.
眼前的路径寒气四溢，寒风四起。¤The path in front of you is full of cold, and the cold wind is everywhere.
你通过对{$wudaoname1}的领悟，通过了此地异象。¤You passed the vision of this place through the understanding of {$wudaoname1}.
眼前山石散去化沙，一滩巨大的流沙横亘于前。¤The rocks in front of me are scattered and turned into sand, and a huge pool of quicksand lies in front of me.
对{$wudaoname1}的领悟，难以通过此地异象。¤The comprehension of {$wudaoname1} is difficult to pass the vision here.
你决定.......¤You decide.......
御起{$Var1}，通过此地异象。¤Yuqi{$Var1}, through the vision of this place.
对{$wudaoname2}的领悟，难以通过此地异象。¤The comprehension of {$wudaoname2} is difficult to pass the vision here.
没想到这老道竟已是金丹修为，若非身中蛊毒，我又岂是他的对手。¤Unexpectedly, this old way is actually a golden core cultivation base, if it is not for the poison in my body, then I am his opponent.
这老头，看来是邪道中人我还是回白帝楼汇报一下吧 。¤This old man, it seems that he is a member of the evil way, I should report back to Baidilou.
你说这白帝和血薇过去到底发生过什么呢？¤What do you think has happened in the past between this White Emperor and Blood Violet?
{$TmpTalkString}今天可真是让我刮目相看呢。¤{$TmpTalkString} is really impressing me today.
呼...多...多谢道友出手相助，否则我一时不备，恐怕已糟了此人毒手。¤Hoo... More... Thank you for your help, otherwise I was not prepared, I'm afraid I've already been poisoned by this person.
还请道友收下我的传音符印记，日后若有事尽管吩咐，我一定尽力而为！¤Also please accept my voice transmission talisman seal, if there is something in the future, just tell me, I will do my best!
既然能为阁下做的事情都做了，便只能祝阁下一切顺利了。¤Since all that can be done for you has been done, I can only wish you all the best.

不一会，她平复了心情，随即拿出了一个储物袋。¤Not a moment later, she calmed down, and then took out a storage bag.
不错。只不过我要做的事，却简单得多。¤That's right. But what I have to do is much simpler.
就算希望再渺茫，我也想复活她。¤Even if the hope is slim, I also want to resurrect her.
你们的招式与本座之前所修的功法似乎出自同源，本座也颇感兴趣，你且看好？¤Your stances seem to come from the same source as the kung fu I have trained before, and I am interested in them.

前辈还有何事？¤What else can I do for you?
实不相瞒，贵殿的招式与我之前所修的功法似乎出自同源，我也颇感兴趣，不知道友可愿赐教？¤I'm not going to lie, the moves of your hall seem to come from the same source as the technique I was practicing before, and I'm quite interested, so I wonder if you would like to teach me?
若我所猜不错，道友也是想复活剑中的魂体吧？¤If my guess is right, you are also trying to revive the soul in the sword, right?
道友可是拿到逆天造化术了？¤Daoist friend but got the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique?

原来如此...这功法虽说很是初级，但确与我派功法出自同源，也不知是什么时候流传出去的。¤I see... This technique is very elementary, but it really comes from the same source as my school's technique, and I don't know when it was passed on.

嗯，不知你今后可有何打算？¤Well, I wonder what your plans are for the future?
前辈替我殿找到镇殿之宝，这些东西还请前辈收下。¤Senior has found the treasure of the temple for my temple, so please accept these things.
前辈看好，此乃我万魂殿入门功法《幽魂录》...¤Watch out, this is the Ghostly Soul Record, the initiation technique of the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls...

没想到其条件竟如此苛刻…¤I didn't expect its conditions to be so harsh...
你且看好，此乃我万魂殿入门功法《幽魂录》...¤This is my introductory technique for the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls, 'Ghost Record'...
前辈此等功绩，若感兴趣的话，在下愿将本殿功法演示一遍，以供前辈参考。¤If you are interested in these feats, I would like to demonstrate the techniques of this hall for your reference.
道友替我殿找到镇殿之宝，这些东西还请道友收下。¤You have found the lost treasure of our temple, please accept these meager trinkets。
阁下此等功绩，也的确够资格做我殿名誉长老。你若感兴趣的话，我亲自教你便是。你已有一定基础，想必花费不了多少时日，便可入门了。¤Your such merits are indeed qualified to be an honorary elder of my temple. If you are interested, I will teach you personally. You already have a certain foundation, I think it will not take much time to get started.
接过储物袋后，你迅速用神识扫过一便——其中天材地宝一应俱全。¤After receiving the pouch, you quickly sweep through it with your soul sense - it is full of heavenly treasures.
既然能为你做的事情本座都做了，便只能祝你一切顺利了。¤Since I have done all that I can do for you, I can only wish you all the best.

又过了几个月，百里奇依旧没有出现。再不启航就要错过与龙湛的约定了，还是去他的房间看看吧。¤A few months later, Bailiqi still did not appear. If you don't set sail, you will miss the appointment with Long Zhan. Let's go to his room and have a look.
击败无尽之海中的妖兽后，道友一定记得将它们身上可用的部位收集起来，像是皮、爪、牙之类的..¤After defeating the monster beasts in the endless sea, fellow Taoists must remember to collect the available parts of their bodies, such as skins, claws, and teeth...
远方的雾气渐浓，慢慢凝聚成一个巨大地气团。这原本在吞云海上是十分常见的景象，但与此同时...¤The fog in the distance gradually thickened and slowly condensed into a huge air mass. This was originally a very common sight in the sea of ​​swallowing clouds, but at the same time...
元婴期之前的海兽大都没有灵智，应该不会是想观摩突破的过程，至于分一点灵气，也不至于到如此规模……且再看看吧。¤Most of the sea beasts before the Nascent Soul stage did not have spiritual wisdom, so it should not be because they wanted to observe the breakthrough process. As for sharing a little spiritual energy, it would not be on such a scale... Let's take a look.
附近地天地灵气都在向那个方向汇集，依我看，像是有什么人或是海兽正在突破。¤The auras of the earth and the earth are gathering in that direction. From what I see, it seems that someone or a sea beast is breaking through.
不错，如此情形老夫也是第一次见到，也算是开了眼界罢。¤Yes, this is the first time this old man has seen such a situation, and it can be regarded as an eye-opener.
那这些海兽围过去是什么目的？难道想分一点突破的灵气不成？¤Then what was the purpose of these sea beasts surrounding the past? Don't you want to share the aura of a breakthrough?
几个时辰之后，一声震天长啸从云雾中传来，一只吞云蟒破云而出，四周瞬间烟消云散。¤A few hours later, a thunderous roar came from the clouds, a cloud swallowing python burst out of the cloud, and the surrounding area instantly disappeared.
好多海兽...恐怕有数百只！这天地异象看来非同寻常，竟能吸引这么多海兽汇聚于此？¤A lot of sea beasts... I'm afraid there are hundreds of them! This vision of heaven and earth seems to be extraordinary, and it can attract so many sea beasts to gather here?
只见一条乳白色的遗蜕从半空中掉落下来，众海兽一拥而上，片刻便将那遗蜕分食殆尽了。¤I saw a milky white slaughter fall from the air, and the sea beasts swarmed up and devoured the slaughter in a moment.
只见约莫几百只筑基、金丹期海兽蹲守在云雾周围，仿佛在等待着什么。¤I saw about a few hundred foundation-building and Jindan stage sea beasts squatting around the clouds, as if waiting for something.
原来是为了吞云蟒的遗蜕……想必对于低阶海兽来说，这遗蜕也算大补之物吧。¤It turned out to be for the slough of the cloud swallowing python... Presumably for low-level sea beasts, this slaughter can be considered a great supplement.

道不同，不相为谋。我看你还是去找你的那些“正道”朋友们吧。¤Different paths, not for each other. I think you'd better go to your 'righteous' friends.
自古正邪不两立，我恐怕不能答应你...¤Since ancient times, good and evil are not mutually exclusive, I'm afraid I can not promise you ...
道友的红颜知己如此之多，恐怕也不差我这一个了吧？¤Daoist has so many confidantes, I'm afraid I'm not the only one missing, right?

我们之间的境界差距甚大，即便真的结为道侣，只怕日后也只会徒增烦恼罢了...¤The difference between our realms is very large, even if we do form a couple, I'm afraid that in the future will only add to the trouble...
道友连洞府都尚未开辟，现在讨论这些恐怕还太早了些吧...¤You have not even opened your cave yet, it's still too early to discuss this...
哈哈哈，{shidi}既然已经筑基，门派藏经阁内的地阶功法也可以随意借阅，哪里还需要学那些外门的粗浅招式。¤Hahahaha, {shidi}Since I've already built my foundation, I can borrow as many of the earth-ranked techniques in the sect's scripture collection as I like, so where's the need to learn those crude moves of the outer sects?
另外，每年的七月份，我都会在宗门广场进行讲法，帮助外门弟子解答一些修炼上的问题。你如果在修炼中遇到了瓶颈，到时可以来这里听讲。¤In addition, in July every year, I will teach the Fa at Zongmen Square to help outer disciples answer some questions about cultivation. If you encounter a bottleneck in your cultivation, you can come here to listen.
你要勤勉修习，不得懈怠。¤You have to practice diligently and don't slack off.
{shidi}，今日怎么想起来找我了？¤{shidi}, what made you want to see me today?
我派目前还有授业的有三位长老，分别是火云，苍坤\r和正阳三位前辈，你想了解哪一位？¤There are currently three elders in my school, namely Flamecloud, Pale Earth and Bright Sun. Which one do you want to know about?
本派外门弟子的法术皆由我来传授，如果你的{color=#d0380a}修为进境{/color}有所提升，就能来我这里学习新的法术。¤The spells of the outer disciples of this school are all taught by me. If your {color=#d0380a}cultivation base{/color} improves, you can come to me to learn new spells.
还有别的事么？¤Is there anything else?
是我输了。¤I lost.
你输了。¤you lose.
回去复命吧。¤Go back to life.
你在药园之中来回巡视。¤You are patrolling in the pharmacy.
不愧是我{SayStcVal=928}的药田，灵气之浓郁，吐纳都顺畅了几分。¤It deserves to be my {SayStcVal=928} medicinal field. The aura is so strong that I feel a little smoother.
哼，这点实力也敢来打扰本座清修？¤This is the first time I've ever seen this.
但别说回应，四近连蝉鸣鸟叫，妖兽呼嚎皆是难察，反倒是有微风轻拂木叶之声传入你耳中。¤But not to mention the response, four near even cicadas chirping birds, Spirit Beasts howling are difficult to detect, but rather the sound of the breeze flicking wood leaves into your ears.
只要别拖太久，被发现就好。¤As long as it doesn't take too long, it's fine to be discovered.
咳，咳咳，道友，不，前，前辈，我这就把秘术交予你，请，咳咳咳，饶我一命。¤Cough, cough, fellow Daoist, no, former, senior, I will hand over the secret technique to you, please, cough, cough, spare my life.
但只三息时间，那妖人如烂泥般瘫倒在地。在你犹豫着是否要上前查看之时，他的躯壳更是如同体内灵气被引爆一般，炸裂开来。¤But only three breaths of time, the monster collapsed to the ground like mud. When you were hesitating whether to go forward to check, his body exploded as if the aura in his body had been detonated.
估摸着他不一定将秘术放在储物袋内，于是你也不急着了结此人，而是打算等他交出秘术后再动手。既可夺得秘术，又不会让星铃儿反感，称得上是一举两得。¤It is estimated that he does not necessarily put the secret technique in the storage bag, so you are not in a hurry to end this person, but plan to wait for him to hand over the secret technique before starting. It can win the secret technique without making Xing Linger disgusted. It can be said to kill two birds with one stone.
此人出手极快，连我也未能察觉他潜伏在附近。说不定是那女娃娃的前辈师尊一类。¤This person is extremely fast, even I did not detect him lurking around. Maybe the girl doll's predecessor master class.
敢问阁下是何人？¤Dare I ask who you are?
怀着对本座的畏惧逝去吧！磔磔磔！¤Pass away with the fear of this seat! (Jubilee) Jubilee!
两三息之后，这妖人便是软倒在地，再无声息。似乎是已经死去。¤Two or three breaths later, the demon was soft on the ground, no more sound. It seems to be dead.
先不说残骸四散险些波及你，他身上及周遭的储物袋等物事更是不保。¤Not to mention that the scattered wreckage will almost affect you, and the storage bags and other things around him are even more unsafe.
你对着这“邪教教主”的残骸僵持一会后，见确是无人出声，便试探着走出大殿，而后四处寻找星铃儿的身影。¤After you were deadlocked for a while at the wreckage of the cult leader, seeing that no one had spoken, you tentatively walked out of the hall, and then looked around for Xing Linger's figure.
但未等他出手，一道惨白光芒从门外激射而入，你还未来得及反应已是没入那跪服在地的妖人眉心，后者当即如承受万蛊噬心般惨叫连连。¤But not waiting for his hand, a tragic white light from the door shot in, you have not had time to react has been into that kneeling in the ground of the demon eyebrows, the latter immediately as bear ten thousand parasites devouring the heart like screaming.
可此处哪还有那妮子的踪影。久寻不得后，你也只好悻悻离去。¤But there is no trace of that girl here. After being unable to find it for a long time, you had no choice but to leave.
既然前辈不愿现身，我也没必要在此久留了。去星铃儿道友那边看看吧。¤Since the seniors do not want to show up, I do not need to stay here for a long time. Let's go to Daoist Starling's side.
请问是哪位前辈出手相助？晚辈感激不尽！¤May I ask which senior came to my aid? I am grateful!
也好，本座就拿你来树立声威好了！¤Well, I'll use you to build prestige!
但别说回应，四近连蝉鸣鸟叫，妖兽呼嚎都不可闻，甚至风声都停滞下来，可谓是寂静异常。¤But not to mention the response, there were cicadas and birds chirping all around, the howls of monsters were inaudible, and even the sound of the wind stopped, it was an abnormal silence.
突如其来的状况让你也是为之一惊！¤The sudden situation will surprise you!
（解决了，快去星道友那边看看吧。）¤(It's resolved, I should go meet up with fellow Daoist Star.
嗯，星铃儿说奉门派之命前来，有个前辈暗中守护倒也不无可能。¤Well, Starling said that she came here on the order of the sect, and it is not impossible that there is a senior who is secretly guarding.
算你识相。¤Count you acquainted.
只见一道惨白光芒从门外激射而入，你还未来得及反应已是没入那跪服在地的妖人眉心，后者当即如承受万蛊噬心般惨叫连连。¤Only to see a tragic white light from outside the door shot in, you have not had time to react is into the kneeling demon brow, the latter immediately as suffering a million compulsions devouring the heart like screaming.
我于阵法一途钻研多年，如今略有小成。你可有兴趣挑战一番？¤I have been studying the formation for many years, and now I have a little success. Are you interested in challenging it?
只不过前提是——你就如此袖手离去。¤It's just the premise-you just leave with nothing.
你觉得堂堂{$shili}也不过如此，兴致缺缺的离开了。¤You think Tangtang {$shili} is nothing more than that, and I left without interest.
晚辈来这{$shili}原意也不过是借贵派神通功法一观，只不过此间修士不由分说便是驱逐晚辈，才不得已催动功法自卫，若是前辈能让晚辈如愿，自然会就此离去。¤The original intention of the younger generation {$shili} was just to take a look at the noble magical powers. It's just that the cultivators here are involuntarily expelling the younger generations, and have no choice but to urge the younger generations to defend themselves. If the seniors can make the younger generations do what they want, they will naturally leave. go with.
呵呵，{$shili}有难，老朽出手自是理所应当，不过这宁州如今是风起云涌，怕是在不久后会有偌大变故，老朽还指着用这把老骨头再为宁州出点力。¤Hehe, {$shili} is in trouble. The old man should take his action. However, this Ning Province is now surging, and I am afraid that there will be a big change in the near future. The old man still points to using this old bone to make a point for Ning Province. force.
不如{$称呼}就此离去，老朽也就当这徒孙是与人切磋时被失手击杀，不再过多追究。也让老朽得以在此界再停留几日，可好？¤It would be better if {$title} left here, and the old man was killed by mistake when this disciple and grandson were sparring with others, and no longer pursued too much. It also allows the old man to stay in this world for a few more days, okay?
附近重伤的{$shili}修士无不是一脸愤懑的看着你。明明上门抢夺功法，却还不动声色的将责任推到受害者身上，他们即便是修练数百年，也未曾见过如此厚颜无耻之人。¤The {$shili} cultivators who were seriously injured nearby all looked at you with angrily. They clearly came to steal the exercises, but they calmly pushed the blame on the victims. Even if they have been practicing for hundreds of years, they have never Have seen such a brazen person.
好说好说。¤It's easy to talk.
但还未等你高兴，更强的{$shili}修士已然到场。问清情形后，也不磨叽，直接催动神通向你袭来。¤But before you are happy, the stronger {$shili} cultivator has already arrived. After asking about the situation, he didn't grind, and directly urged the magical power to attack you.
这就化神了？改存档了吧？¤Is this Deity Transformation? Is it saved?
在你强大的实力下，这场战斗被迅速结束了，以至于{$shili}的修士还没来得及通知宗内强者。¤Under your powerful strength, this battle was quickly ended, so that the cultivator of {$shili} had not had time to inform the strong in the sect.
缠斗几回合后，你佯装强攻卖了个破绽，对手如你所料全力进攻。躲过迎面而来的神通后，你趁对方还未反应过来便是全力爆发，终于是结束了这场战斗。¤After a few rounds of fighting, you pretended to attack and sold a flaw, and your opponent attacked with all strength as you expected. After avoiding the oncoming magical powers, you burst out with all strength before the opponent reacted, and finally ended the game. fighting.
此人仅是袖手站在死去的元婴修士旁，身上没有半分灵气或是神识波动，仿若一个普通凡人，但你却感觉到此间万物都会受他驱使。¤This person is just standing next to the dead Yuanying cultivator with arms folded. There is no aura or divine consciousness fluctuations in his body, just like an ordinary mortal, but you feel that everything here will be driven by him.
{$称呼}，就此罢手吧。¤{$title}, let's stop there.
纵有守山大阵作为倚仗，{$shili}的元婴修士也终于还是倒在你手下，落得个阵毁人亡的下场。\n好在除作为阵眼的元婴修士之外，一众修士最多是身负重伤，倒也保得性命无虞。{$shili}还留有重建阵法然后迅速补充实力如初的可能。¤Even with the guarding mountain formation as a reliance, {$shili}'s Yuanying cultivator finally fell under your hands, and ended up in a ruined battle. \nFortunately, apart from the Yuanying cultivator who was the front of the battle, A group of cultivators were seriously injured at best, but they also saved their lives. {$shili} still has the possibility of rebuilding the formation and quickly replenishing the strength as before.
在他的示意下，纵是不乐意，{$shili}幸存的长老也只得派一人带你前往藏经阁。¤Under his sign, even if he is not happy, the surviving elders of {$shili} have to send one person to take you to the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion.
糟糕，看来你拿走的碎壳是整个海底阵法的支点。现在没有了阵法的压制，无尽海渊的灵力乱流很快就会把这里毁掉。¤Oops, it seems that the broken shell you took is the fulcrum of the entire seabed array. Now that there is no suppression of the formation, the turbulent spiritual power of the endless sea will soon destroy this place.
难怪区区海兽能够有如此高深的阵法造诣，恐怕就是从这片碎壳之中感悟而来的。¤It is no wonder that the mere sea beasts can have such profound formation skills, I am afraid that it is from this fragment of the shell.
你看着碎壳上的灵纹，竟不由自主的陷入了一种顿悟的状态...¤When you look at the spirit pattern on the broken shell, you can't help but fall into a state of epiphany...
九幽狡猾无比，这次你没有再给他逃跑的机会，而是一剑彻底的将他的元神剿灭。¤Jiuyou is extremely cunning, this time you did not give him another chance to escape, but completely wiped out his primordial spirit with a single sword.
随着九幽气息渐渐消散，另一股轻微的灵力波动引起了你的注意。你顺着灵力感应，在九幽遗骸下方的阵法中心，找到了一块被嵌入其中的碎壳。¤As the aura of Jiuyou gradually dissipated, another slight fluctuation of spiritual power caught your attention. Following your spiritual sense, you found a broken shell embedded in the center of the formation below the remains of Jiuyou.
这碎壳上铭刻的灵纹似乎颇为玄妙，是阵法么？¤The spirit pattern engraved on this broken shell seems to be quite mysterious, is it a formation?
快离开这里！¤Get out of here!
这碎壳，究竟是...¤What is this broken shell...
不...这不...可能...¤No...it's not...probably...
正当你沉浸于感悟中时，整个海底巢穴开始剧烈震动起来，以九幽残骸为中心，一个巨大的漩涡逐渐形成。¤Just when you were immersed in your perception, the entire underwater lair began to vibrate violently, and a huge vortex gradually formed with the wreckage of the Nine Serenities as the center.
九幽的瞳孔逐渐黯淡，漫天挥舞的巨大触手跌落在地。一代妖圣，就此陨落...¤Jiuyou's pupils gradually dimmed, and the huge tentacles waving all over the sky fell to the ground. A generation of demon saints has fallen...
看，这碎壳上铭刻的灵纹和我们刚刚遇到的那个四象聚灵阵好像是一样的！¤Look, the spirit pattern inscribed on this broken shell seems to be the same as the four-image gathering spirit formation we just encountered!
人类与妖兽不同，各家族，门派势力在千万年来都留下了大量的功法传承。¤Humans are different from monsters. Various families and sects have left a large number of inheritances of exercises for thousands of years.
九幽大圣...的确是不值一提。大圣可能还不知道，前段时间...¤Jiuyou Dasheng... is indeed not worth mentioning. The Great Sage may not know yet, some time ago...
这幻雾境只是本座日常修炼吐纳时自动形成的，并非刻意操控。不过即便如此，也不是一般人可以随随便便就破解的。¤This phantom fog state is only automatically formed during the daily practice of this seat, and it is not deliberately manipulated. But even so, it is not something that ordinary people can easily crack.
本座平日在幻雾境隐修，极少离开吞云海，对于那些虚无飘渺的海上传闻了解的倒是不多。¤I usually practice seclusion in the Illusory Mist Realm and rarely leave the Sea of ​​Swallowing Clouds, so I don’t know much about those ethereal sea rumors.
我们吞云蟒一族，与你们人类突破的方式虽说大不相同，却也殊途同归。¤Our cloud swallowing python family, although the way of breaking through is very different from your human beings, but also the same goal.
哈哈哈，你们人类虽说先天天赋不足，但潜力却也是最大的。小友能有如今修为，想必也有不少奇遇与感悟吧。¤Hahaha, although you humans lack innate talent, you have the greatest potential. The little friend who can have the current cultivation base must have many adventures and insights.
大圣既然可以化为人形，可有兴趣到人类的世界游历一番？¤Since the Great Sage can be transformed into a human form, are you interested in traveling in the human world?
你同吞云大圣聊起了之前没有提到过的成长经历，又讲到海上的奇闻异事。只见吞云大圣时而点头附和、时而质疑询问，时而释然发笑，竟是听的格外认真。¤You and the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud talked about the growth experience that you have not mentioned before, and also talked about the anecdotes at sea. I saw the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud sometimes nodding in agreement, sometimes questioning and asking, sometimes laughing with relief, but he listened very seriously.
有一定修炼资质的人便会被各势力收入门下，从最基础的功法学起，便算是踏入仙途了。¤Those who have certain cultivation qualifications will be admitted to the sect of various forces, starting from the most basic exercises, they can be regarded as stepping into the fairyland.
本座虽已突破化神，但对于水道与气道以外的其它大道仍是一窍不通，不知从何入手。¤Although this seat has broken through to Deity Transformation, he still knows nothing about other avenues other than the water channel and the air channel, and I don't know where to start.
说着，你便运起了幻雾法门，展示给吞云大圣。¤With that, you transported the Illusionary Mist Technique and showed it to the Great Sage Swallowing Clouds.
当年，我以一本最为基础的《吐纳功法》进入了修真者的行列，如今……¤Back then, I entered the ranks of cultivators with one of the most basic books, Tuna Kungfu, and now...
只见吞云大圣运起了不知名的云雾功法，瞬间周遭云雾缭绕。你一边观察着这云雾的走向，一边向他请教，感触颇深。¤I saw that the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud had used an unknown cloud and fog technique, and the surrounding clouds and fog were Shielded in an instant. While observing the direction of the cloud and mist, you asked him for advice, which was deeply touched.
哈哈哈，{$chenghu}有所不知，我们吞云蟒一族身具上古神兽玄武之血脉，天生便对操控水雾之道领悟极高。¤Hahaha, {$chenghu} doesn't know anything, our Cloud Swallowing Pythons have the bloodline of the ancient mythical beast Black Tortoise, and we are born with a very high understanding of the way of controlling water mist.
确实……人妖殊途。无论如何，如果最终不能飞升，也只是空忙活一场。¤Indeed... Humans and demons have different paths. In any case, if you can't ascend it's pointless all the same.
领悟神通：{color=#d0380a}雾隐术{/color}¤Comprehend supernatural powers: {color=#d0380a}Mist Hidden Technique{/color}
我族世代在此修炼，无论功法、修行方式还是此地灵气都是最为适合我族的。¤My clan has cultivated here for generations, no matter the practice method, practice method or the spiritual energy of this place is the most suitable for my clan.
人类修士虽说各系大道皆可参悟，但许多人终其一生也只是初窥门径而已，如何比的上大圣。¤Although human cultivators can comprehend the Dao of all departments, many people only have a first glimpse of the door throughout their lives, how can they be compared to the Great Sage.
即便是第一次尝试突破失败了，也已初具仙格，日后再次尝试突破，成功的机会便会高上一些。¤Even if the first attempt to break through fails, it has already begun to take shape. If you try to break through again in the future, the chance of success will be higher.
我想，在天劫来临前，我们应该尽可能提升自己的境界。境界越高，能够成功飞升的机会也一定会更高。¤I think, before the catastrophe comes, we should improve our realm as much as possible. The higher the realm, the higher the chance of being able to successfully ascend.
不过百余年前，本座曾与那无尽海渊的九幽大圣起过一些冲突。只是没想到同为化神期修为，他居然未曾出手便逃回他的老巢去了。如此一来，本座倒也不屑于再与他有何争斗了。¤But more than a hundred years ago, this seat had some conflicts with the Nine Nether Great Sage of the endless sea. It was just that he didn't expect that he was in the same Deity Transformation stage, and he actually fled back to his old nest without taking a shot. In this way, this seat doesn't bother to fight with him any more.
我也曾学过一门神通，唤作幻雾术，想来倒是与大圣的吐纳术有几分相似之处。¤I have also learned a magical power called Illusion Mist Technique, which is somewhat similar to the Great Sage's Breathing Technique.
想不到人类的世界还有这么多趣事，不错……不错。¤Unexpectedly, there are so many interesting things in the human world, not bad... not bad.
人类的世界固然有趣，对于我来说却也只能作为修炼之余的消遣罢了，只有早日飞升才是正途。¤The human world is interesting, but for me, it can only be used as a pastime after cultivation. The only way is to ascend as soon as possible.
你同吞云大圣聊起了你在宁州的成长经历，又讲到海上的奇闻异事。只见吞云大圣时而点头附和、时而质疑询问，时而释然发笑，竟是听的格外认真。¤You chatted with the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud about your growth experience in Ning Province, and also talked about anecdotes at sea. I saw the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud sometimes nodding in agreement, sometimes questioning and asking, sometimes laughing with relief, but he listened very seriously.
这是为何？¤Why is this?
有趣...有趣...未曾想到人类也能掌握此等操控云雾的神通，似与我族功法同源，但也有一些独特的变化。¤Interesting...Interesting...I never thought that humans could also master such magical powers to manipulate clouds. It seems to have the same origin as my family's practice, but there are also some unique changes.
难怪本座察觉无尽海渊似乎有了一些异动...¤It's no wonder that this seat noticed that there seemed to be some changes in the endless sea abyss...
就我而言，化神期与过往其它境界是完全不同的。此前突破至化神中期，为我带来的提升已远超过去所有突破的总和。¤As far as I'm concerned, the Deity Transformation Stage is completely different from other realms in the past. The previous breakthrough to the middle stage of Deity Transformation has brought me far more improvement than the sum of all the previous breakthroughs.
{$chenghu}想问何事？¤What is {$chenghu} wanting to ask?
不错，若道友日后若遇到新的奇闻异事，还请务必来此地分享一番。¤Yes, if fellow Daoists encounter new anecdotes in the future, please be sure to share them here.
你将自己在无尽海渊斩杀九幽大圣一事向吞云一一道来...¤You brought your own killing of the Great Sage Jiuyou in the endless sea to the swallowing cloud one by one...
（摇了摇头）虽然你所描述的世界很有趣，可惜并不适合我。¤(shakes head) While the world you describe is interesting, unfortunately it doesn't suit me.
小友还未突破化神，想必对于天劫之事还不太清楚。等小友成功突破后，自然能感应到日后天劫降临的时间。¤The little friend has not yet broken through the Deity Transformation, so he must not know much about the calamity. After the little friend successfully breaks through, he will naturally be able to sense the time when the catastrophe will come in the future.
你向吞云大圣作了一揖，便意犹未尽地离开了此地。此番奇遇，你只觉受益匪浅。¤You bowed to the Great Sage Swallowing Clouds, and left the place with no end in sight. You only feel that you have benefited a lot from this adventure.
当年，我以家族遗留的一本《五府锻元决》进入了修真者的行列，如今……¤Back then, I entered the ranks of cultivators with a copy of the Five Palaces Forging Yuan Jue left by my family, and now...
那九幽虽说实力不如我，但毕竟也是化神期妖圣...真没想到{$chenghu}居然有这样的实力。¤Although that Jiuyou is not as strong as me, but after all, he is also a demon sage at the Deity Transformation stage... I didn't expect {$chenghu} to have such strength.
所谓的化神，实际便是蜕凡化仙的过程。小友只需在突破的过程中，细细体会仙凡之别。¤The so-called Deity Transformation is actually the process of transforming from mortal to an immortal. Little friends only need to experience the difference between immortals and ordinary people in the process of breakthrough.
不错，你们人类的功法确实种类繁多，可惜大部分并非妖兽能够修炼的。¤Yes, there are indeed many kinds of cultivation techniques of your human beings, but unfortunately most of them cannot be cultivated by monsters.
人类修炼的方式与我族大相径庭，我族天生便有吞云吐雾的本领，通过吐纳感悟灵气与云雾的流动，便可悟得水气之道。¤The way of human cultivation is very different from that of our family. Our family is born with the ability to swallow clouds and mists.
人类若想感悟大道，就必须抓住日常奇遇与论道交流时灵光一闪所得到的思绪，潜心感悟数十年时间，方能有所成就。¤If human beings want to comprehend the Dao, they must grasp the thoughts obtained by the flash of inspiration during daily adventures and discussions on Dao, and concentrate on comprehension for decades before they can achieve anything.
今日当真所谈甚欢。大圣要专心修炼，在下便不打扰大圣了，有缘再会。¤Really enjoyed it today. The great sage should concentrate on his cultivation, and he will not disturb the great sage.
道友既已突破化神，想必对于天劫已经也感应。¤Since fellow Daoists have broken through into Deity Transformation, they must have already sensed the calamity.
你二人又聊起了其它{color=#d0380a}海域奇闻{/color}，{color=#d0380a}人生大道{/color}...你只觉仙路漫漫，命途多舛。良久，你们不约而同地陷入了沉默，你便知道，大概到了分别的时候。¤The two of you talked about other {color=#d0380a}anecdotes from the sea{/color}, {color=#d0380a}the road of life{/color}... You only feel that the road to immortality is long and the fate is ill-fated. For a long time, you fell into silence at the same time, and you knew that it was probably time to part.
不知你们人类修士又是如何开始修炼的？¤I wonder how your human cultivators started to cultivate?
这就是诞生自九霄雷狱的雷灵吧，观其灵气波动足以匹配元婴后期强者。¤This is the thunder spirit born from the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, right? Looking at its aura fluctuation is enough to match that of a late YuanYing powerhouse.
一团雷电在云中若隐若现的闪动，一阵阵先天灵气从它身上散发而出。¤A ball of thunder and lightning flickers faintly in the clouds, and a burst of innate aura emanates from it.
道友目前在千流岛已小有名气，出于对道友实力的慎重考虑，我们的赔率将会下调些许，望道友见谅。¤Daoists are now well-known in Qianliu Island. Due to careful consideration of the strengths of Taoists, our odds will be lowered a bit. I hope Taoists will forgive me.
道友真是修为过人，这是你的押注。¤Fellow Daoist is really an extraordinary cultivation base, this is your bet.
道友还是勤加修炼后再来参赛吧。¤Daoists should practice diligently before coming to the competition.
“噗”的一声巨响传来，只见滚滚黑雾从九幽大圣体内不断喷出，翻滚着将他笼罩在其中。¤The actual poof a loud sound came, only to see rolling black fog from the body of the great saint of the nine ghosts constantly spewing out, tumbling to envelop him in it.
不好，他是要逃跑！¤Not good, he is trying to escape!
这黑雾不仅能阻挡视线，还有遮蔽神识的效果，一时之间让你无法辨别九幽所处的方位。¤This black fog not only blocks vision, but also has the effect of obscuring soul sense, making it impossible for you to discern the location of Jiu Yu for a while.
你连掐法诀，冲进黑雾之中，向着海底追了过去...¤You even pinched a magic trick, rushed into the black fog and chased towards the bottom of the sea...
人类...本座...倒是小瞧你了...¤Humans... This seat... I have underestimated you...
......我还是第一次见到有人用灵气火焰烤肉的，看在你让我大开眼界的份儿上就不要你赔我的兔肉了。¤...This is the first time I have seen someone grilling meat with Reiki flames. Since you have opened my eyes, I don't want you to pay for my rabbit meat.
你觉得此人十分眼熟，但又一时想不起来她是谁。¤You think this person is very familiar, but you can't remember who she is for a while.
篝火升起来了，你要把肉架在什么地方呢？¤The campfire is rising, where are you going to put the meat?
好你个{FirstName}{LastName}！英杰会上的事倒是全忘光了！¤Well, you {FirstName}{LastName}! I forgot all about the Yingjie meeting!
她掀开锅盖，一股浓郁的肉香从锅里传来，本不怎么饥饿的你此刻也被勾起了食欲。¤She lifted the lid of the pot, and a strong smell of meat came from the pot, and you, who were not very hungry, were also aroused at this moment.
用什么来烤肉呢？¤What do you use for barbecue?
看起来兔肉快烤好了，你决定¤It looks like the rabbit meat is almost ready, you decide
你见着时机差不多时开炉取丹，几颗飘着烤肉香气的丹药被你收入瓶中。¤You saw that the time was about to open the furnace to get the pill, and you put a few pills with the aroma of barbecue into the bottle.
不用放在心上，先前见过你一面，我对自己的记忆力还是很有信心的。¤Don't take it to heart. Once I saw you before, I still have confidence in my memory.
偷偷摸摸不像好人！说！你在这里准备干什么！¤It's not like a good person to be sneaky! Say! What are you going to do here!
我想得果然没错，这锅汤闻起来就好喝。¤I thought it was right, this pot of soup smells good.
你找了一棵高大的树木，躺在粗壮的树枝上美美地睡了一觉。¤You found a tall tree and lay on a thick branch and slept beautifully.
要不要换个角度再看看呢？你看了看周围，再回过头时却发现篝火旁的人不见了。¤Would you like to look at it from another angle? You look around, and when you look back, you find that the people by the campfire are gone.
放什么调料进去呢？¤What kind of seasoning should I put in?
你用随身携带的小刀割下一块兔肉递给林沐心，她迫不及待地接了过去。¤You cut a piece of rabbit meat with the knife you carried and handed it to Lin Muxin. She couldn't wait to take it.
来的路上宰了只兔妖，肥硕又壮实，看起来就肉质鲜美。¤A rabbit demon was killed on the way here. It was fat and sturdy, and it looked delicious.
你将手中的丹药递给林沐心，她面色古怪地坐在一旁，看起来似乎在犹豫要不要接过来。¤You pass the pill in your hand to Lin Muxin, and she sits aside with a weird expression, seeming to be hesitant to take it.
呸呸呸！你烤的这也叫肉？¤Bah, baah! This is also called meat?
呕——¤vomit--
吃饱喝足后，你们轮流守夜直到天亮。¤After eating and drinking, you take turns to watch the night until dawn.
你半信半疑地将丹药放进了嘴里。¤You dubiously put the pill into your mouth.
你恍然大悟，连忙叫出她的名字。¤It suddenly dawned on you, and you called out her name quickly.
你提气轻身，悄悄地靠了过去。只看到燃起的篝火上似乎架了一口锅，把后面的人挡了个严实。¤You lifted up your breath and leaned in quietly. You only saw a pot on the burning campfire, blocking the people behind.
她叹着气给你盛了碗热汤，端起自己的汤碗小心地喝了起来。¤She sighed and filled you with a bowl of hot soup, picked up her soup bowl and drank it carefully.
“还是假装没听见吧......”¤Pretend that you didn't hear it...
唉，一个人历练就是麻烦，要是有个厨娘跟着就好了......¤Oh, it’s trouble to experience alone, if only a cook would follow...
你讪讪地喝了一口，浓汤的鲜美让你忘记了丹药的怪味。¤You take a sip, the deliciousness of the thick soup makes you forget the peculiar smell of the pill.
你先坐，我得看一眼锅里的汤。¤You sit down first, I have to take a look at the soup in the pot.
不远处的丛林仿佛闪烁着点点火光，或许是和你相同的在林中落脚的修士，要过去看看吗？¤The forest not far away seems to be shining a little light. Maybe it is the same cultivator who settled in the forest like you. Would you like to go over and take a look?
怎么是你？¤why you?
真是无巧不成书，哈哈。¤It's no coincidence that a book is impossible, haha.
我叫驯养的灵兽烤肉都比你做得好吃！¤My tamed spirit beast barbecue is better than yours!
哇！好香啊！没想到你厨艺这么棒，看来找你烤肉真是个正确的决定！¤Wow! It smells so good! I didn't expect your cooking skills to be so good. It seems that looking for your barbecue is really the right decision!
天色渐晚，最后一丝阳光消失在密林茂盛的枝叶中时你停下赶路的脚步，打算暂时在林中某棵大树上休憩。¤It's getting late, and when the last ray of sunlight disappears in the lush branches and leaves of the dense forest, you stopped walking, intending to rest on a big tree in the forest temporarily.
不用担心，炼丹我很擅长的。¤Don't worry, I am very good at alchemy.
我叫林沐心，走吧，我们去那边聊。¤My name is Lin Muxin, let's go, let's talk over there.
我赶路到这片林子打算休息时看到前面有火光，一时好奇就过来打探打探......¤I rushed to this forest when I was about to take a break and saw a fire in front of me, so I came over to inquire about it when I was curious...
像是做出了什么极为重大的决定一样，她屏住呼吸吞下了你递来的丹药。¤Like an extremely important decision, she held her breath and swallowed the pill you handed over.
你看得眼睛都直了，哈哈！¤You make your eyes straight, haha!
你讪讪地喝了一口，浓汤的鲜美不禁让你为化成灰的那些兔肉感到惋惜。¤You took a sip, and the delicacy of the soup makes you feel sorry for the rabbit meat that has turned to ashes.
给你，尝尝看吧。¤Here you are, try it.
谁担心这个啊......¤Who is worried about this...
我还有要事在身，先行一步。¤I still have something to do, so I'll be one step ahead.
林沐心看了看坐在一旁的你，噗嗤一声笑了出来。¤Lin Muxin looked at you who was sitting on the side, and let out a chuckle.
林沐心的脸色这才好看了一些，摆了摆手示意你去篝火那边。¤Lin Muxin's expression looks better now, and she waved her hand for you to go to the campfire.
你转过身去，借着微弱的火光看清了面前的女子。¤You turned around and saw the woman in front of you clearly through the faint light of fire.
走吧，我们去篝火那边坐着聊。¤Let's go, let's sit and talk over the campfire.
一颗丹药而已，不至于这么难吃吧？¤It's just a pill, it shouldn't be so unpalatable, right?
熟练地打开炉子，将肉和调料丢进去，你盘坐在一旁等待丹成。¤Open the stove skillfully, throw in the meat and spices, you sit around and wait for Dan Cheng.
你打开储物袋，从里面掏出了炼丹炉。¤You opened the storage bag and took out the alchemy furnace from it.
要在生火前先把兔肉腌制一下吗？¤Should you marinate the rabbit meat before starting the fire?
不管怎么说，谢谢你昨天的烤肉。¤Anyway, thank you for the barbecue yesterday.
想喝也可以，调料在柴火那，帮我把剩下的兔肉烤了吧。¤You can drink it if you want, the seasoning is at the firewood, and help me roast the remaining rabbit meat.
你目送着林沐心朝你来时的路走去，似乎还能听见她小声嘀咕着什么。¤You watched Lin Muxin walk towards the way you came, and it seems that you can still hear her whispering something.
嗯...肉汁浓郁，外焦里嫩，调料的用量也刚刚好。这只兔子死得其所，真是太好吃啦！¤Um... the gravy is rich, the outside is charred and the inside is tender, and the amount of seasoning is just right. This rabbit died well, it's so delicious!
没有没有，林沐心这个名字我记得很清楚！¤No no, I remember the name Lin Muxin very clearly!
你运起灵气，凝聚出一团火焰。孰知用力过猛，兔肉一靠上去便化成了黑灰。¤You lifted your aura and condensed a ball of flame. If you know that if you use too much force, the rabbit meat will turn into black and gray as soon as you lean on it.
手艺不错嘛！不过还有进步空间！¤The craftsmanship is good! But there is room for improvement!
星河剑派历史最悠久的当属剑派，莫被些旁门左道迷花眼睛。¤The Galaxy Sword Sect has the longest history. It's the Sword Sect. Don't be fooled by the sidelines.
清月潭玄妙无比，每个内门弟子都曾于此地获益。¤QingYue lake is extremely mysterious and every inner disciple has benefited from this place.
唉，只怪天道无常，我再另寻他法吧。¤Alas, I blame the way of heavens, I will find another way.
唉？...这是什么？¤Huh?...what is this?
方才你那寒玉损了我的本源，故此现今只能分你几片叶子，好镇压住你师妹体内的毒素。¤Just now your cold jade damaged my origin, so now I can only divide a few leaves from you, so as to suppress the toxins in your junior sister's body.
你察觉到宁紫馨的异样，正要出言阻拦时一道火光燃起。跳动的火焰中宁紫馨的身形若隐若现，她神色恬淡，不同于你们相见时的曲意逢迎，仿佛是迎来真正的解脱般轻笑着。¤You perceive the strangeness of Ning Zixin, and a flame ignites when you are about to stop speaking. In the beating flame, Ning Zixin's figure is looming, and her expression is calm, different from the welcoming mood when you met, as if welcoming. Come and chuckle like a real relief.
唉...世间安得两全法，时也，命也。¤Oh...It's just too hard to find a perfect solution in this world, whether it's time or fate.
“还不是刚才你那一下子给人家留下心理阴影了......”¤It's not that you left a psychological shadow on others just now...
你们正欲上前查看时，宁紫馨的身体化作点点光芒，消散在了空气中。¤When you were about to step forward to check, Ning Zixin's body turned into a little light and disappeared into the air.
诶?赠与我？¤Eh? Gifted to me?
什么也没留下？这可怎么办？！¤Nothing left? What can I do?!
哦，多谢。¤Oh, thanks a lot.
想要完全清除的话可配以玉髓芝和风灵花。¤Hmm if it to be removed completely, you would need Jadecore Shroom and Wispfey Flower as replacements.
这火麟玉乃是阿姊偶然所得的宝物，今日就赠与你，以报指点之恩。¤This Fire Forest Jade is a treasure that my sister got by chance, so I will give it to you today in return for your guidance.
此恨绵绵...无绝期......¤This hatred is endless...without expiration...
我苦了五百年，恨了五百年，怨了五百年，没想到最后被你二人一语破道。¤I have suffered for five hundred years, hated for five hundred years, and complained for five hundred years. I didn't expect to be broken by the two of you in the end.
师妹......师妹有救了！¤Junior sister...Junior sister is saved!
阿姊，我这就来寻你们了......¤Sister, I'm here to find you...
我轮得到你来可怜么？用不得你们动手，我自己来！¤Is it my turn to be pitiful? You don't have to do it, I will do it myself!
后面那个畏畏缩缩的小子，你且过来。¤The cowering kid behind, come here.
正如李道友所讲，未来的路在你自己脚下。要光复你香薷一族还是亡命于我这剑下，你自己选择吧。¤As Li Daoyou said, the road to the future lies at your own feet. If you want to regain your fragrant clan or desperate under my sword, you can choose for yourself.
许是因为心中仍有善念，那火并没有烧去她的本体。待火光消散，一株宁州香薷静静地落在地面上。¤Xu was because there was still kind thoughts in her heart, and the fire did not burn her body. When the fire dissipated, a plant of Ning Province Fragrant stalk fell quietly on the ground.
在下替师妹谢过姑娘！¤I thanked the girl for the junior sister!
如此我便先行离去替师妹解毒，多谢{FirstName}{xiongdi}出手相助！¤So I will leave first to detoxify the younger sister, thank you {FirstName}{xiongdi} for your help!
叫你过来你就过来，婆婆妈妈像什么男人？¤If you ask you to come over, come here, what kind of man do mothers-in-laws look like?
我也有宝物赠与{gongzi}。¤I also have treasures for {gongzi}.
原来那青蛇劲是前辈留在阵中的传承...¤It turns out Lord Azure Snake was the one who left this skill in the array...
莫非你在幻雾阵中，领悟了我当年留下的传承？¤Could it be you obtained the inheritance I left behind in the Mirage Mist Array?
这竹山宗内的毒经也差不多被我学尽了，若有机会，倒是还想见识一番巫山的毒蛊之术。¤I have almost exhausted the poison scriptures in the Bamboo Mountain Sect. If I have the opportunity, I would like to see Wushan's Poison Gu technique.
青麟这小子就是太照顾他那些不成器的师弟师妹了，否则又怎么会让离火门的人在试炼里占尽了上风。¤Qinglin, this kid is taking too much care of his ineffective juniors and sisters, otherwise, how could he let Heavenly Fire Gate gain the upper hand in the trial.
原来那青蛇劲是师傅留在阵中的传承...¤It turns out that the Azure Snake Art is the legacy left by master in the array...
哈哈哈，如此也算缘分，这样吧，我便把我当年自创的《青蛇要诀》一并传授于你，希望对你有所帮助。¤Hahaha, this must be fate! Let me impart the Azure Snake Sutra that I created back in the day to you, I hope it will be helpful.
嗯...你身上的印记？¤Hm..? That mark on your body...
哈哈哈，如此也算缘分，这样，我正好把我当年自创的《青蛇要诀》一并传授于你，你可要好好修炼。¤Hahaha, seems to be fate then, alright, I will also teach you the Green Snake Technique that I created back then, you should practice it well.
天魔眼中的魔物最多也不过是地魔一级，灵智又低，算不得多难对付。¤The monster in the eyes of the sky demon is at most the first level of the earth demon, with low intelligence and not too difficult to deal with.
感激不尽！我名李相书，下一个目的地是{color=#d0380a}武陵城{/color}，道友若有消息可去客栈寻我。¤I am grateful! My name is Li Xiangshu, and my next destination is {color=#d0380a}Wuling City{/color}. If you have any news, you can go to the inn to find me.
云汐城的中草堂或许有此物的记载，我回去翻找一番。¤The middle cottage in Yunxi City may have a record of this. I will go back and search for it.
实不相瞒，我同师妹前些日子误入上古遗迹。本是福缘美事，熟料那洞府竟处处藏毒。¤Actually, my junior sister and I strayed into the ancient ruins a few days ago. It was a blessing and a beautiful thing, and the clinker cave house is hiding poison everywhere.
道友莫怪，我左思右想实在不知从何说起，只得先问了这么奇怪的问题。¤No wonder Daoist friends, I really don't know where to start, I have to ask such a strange question first.
我二人步步为营，师妹却还是被毒所伤。她出来时面色便欠佳，现在......唉......¤My two are working together, but the younger sister is still injured by the poison. She looked bad when she came out, and now... alas...
宗门的藏经阁或许有此物的记载，我回去翻找一番。¤The Zongmen's Tibetan Scripture Pavilion may have a record of this, I will go back and look for it.
既是如此，不如我便陪你一同寻找，也开开眼界。¤Since this is the case, it's better for me to accompany you to find it together, and it also opens my eyes.
李兄可唤我{FirstName}{LastName}，那么暂此别过。¤Brother Li can call me {FirstName}{LastName}, so goodbye now.
我也是在其中偶然得知有味与火铜伴生的草药或能解此毒，便寻了大半宁州打探它的消息。¤I also accidentally learned that the herbal medicine associated with fire copper might be able to detoxify the poison, so I searched for most of Ning Province to find out about it.
说来话长，道友可听说过与{color=#d0380a}火铜{/color}伴生的植物？¤It's a long story. Have fellow daoists heard of the plants that are associated with {color=#d0380a}fire copper{/color}?
一位衣着朴素的修士唉声叹气地坐在路旁，看起来十分困扰。{w}{w=0.5}¤A simple-dressed cultivator sat by the roadside with a sigh, looking very troubled. {w}{w=0.5}
火铜？据说{color=#d0380a}沃焦山{/color}内盛产火铜，但那地方焦金流石，怎么可能有植物生长，道友莫不是在消遣在下？¤Fire copper? It is said that {color=#d0380a} Inferno Mountain {/color} is rich in fire copper, but how can there be plants growing in the burnt gold flowing stones in that place? Is it possible that fellow Taoists are entertaining?
不知这宁州古迹中何等凶险，若有突发情况还望{FirstName}长老多多护佑同门。¤I don't know how dangerous this Ning Province historic site is. If there is an emergency, I hope the elder {FirstName} will protect the same door.
据掌门所言，这宁州古迹中有一处传承火属性绝学之地，我定要前往得之！¤According to the head, there is a place where fire attributes are inherited in this ancient site in Ning Province, and I will definitely go there to get it!
掌门曾嘱托我在古迹中寻找些六品的火属性矿石，{FirstName}道友若能帮忙留意一些，我定厚礼相谢。¤The headmaster once asked me to look for some sixth-grade fire-attribute ores in the historic sites. If fellow {FirstName} can help pay attention to some, I will give a generous gift.
很不错。¤very nice.
暂未开放。¤Not yet open.
你盘膝静坐，五心朝天，闭目凝神，意守丹田，试图调动内外灵气，寻觅一丝突破的感觉，但可惜修为未至巅峰，只得作罢。¤You sit with your knees crossed, your five hearts facing the sky, your eyes closed and your mind on your dantian, trying to mobilise your internal and external spiritual energy to find a hint of a breakthrough, but unfortunately your cultivation has not yet reached its peak and you have to give up.
你盘膝静坐，慢慢凝聚挤压着灵气，进入了空灵的状态。周身的灵气蠢蠢欲动，突然之间便汹涌澎湃起来，你不断地压缩着涌入丹田内的灵气...良机易逝，你深知必须尽快凝液成丹。¤You sit cross-legged in meditation, slowly gathering and squeezing your aura, entering an ethereal state. The aura around you stirs and suddenly surges, and you keep compressing the aura that is pouring into your dantian... The opportunity is fleeting, and you know that you must condense the liquid into a dan as soon as possible.
你盘膝静坐，经脉与元婴中灵气的运转协调共振，进入空灵的状态。周身的灵气瞬时一凝，刹那间便如排山倒海般汹涌澎湃起来，你冷静地牵引着天地灵气...良机易逝，你深知必须尽快脱凡化神。¤You sit cross-legged in meditation, your meridians resonating in harmony with the movement of the spiritual energy in your Nascent Soul, entering a state of emptiness. The aura around you instantly condenses, and in an instant it surges like a mountain overturning the sea. The opportunity is fleeting, and you know that you must quickly enter Deity Transformation.
你盘膝静坐，将精气神凝于金丹之上，进入空灵的状态。周身的灵气愈动愈缓，似乎正酝酿着什么，刹那之间便汹涌澎湃起来，你不断地吞噬着天地灵气...良机易逝，你深知必须尽快碎丹结婴。¤You sit cross-legged in silence, concentrating your essence on the Golden Core and entering a state of emptiness. The aura around you moves more and more slowly, as if something is brewing, and in an instant it surges up, as you continue to devour the aura of heaven and earth... You are aware of the need to break your pellet and form a baby as soon as possible.
每次境界突破都伴随着巨大的风险，已经做好万全的准备要开始突破了么...？¤Every realm breakthrough is accompanied by huge risks. Are you ready to start breaking through...?
你盘膝静坐，耐心地搬运灵气，运转周天，逐渐进入了空灵的状态。周身的灵气慢慢激奋起来，疯狂地向丹田涌入，你不断压缩着丹田内的灵气...良机易逝，你深知必须尽快完成筑基。¤You sit cross-legged in meditation, patiently carrying your aura and running the circumference, gradually entering a state of emptiness. The aura around you slowly stirs up and frantically pours into your dantian, and you keep compressing the aura in your dantian... You are aware that you must complete your foundation building as soon as possible.
不过我听说{color=#d0380a}碎星商会{/color}好像也搜集过相关的消息，你如果有兴趣，可以去询问一下。¤However, I heard {color=#d0380a}The Shattered Star Merchant Guild {/color} seems to have collected related news, if you are interested, you can go ask about it.
道友难道是第一次来这片海域？图南漩涡可以说是无尽之海最危险的异象之一了。¤Is this the first time you have come to this sea? The South Tu Whirlpool is arguably one of the most dangerous visions of the Endless Sea.
图南漩涡的位置？我也没见过...毕竟见过的修士都死了。¤The location of the South Tu Whirlpool? I've never seen it either... After all, the cultivators who have seen it are dead.
哦？大漩涡？¤Oh? Maelstrom?
我知道的消息，都已经告诉道友了。¤All the information I know has already been told to you.
竟是如此凶险！看来我若要在海上探索还是避开着点比较好。道友可知这...什么漩涡的大致位置？¤It's so dangerous! It seems that if I want to explore the sea, it is better to avoid the point. Do you know the general location of this... What is the general location of the vortex?
那个大漩涡最近好像又出现了，在图南海航行时最好小心点。¤That maelstrom seems to have reappeared recently, so you better be careful when sailing in the Tu Nanhai.
多谢道友相告。¤Thank you for telling us.
不过漩涡的具体位置我也不太清楚，只是听说遇到图南漩涡还能生还的修士百里无一，甚至听说曾有化神修士仗着修为强闯漩涡，但也未能脱离，就此失去音讯。¤But the specific location of the vortex I'm not too sure, but I heard that the encounter with the South Tu Whirlpool can still survive a hundred miles of cultivators, and even heard that there have been Deity Transformation rely on the cultivation of the vortex, but also failed to break away, this lost.
你与炎萧又见到一人正以手中魔晶吸取周围的魔气。¤You and Yan Xiao saw another person who was sucking up the surrounding magic qi with the magic crystal in his hand.
而那魔修就没这么从容了。一边是自己面对一个金丹修士还久攻不下，另一边是炎萧对战一个元婴初期和数个金丹后期如入无人之境，两相影响之下这元婴后期魔修出手看似是越来越狠厉，但每每被你防下心中更是越来越焦急。¤And that evil cultivator is not so relaxed. On the one hand, they face a jindan cultivator also long attack, the other side is Yan Xiao against a YuanYing early stage and several jindan late stage as into no man's land, under the influence of the two phases this YuanYing late evil cultivator strikes seem to be more and more ruthless, but every time you defend the heart is more and more anxious.
呦？送上门的肉参。¤Yo? The meat ginseng sent to the door.
看起来不像普通的石头，但又感受不到一丝灵力的波动，这种情况倒是少见。¤It doesn't look like an ordinary stone, but it doesn't feel any fluctuations in spiritual power, which is rare.
没准还有什么特别的研究价值，拿去给采筠阁那些修士鉴定一番好了...¤Maybe there is any special research value, let's use it to identify the cultivators in Caiyun Pavilion...
这是...?¤This is...?
没准还有什么特别的研究价值，先拿着罢...¤Maybe there is any special research value, take it first...
先四处转转，看看有什么可疑的地方吧...¤Let's take a look around and see what's suspicious...
囊中羞涩...哎，我还是靠走的吧。¤Pocket is ashamed...hey, I'll just rely on walking.
我拿到这情报就可以前往一个秘境了是吗？¤If I get this information, I can go to a secret realm, right?
这位道友，要来一份我天机阁的情报玉简吗？¤This fellow Taoist, would you like a copy of my secret jade slip from the Heavenly Secret Pavilion?
我天机阁修士行走天下，各地秘境开启的灵气波动自然也多有记录。¤My Heavens Secrets Pavilion cultivator walks around the world, naturally, there are many records of the aura fluctuations opened in secret realms in various places.
确实，不过秘境开启时间有限还望道友得到情报后速速前往。¤Indeed, but the time for opening the secret realm is limited. I hope that fellow Daoist will go quickly after getting the information.
嗯，有点长进¤Well, a little bit of progress
你这么不经打，以后怎么让我放心把事情交给你去办？¤How can you let me rest assured to leave things to you in the future?
你眼前是一片破败的灵药田，所幸有一颗{SayStcVal=948}孤零零的立于药田之中。¤Before you is a dilapidated field of Pills, fortunately there is a {SayStcVal=948} standing alone in the middle of the field.
你眼前是一片废墟，依稀可以看出这里曾经是一片药田。¤Before you is a ruin, you can vaguely see that this was once a medicine field.
不错，也还是有所收获。¤Not bad, and still rewarding.
神秘声音：念你修为不易，且饶你一命。下次可就没这么简单了。¤Mysterious voice: remember your cultivation is not easy, and spare your life. Next time it will not be so easy.
尽管你非常在意，但是那声音并没有再响起。¤Despite your great concern, that voice did not ring out again.
只见那使用火灵气的修士灵活地避过一道金刃，四周的火灵气似浪涛般向其右掌奔涌而去。那修士掌中霎时红光大盛，由火灵气组成的巨型手掌似凝实的火焰般朝对手攻去。¤The fire aura practitioner nimbly dodged a golden blade, and the fire aura around him rushed towards his right palm like a wave. The cultivator's palm suddenly glowed red, and a giant palm made of fire aura attacked his opponent like a solid flame.
经过方才的观战，你对此人的实力已有所了解。盘算一番后，你决定趁对方灵力较弱时将他斩于马下。¤After just watching the battle, you already know the strength of this person. After some calculations, you decide to cut him off the horse when the opponent's spiritual power is weak.
看来那两人已经发现了你的存在，只是一时抽不出时间对付你，你准备...¤It seems that those two people have already discovered your existence, but they just can't spare time to deal with you for a while, you are ready to...
而使用金灵气的修士也不落其下，道道金光击打在另一方的灵气护罩上，激起层层猛烈的灵气波动，那护罩几息之间便碎裂开来。¤And the cultivator who used the golden aura did not fall behind. The golden light hit the aura shield on the other side, arousing violent aura fluctuations, and the shield shattered in a few breaths.
习得：烈火掌¤Acquisition: Palm of Fire
与其被动等待倒不如主动出击，想到这一点，你冲出丛林向对方发起进攻。¤Rather than waiting passively, it is better to take the initiative. Thinking of this, you rush out of the jungle to attack the opponent.
这攻击同时给你的金之道带来了无尽的启迪，你在其中似乎摸到了些许对抗灵气护罩的独到方式。你屏息牢记这一神通，打算之后再细细研习。¤This attack has also brought endless enlightenment to your Golden Way. It seems that you have touched some unique ways to fight against the aura shield. You hold your breath in mind this magical power, and plan to study it later.
你盯着那手掌，其中暴戾的灵气似是受了什么制约才凝成这般形状。你本就对火之道有所苦修，如今这神通更是令你对其的领悟更深一层。¤You stare at the palm of your hand, and the violent aura in it seems to have been constrained to form this shape. You already have a penance for the way of fire, and now this magical power makes you even more deeply aware of it. .
你心中一喜，急忙拨开植物向前探查，此时两股强劲的神识向你袭来。¤With a joy in your heart, you hurriedly pushed aside the plant and explored it. At this time, two powerful psychic consciousnesses are coming to you.
不消多时那火系修士便落于下风，殒命于几道乱刃下。取胜的金系修士此时已开始落座调息，你要...¤It didn't take long for the fire-type cultivator to fall into the wind, and was killed by a few chaotic blades. The winning gold-type cultivator has already begun to sit down and adjust his breath, you have to...
你踏上这片岛屿后便听到远处传来激烈的打斗声，询声望去灿金与赤红灵气战成一片，煞是灿烂。想来是道法高深的金系修士与火系修士于此开战，你决定...¤After you set foot on this island, you hear fierce fighting sounds from a distance. Inquire about your reputation and go to the golden and scarlet auras to fight together. It is really brilliant. I want to come to be a cultivator of the gold system and the cultivator of the fire system. At this war, you decide...
两人相战正酣，只当是岛上灵兽拨弄树丛发出了声响，并没太过放在心上。¤The two are fighting vigorously, only when the spirit beast on the island makes a noise with the bushes, and it doesn't take it too seriously.
你放低身形，尽可能小心地向着打斗的方向前进。穿过层层树丛后你隐约见到前方闪烁的剑光，这片植物后大概就是二人的交战地。¤You lower your body and move forward as carefully as possible in the direction of the fight. After passing through the layers of trees, you can vaguely see the sword light flashing in front. This plant is probably the place where the two of you are fighting.
只见那使用火灵气的修士挥手便是一道熊熊烈焰组成的手掌向对方袭去，这攻击来势汹汹，迅猛万分。你虽不晓得其中门道，却也不禁暗叹一声好掌法！¤I saw that the cultivator using the fire spirit waved his hand as a palm composed of raging flames attacking the opponent. This attack was fierce and swift. Although you don't know the way, you can't help but sigh a good palm!
习得：千钧斩¤Acquisition: Qianjun Slash
而使用金灵气的修士不知用了什么神通生生抗住了烈火掌的攻击，闪身便是几道凌厉的金光击打在对方的灵气护罩上。原本结实牢靠的护罩在接连的攻击下泛起猛烈的灵气波动，几息之间便化作点点灵光消散在空气中。¤And the cultivator who used the golden aura did not know what magical power he used to resist the attack of the palm of the fire, and when he flashed, a few fierce golden lights hit the opponent's aura shield. The original strong and reliable shield was under successive attacks. Violent aura fluctuations appeared, and within a few breaths, it turned into a little bit of aura and dissipated in the air.
你感受到两股神识无情地碾过你的识海，幸好你修为强盛，这两人的神识并未对你造成什么影响。¤You feel that two strands of divine consciousness run over your sea of ​​consciousness mercilessly. Fortunately, your cultivation base is strong, and the divine consciousness of these two people has not had any effect on you.
你趁对方还没发现你，迅速催动遁术离开了此地。¤You took advantage of the fact that the other party hadn't found you, and quickly urged Escape to leave here.
不消多时那火系修士便落于下风，殒命于几道乱刃下。取胜的金系修士此时已开始寻找你的踪迹，你要...¤It didn't take long for the fire cultivator to fall into the wind, and was killed by a few chaotic blades. The winning gold cultivator has already begun to look for your trace at this time, you have to...
你对他们的威胁不以为意，依旧藏身丛林中窥探着他们的斗法。¤You don't care about their threats, you still hide in the jungle to spy on their fighting methods.
你感受到两股不弱的神识波动扫遍四周，所幸你的神识要高于这二人，他们并没有发现你的存在。¤You feel two waves of not weak divine consciousness sweeping around, but fortunately your divine consciousness is higher than these two, they didn't notice your existence.
你感受到两股强大的神识碾过你的识海，一瞬间猛烈的剧痛侵占了你的意识，你眼前一黑，晕了过去。¤You feel two powerful divine consciousness run over your sea of ​​consciousness, and for a moment a violent pain invades your consciousness, your eyes go dark and you fainted.
我派道诣不在炼丹，{shidi}若有需要，可以自行使用炼丹房。¤I don't send Taobao to refining alchemy. If necessary, {shidi} can use the alchemy room by himself.
随着血煞老怪的倒地，余下的禾山道众登时风流云散，一时间人影躁动，一片混乱。¤As the old monster blood fell to the ground, the rest of the Heshan Daoists suddenly disappeared, and the figures were restless for a while, and they were in chaos.
想必禾山道自此便会在宁州除名，也算功德一件。¤Presumably Heshan Dao will be removed from Ning Province from then on, which is considered a merit.
您请稍后，我这就将事宜安排下去。¤Please wait a moment, and I will arrange the matter.
是来镇守执事堂的长老大人？¤Is it the elder who came to guard the deacon's hall?
看来是我的错觉。¤It seems to be my illusion.
何人？此地是我{SayStcVal=928}的地域，阁下是迷路了？¤Who? This place is my {SayStcVal=928} area, you are lost?
几年间，你谨慎的在此地镇守，神识不断扫过，但并没有什么异常。¤For several years, you have guarded here carefully, and your divine consciousness has been constantly swept, but there is nothing unusual.
你屏息凝神，细细查探并没有什么发现。¤You hold your breath, look closely and find nothing.
几年间，你谨慎地在此地址值守，不断有门内弟子经过执事堂，在外恭敬作揖后离开。¤For several years, you discreetly guarded this location, and constantly had disciples of the sect pass by the Deacon Hall and leave after bowing respectfully outside.
此番值守还真是风平浪静。¤This time on duty is really calm.
我已完成掌门交代的事宜。¤I have completed the matters explained by the head.
你们{SayStcVal=928}守着这等宝地，我不过是借点东西一用。¤You {SayStcVal=928} are guarding this precious place. I just borrowed something to use it.
哼，大胆孽畜。\n¤Hmph, bold wicked animal.\n
你谨慎的在此地镇守，神识不断扫过，突然间一股妖气出现似乎在袭击本门弟子。¤You are guarding this place cautiously, your divine consciousness is constantly sweeping by, and suddenly a monster aura appears to be attacking the disciple.
哼，看招！！¤Huh, look at the trick!!
你谨慎的在此地镇守，神识不断扫过，似乎有一道隐晦的气息在旁潜伏。¤You are guarding here cautiously, your divine consciousness keeps sweeping, and there seems to be a vague aura lurking nearby.
鹤真人死后，你的阴阳瞳捕捉到一道奇异的光从他的妖丹出飞。¤After the death of the crane real, your yin and yang pupil catches a strange light flying out of his demon dan.
你循着光追了过去，不一会便找到了海底的一处迷阵。¤You followed the light and chased it, and in a short while you found a maze at the bottom of the sea.
你清晰地感应到天地意志对你力量的排斥，来自天劫的强大地压迫感开始笼罩着你。¤You clearly sense the rejection of your power by the will of heaven and earth, and a powerful sense of oppression from the heavenly tribulation begins to overwhelm you.
你回想突破时神魂出窍时感受到的力量，只有那种力量才能与天劫相抗衡...¤Think back to the power you felt when your soul emerged from the body at the breakthrough... Only that kind of power can compete with the heavenly tribulation...
这便是天劫的威能么...用寻常的神通法门绝不可能抵挡...这是更高层次，凌驾于这一方天地之上的力量。¤Is this the power of the heavenly tribulation... It would be impossible to resist it with ordinary magical techniques... This is a higher level of power, above the heaven and earth.
你屏气凝神，神魂再一次自天灵脱壳而出，融于周身天地之间...¤You hold your breath and concentrate, and your soul once again comes out of its shell from the heavenly spirit and melts between the surrounding heaven and earth...
这东西似乎是上古龙族的布阵之物。¤This thing seems to be the formation of the ancient dragon clan.
我们问道楼出售的可都是最实用的神通法门，道友看看便知。¤We asked Daolou to sell the most practical magic methods. Daoists will find out if they look at it.
道友说笑了，您现在的修为那还需要我给您推荐什么功法。¤Friends joked, your current cultivation base still needs me to recommend any exercises to you.
要说这修仙入门，无非是外练肉身，内练经脉。我看道友如今方才炼气期，正是为炼体和炼气打下基础的好时机。¤To say that this introduction to cultivating immortality is nothing more than practicing the physical body externally and practicing the meridians internally. I think Taoists are only now in the Qi refining period, and it is a good time to lay the foundation for refining body and Qi.
哈哈哈，道友真是有眼光。¤Hahaha, fellow Taoists really have a vision.
我们问道楼就有两本极好的入门功法，一本唤作《凌云诀》，乃上佳的炼气功法。另一本唤作《玉云功》，用来炼体就再合适不过了。每本只要225灵石，道友可要选上一本？¤We asked Dao Lou to have two excellent introductory exercises. One is called Ling Yun Jue, which is the best qigong method. The other is called Yu Yun Gong, which can be used for body training. It's perfect. Each book only needs 225 spirit stones, should fellow Taoists choose one?
修真之人岂能把此物看得过重？¤How can a person of cultivation take this thing too seriously?
道友赤子心性，只是对外宣扬的噱头罢了。盈手露的原料也非什么稀罕物，只是云汐城遍地都有的桃李花而已。¤Friends of Daoist nature are just a gimmick for publicity. The raw materials used to show the hands are not rare, but the peach and plum blossoms everywhere in Yunxi City.
算了，多一事不如少一事。¤Forget it, one thing is worse than one thing less.
“这是......？”¤this is......?
这两个可不是同一种阵法，你这{xiaozi}修行还不到家啊。¤These two are not the same formation, you {xiaozi} haven't practiced at home yet.
如道友所见，敝府凭一技之长扬名云汐。若有阵法方面的需求，大可向我公孙府寻求帮助。¤As the dao friends saw, our mansion became famous for its skill. If there is a need for formation, you can ask my Gongsun Mansion for help.
听了你的回答，公孙季沉默不语，像是在思索着什么。你猜不透他的意图，手指在白玉案上轻轻地摩挲着，一股似曾相识的波动从案上传来。¤After hearing your answer, Gongsun Ji was silent, as if thinking about something. You can't guess his intentions, rubbing his fingers gently on the Baiyu case, a wave of deja vu from the case.
“之前在听雨阁喝茶时也传来了相同的波动，难道公孙府和听雨阁也有关联？”¤The same fluctuations were heard when I was drinking tea in Tingyu Pavilion before. Is there a connection between Gongsun Mansion and Tingyu Pavilion?
阁下说得不无道理，如果有人出灵石向你买一位无辜稚童的命呢？¤Your Excellency is not unreasonable. What if someone buys you the life of an innocent child from a spiritual stone?
你虽疑惑，却还是按着他的指引踏上前往花厅的路。¤Although you are puzzled, you still follow his guidance on the road to the Flower Hall.
你察觉到了？¤You noticed it?
看来道友已经试过其他的路了？公孙府没有什么其他本事，只是擅长自保而已。¤It seems that Fellow Daoist has tried other ways? Gongsun Mansion has no other skills, just good at self-protection.
方才拍卖会上我观道友出手阔绰，不知道友对于灵石有何感想？¤At the auction just now, I watched the Taoist friends lavishly, I don't know what your friends feel about the spirit stone?
哈哈哈，道友当真有趣。若是你发现这孩童其实怪病缠身命不久矣，死了反而解脱，你又当如何？¤Hahaha, fellow Daoist is really interesting. If you find out that this child is actually sick and ridden for a long time, and died but is relieved, what shall you do?
同魏无极闲聊间你走到花厅，绚烂的桃花梨花绽满枝梢，公孙季便坐在花下的白玉案边。¤While chatting with Wei Wuji, you walk to the Flower Hall, the splendid peach blossoms are full of branches, and Gongsun Ji sits beside the white jade table under the flowers.
哈哈，叫道友莫拍只是因为那坛盈手露并非佳酿，这壶中的才是上品。¤Haha, I called Daoyou Mo Pai just because that jar of Yingshou Lu is not a good wine, and the one in this pot is the top grade.
{FirstName}{LastName}前来拜会，叨扰了。¤{FirstName}{LastName} came to pay a visit, and I was disturbed.
嗯...这个感觉，和那个地方一样。¤Um...this feels the same as that place.
无端杀戮确实不妥，只是要看报酬值不值我这样做了。¤Unprovoked killing is really wrong, it just depends on whether the reward is worth what I did.
道友，你我他日再聚。¤Friends of Taoism, you and I will meet again later.
不远处就是岔路口，想起小厮的话，你鬼使神差地走向另一条路。腿还没迈进去，一股柔和的力量将你推回原地。¤Not far away is a fork in the road. Thinking of Xiao Si's words, you walked to another road in a ghostly manner. Before your legs stepped in, a gentle force pushed you back where you were.
正是，你一路走来见不到府中其他人怕也是阵法使然。¤Exactly, the fact that you didn't see other people in the mansion along the way was probably due to the formation.
冷酷无情、天理难容、丧尽天良！¤Cold and ruthless, incompetent, and desolate!
他又一次递给你一张纸条，并嘱咐你出府后再打开。你二人共饮了一阵，把一坛盈手露喝个精光才惜惜拜别。¤He hands you a note again, and asks you to open it after you leave the house. You two drank together for a while, drunk a lot of hands and drank it before you say goodbye.
不是说材料珍贵，供应极少......？¤It's not that the materials are precious and the supply is minimal...?
道友请坐，想必你有很多疑问吧？¤Friends, please sit down, you must have a lot of questions, right?
{FirstName}道友果非池中物，公孙某没看错人。¤{FirstName} Taoist friend is not a thing in the pool, Gongsun did not misunderstand the person.
公孙季意味深长地笑了笑。¤Gongsun Ji smiled meaningfully.
既然{FirstName}道友没有问题了，接下来便换我问问道友。¤Since Daoist {FirstName} has no questions, then I will ask Daoist for me.
阵法？¤Formation?
犹豫时公孙季已经停下思考笑着望向你，你二人又共饮了一阵，把一坛盈手露喝个精光才惜惜拜别。¤When he hesitated, Gongsun Ji had already stopped thinking and looked at you with a smile. You two drank again for a while, and then he said goodbye after drinking a lot of hands.
难怪刚刚的家丁有恃无恐，这府中原来布满了阵法。¤It's no wonder that the family just now has no fear, this mansion was originally full of formations.
你二人又共饮了一阵，把一坛盈手露喝个精光才惜惜拜别。¤You two drank again for a while, and then drank a full pot of hands and drank it before saying goodbye.
公孙季但笑不语，只是嘱托你出府后还是少去听雨阁为妙。¤Gongsunji didn't laugh, but he asked you to go to the Yuge less after leaving the house.
不知什么原因，公孙府内走动的人极少，要说人丁单薄的话下人也总该有那么几个，可除了门口的小厮外你竟再也没见过其他人。¤For some reason, there are very few people walking around in Gongsun's Mansion. If the people are mediocre, there should always be so many servants, but you have never seen anyone except the small servant at the door.
太多资源都需要灵石换取，离开灵石实在是仙途坎坷。¤Too many resources need spirit stones in exchange. Leaving the spirit stones is really a bumpy journey.
碎星岛上的商队偶尔会来到宁州进行交易，我也是跟着他们来这里开开眼界。¤The caravans on Broken Star Island occasionally come to Ning Province to trade, and I also followed them to open my eyes here.
你们四人也将各得到门派赏赐的筑基丹一枚。¤The four of you will also each receive a Foundation Pill as a reward from the sect.
哈哈哈...慕容师姐谬赞了，我看你们门派的白露师妹也是身手不凡。¤Hahaha...Senior Sister Murong is absurdly praised, I think the Sister Bailu of your school is also very skilled.
（低声）哼...虚伪的男人，瞧你刚刚那得意的样子。¤(Whispering) Humph... hypocritical man, look at how proud you were just now.
现在让我来看看你的大道吧！¤Now let me take a look at your avenue!
（尴尬）咳咳咳咳....¤(Embarrassed) Cough cough cough cough...
诸位道友，本次宗门大比已决出了前四位弟子，他们都是我们两派年轻一辈中的精英，肩负着我们两派的未来。¤Dear fellow daoists, the first four disciples have been decided in this Zongmen Grand Competition. They are all the elites of the younger generation of our two factions, and they shoulder the future of our two factions.
那个...诸位道友，本次宗门大比已决出了前四位弟子，他们都是我们两派年轻一辈中的精英，肩负着我们两派的未来。¤Well... fellow daoists, the first four disciples have been decided in this Zongmen Grand Competition. They are all the elites of the younger generation of our two factions, and they shoulder the future of our two factions.
好了，接下来你们将进行最后的两轮比试，只有最终夺魁者才能够直接晋升为内门弟子，祝你们好运。¤Well, you will have the last two rounds of competition next. Only the winner can be directly promoted to the inner disciple. Good luck.
（开心）小{shidi}今天看起来状态不错。¤(Happy) Little {shidi} looks good today.
{FirstName}{shidi}，这是我最后一次参加大比的机会了，我不会留手的，¤{FirstName}{shidi}, this is my last chance to participate in the competition, I will not keep it,
徐师兄，请！¤Brother Xu, please!
呵呵，萧师弟，贵派可真是人才辈出呢。¤Haha, Junior Brother Xiao, the noble school is really talented.
请{FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}和徐凡师弟上台！¤Please {FirstName}{LastName}{shidi} and Junior Brother Xu Fan on stage!
多谢{FirstName}{shidi}上次的点拨，我已明白属于自己的道是什么。¤Thank you {FirstName}{shidi} for the last call, I already understand what my Tao is.
前段时间在九嶷山炼魂，有个臭散修仗着自己遁速快，三番五次挑衅于我，每次我都只看到一道金色的遁光，他就从我眼皮子底下给溜了。¤Some time ago, I was refining souls in Jiuyi Mountain. There was an annoying independent cultivator who relied on his own speed to escape and provoked me again and again. Every time I only saw a golden light, he slipped under my nose. .
这五柳根是三品的珍贵药材，它形似普通的枯树枝，但外壳很硬，难以采集。¤The Petrificious Root is a precious third grade herb. It look like ordinary dead roots, but the shell is very hard and difficult to gather.
九叶芝？¤Nine Forked Shroom?
{xiaozi}，你有没有听说过一种名叫“九叶芝”的草药？¤{xiaozi}, have you ever heard of a herb called the Nine Forked Shroom?
你最近表现的不错，我暂时也没有什么事情要交给你去办了，回去好好修炼吧。¤You have performed well recently. I don't have anything to leave to you for the time being. Go back and practice hard.
你得替我想办法去教训一下他，出了我这口恶气！¤You have to think of a way for me to teach him, it's out of my breath!
不错不错，你这次也算帮了我一个大忙了。说吧，你想要什么赏赐？¤Not bad, you did a great favor this time. Come on, what reward do you want?
不应该没有效果啊... ...¤It shouldn't be ineffective...
桀桀桀桀，这沂山双鬼倒是耐得住性子。你这次干得不错，我果然没有看错人。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie, these two ghosts of Yishan can stand your temper. You did a good job this time, and I didn't see the wrong person.
听说沂山的青面鬼和赤发鬼许久不露面了，桀桀桀桀，你去沂山附近随便收拾他们几个弟子，探探他们的虚实。¤I heard that the green-faced ghosts and red-haired ghosts in Yishan haven't shown up for a long time. Jiejie Jiejie, you can pick up a few of their disciples around Yishan and explore their reality.
好，以后传音符联系！¤OK, contact by voice transmission later!
这不会有危险吧？¤This is not dangerous, is it?
也因为这样，我之前只能用药性相似的“补天芝”来炼制，现在看来还是不成。¤Because of this, I could only refine it using Skymend Shrooms which has similar medicinal properties, but looks like it is still not enough.
听说那青面鬼和赤发鬼死在了自家山头，也不知道是哪位大能出的手。¤I heard that the green-faced ghost and the red-haired ghost died on the top of their mountain, and I don't know who can do it.
嗯，那这500灵石你便收下吧。¤Well, then you can accept these 500 spirit stones.
什么感觉？¤How does it feel?
那沂山派的赤发鬼和青面鬼夺了本来属于我们禾山道的宝贝，我们自然不会就这么算了。¤The red-haired ghosts and blue-faced ghosts of the Yishan Sect have robbed the treasures that originally belonged to our Heshan Dao, so naturally we won't just let it go.
桀桀桀桀，没错，我要的就是这个，你这次干的不错。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie, yes, this is what I want. You did a good job this time.
东西呢？你莫不是在拿我寻开心？¤What about things? Are you making fun of me?
听说这是一件从秘境里带出来的法宝，也不知是多少年前的东西了。那赤发鬼与青面鬼逃回去后就一直躲在{color=#d0380a}沂山{/color}不出来，好像就是在闭关研究那件法宝。¤I heard that this is a magic weapon brought out of the secret realm. I don’t know how old it is. The red-haired ghost and the green-faced ghost have been hiding in {color=#d0380a}Yishan{/color }If you don’t come out, it seems to be studying the magic weapon in retreat.
这件事也算得上极其危险，不过你要是能帮我办成，我一定少不了你的好处。¤This matter can be considered extremely dangerous, but if you can help me do it, I will definitely benefit from you.
怎么样...有什么感觉么？¤How... do you feel?
事情办得怎么样了？{w}{w=0.5}¤How are things going? {w}{w=0.5}
那我便赐你三颗洗髓丹，助你精进修为。¤Then I will give you three Minor Qi Pills to help you improve your cultivation.
嗯...真香！¤Um... it smells so good!
不该你知道的东西少打听。¤Inquire less about things you shouldn't know.
什么浑身舒畅，这丹药哪有你说的那么神奇？再说了，我又没中毒，吃这解毒的药丸能有啥效果。¤What kind of comfort? How can this pill be as magical as you said? Besides, I am not poisoned. What effect can I take this detoxification pill?
上次炼的清蕴丹也不知道成色怎么样，桀桀桀桀，正好你来帮我试服一颗，看看效果。¤I wonder how is the quality of the Panacea Pill I made last time, Kekeke, you can help me test out its strength.
这锁魂幡与我们禾山道的功法相辅相成，威力无穷，你若能好好利用，与人战斗时一定大有益处。¤This soul-locking flag is complementary to our Heshan Dao technique, and it is infinitely powerful. If you can make good use of it, it will be of great benefit when fighting people.
不过，如今宁州只有在方壶山和连石山一带，才能找到这味药材了，但这两片区域被竹山宗与金虹剑派所掌管着，普通人是不让进山采集的。¤However, nowadays Ning Province can only find this medicinal material in the areas of Square Cauldron Mountain and Lianshi Mountain, but these two areas are controlled by the Bamboo Mountain School and the Golden Rainbow Sword School, and ordinary people are not allowed to enter the mountains to collect them.
此灵芝青盖长茎，有九片叶子，所以叫做九叶芝。它和我之前让你找的五柳根一样，都是三品的草药，非常稀有。¤This Spirit Ganoderma has a long stem and nine leaves, so it is called the Nine Forked Shroom. It is also a rare third grade herb like the Petrificious Root I had asked you to find earlier.
桀桀桀桀，放心吧，这清蕴丹是解毒灵丹，就算吃了没效果，也毒不死你。¤Kekeke, don't worry, this Panacea Pill is a detoxification pill, even if you eat it, it should not kill you.
事情办得怎么样了？¤How are things going?
就是...你有没有觉得自己浑身舒畅，灵力充沛？¤That's...Do you feel that you are comfortable and full of spiritual energy?
嗝~¤Hiccup~
你从麻老九手中接过一粒丹药，小心翼翼的放入口中，然后仰头吞了下去。¤You took a pill from Ma Laojiu, carefully put it in your mouth, and swallowed it with your head up.
不过这味草药虽然稀有，却恰好也出产于在禾山一带，所以花一点时间，应该就能找到。¤However, although this herb is rare, it happens to be produced in the Heshan area, so you should be able to find it after a little time.
听说这两人逃回去后就一直躲在{color=#d0380a}沂山{/color}不出来，好像在闭关研究那件法宝。¤I heard that these two people have been hiding in {color=#d0380a}Yishan{/color} after they fled back. They seem to be studying the magic weapon in retreat.
麻老九突然深深地看了你一眼。¤Ma Laojiu suddenly took a deep look at you.
此事与你说说倒也无妨，想必你之前也已经听说过一些了。¤It's okay to tell you about this. I think you've heard of it before.
这...这果真是九叶芝，哈哈哈哈。¤This...this is really the Nine Fork Shroom, hahahaha.
麻老九深深地看了你一眼。¤Ma Laojiu took a deep look at you.
明白了，交给我吧。¤Understood, leave it to me.
你从麻老九手中接过一粒丹药，直接丢进嘴里，吧唧吧唧地嚼了起来，一股浓烈的药香味在你嘴中弥漫。¤You took a pill of medicine from Ma Laojiu and threw it directly into your mouth, chewed it up, a strong smell of medicine filled your mouth.
我这几天正好在研究一个老丹方，现在就缺了一味叫做五柳根的草药，你去帮我采一株来。¤I happened to be studying an old Pill recipe for the past few days, and now I am just missing a Petrificious Root. Go and find one for me.
桀桀桀桀，区区一个散修也敢惹我们禾山道的人，这就是下场。¤Muhahaha, a mere independent cultivator who dares to provoke us Heshan Dao, this is what you get.
一股强劲的灵力袭来，将栖云长老击退。¤A strong spiritual force struck, and drove Elder Qiyun back.
林沐心转过头朝你做了个鬼脸，挥了下手示意你跟上去。¤Lin Muxin turned her head and made a grimace at you, and waved her hand to beckon you to follow.
冲虚长老面色铁青，但见此情此景也只能讪讪一笑，向丹阳子作揖后便灰头土脸地离开了。¤Elder Chongxu's complexion was ashen, but when he saw this, he could only chuck around, and left with shame after talking to Danyangzi.
心儿，长老会内部还要处理些事情，你先带这位小友回房休息吧。¤Xin'er, there are still some things to be dealt with within the Presbyterian Church. You can take this little friend back to your room to rest first.
方才还不可一世的栖云长老此刻已噤若寒蝉，想来这位突然出手的神秘人便是当代林家家主丹阳子了。¤The elder Qiyun, who was still so young, has been silent at this moment. The mysterious man who wanted to come out suddenly is Dan Yangzi, the contemporary Lin Family Patriarch.
{vpunch=10,0.5}家...家主！！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5} family... Patriarch!!!
丹阳子又扭头看向了你和林沐心的方向。¤Danyangzi turned his head and looked in the direction of you and Lin Muxin.
若不是通羽知会于我，我倒不知道你还有这么大的胆子，看来我当真太纵容你了！¤If Tong Yu hadn't told me, I don't know you still have such courage, it seems I really indulge you too!
冲虚长老，今日我们林家还有家事要处理，不便接客，回到星宫还请代我向各位长老问好。¤Elder Chongxu, today our Lin family still has family affairs to deal with. It is inconvenient to pick up guests. Please give me my regards to the elders when you return to the Star Palace.
这位小友倒是不简单，如此年纪就能抵挡住栖云的攻势。¤This little friend is not easy, he can resist Qiyun's offensive at such an age.
对小辈出手，像什么话！¤What is it like to shoot at juniors!
找死！！！¤court death!!!
哼~土鸡瓦狗...¤Huh~ the chicken dog...
古籍《本草纲目》或有记载，待我查看一下。¤There may be records in the ancient book Compendium of Materia Medica, waiting for me to check it.
老板，你可听说过与火铜伴生的草药？¤Boss, have you ever heard of the herbal medicine accompanying fire copper?
五百年前？！¤Five hundred years ago?!
{shidi}缘何大惊小怪，难道你寻这草药有要事？¤{shidi} why all the fuss, do you have something to look for in this herb?
师兄，你可听说过与火铜伴生的草药？¤Brother, have you heard of the herbal medicine accompanying fire copper?
偶然听说而已，师兄莫放心上。¤I just heard it accidentally, brother don't worry about it.
有是有，名唤{color=#d0380a}宁州香薷{/color}，因极其{color=#d0380a}畏寒{/color}，故生于火铜四周。但这种植物在五百年前就已经灭绝了。¤There is there, the name {color=#d0380a}Ning Province Elsholtzia{/color}, because extremely {color=#d0380a}afraid of cold{/color}, so born around the fire copper. But this plant became extinct five hundred years ago.
唉，好不容易探得音讯，却又不是什么好消息。暂且先去武陵城将此事告知李相书吧......¤Oh, I finally got the news, but it's not good news. Let's go to Wuling City to tell Li Xiangshu about the matter for the time being...
偶然听说而已，老板莫放心上。¤I just heard that by chance, the boss can't worry about it.
{gongzi}缘何大惊小怪，难道你寻这草药有要事？可惜宁州香薷已经灭绝，小店有心无力......¤Why is {gongzi} making a fuss? Is there something important for you to find this herbal medicine? It is a pity that Ning Province Xianglu has been extinct, and the small shop is powerless...
师姐，你可听说过与火铜伴生的草药？¤Sister, have you ever heard of the herbal medicine accompanying fire copper?
偶然听说而已，师姐莫放心上。¤I just heard that by accident, Senior Sister, don't worry about it.
此任务暂未开放¤This task is not yet open
前辈，请问来我离火门何事？¤Senior, May i ask what business you have with my Heavenly Fire Gate?
炎萧道友可在门内？玄道宗说他最近去过天魔眼核心区，我需要找他了解一番天魔眼内的情况。¤Daoist friend Yan Xiao can be in the door? Mystic Dao Zong said he had recently visited the core area of the Heavenly Demon Eye, I need to find him to understand something about the situation inside the Heavenly Demon Eye.
说完，这位离火门修士便是往宗门内快步离去。¤After saying that, this Heavenly Fire Gate cultivator was heading towards the sect and left quickly.
前辈如若不急可在离火门等炎萧{$YXChenHao}归来，若是事情重要也可以前往此片海域寻他。但此行凶险，还请前辈准备充分再自行前往。¤Seniors if not urgent can wait for Yan Xiao {$YXChenHao} return in the Heavenly Fire Gate, if things are important can also go to this piece of sea to find him. But this trip is dangerous, please prepare well before going on your own.
若是不出意外，炎萧{$YXChenHao}应当会在此片海域的东南角。¤If there is no accident, Yan Xiao {$YXChenHao} should be in the southeast corner of this sea.
十分抱歉，炎萧{$YXChenHao}目前不在宗门内，听门中长老说他从天魔眼归来后便是往无尽之海去了，目的地应该是雷鸣海域。¤I'm very sorry, Yan Xiao {$YXChenHao} is currently not in the sect, listen to the elders in the sect said that he returned from the Heavenly Demon Eye is headed to the Endless Sea, the destination should be the Thunder Sea.
前辈如若不急可在离火门等炎萧{$YXChenHao}归来，若是事情重要也可以前往此片海域寻他。¤Seniors if not in a hurry can wait for Yan Xiao {$YXChenHao} to return at the Heavenly Fire Gate, if things are important can also go to this sea to find him.
此事不能耽搁，我还是去海上寻他吧。¤This matter can not be delayed, I better go to the sea to find him.
不出盏茶功夫，之前离去的离火门修士便已是归来。¤In less than a cup of tea, the cultivators of the Heavenly Fire Gate who had left earlier had already returned.
请前辈稍等，待我询问门内长老一番。¤Please wait for a moment, I will ask the elders of the sect.
有。¤Have.
遥望仙途伊始，你终于回想起自己的本心。好在现在回头还来得及，于是你拜别宁王，重新踏上属于自己的修真之路。¤Looking at the beginning of the immortal journey, you finally remember your own mind. Fortunately, it is still too late to look back, so you worship King Bening and embark on your own path of cultivation again.
我刚刚已经在你体内埋下了一道剑气，如果遇到危险，你便以真气催动剑气，我感应到就前去救你。¤I have buried a sword aura in your body just now. If you are in danger, you will use the true aura to urge the sword aura, and I will go and save you when I sense it.
美姬在怀，美酒傍身，你大半辈子都在闭关苦修，从未享受过如此人间极乐，真想就这么一直放纵下去...¤Maggie is in her arms, with a good wine, you have been in retreat for most of your life, and you have never enjoyed such bliss in the world. I really want to indulge like this forever...
送走这位不速之客后，你一想到接下来的麻烦便无心赴约，索性便打道回府了...¤After sending off this uninvited guest, you didn't want to go to the appointment when you thought of the next trouble, so you just went home...
他掐指施了个法诀拍进你胸口，然后将一张卷轴递给你。¤He pinched his finger and applied a magic trick, patted it into your chest, and then handed you a scroll.
这天你与美妾相约黄昏后，取了好酒正欲前往后院时，突然被一柄长剑截住去路。¤This day, after you met with your beautiful concubine at dusk, when you were about to go to the backyard after taking a good drink, you were suddenly blocked by a long sword.
你漫步来到酒宴之外，想起上次享乐时的美妙滋味，再回想自己过往闭关苦修的情景，又有些犹豫起来...{w}{w=0.5}¤You wandered outside the banquet, remembering the wonderful taste of the last time you had fun, and then thinking about your past retreats, and you hesitate...{w}{w=0.5}
这...这是那日我在宴会上见过的美妾！？¤This...this is the beautiful concubine I saw at the banquet that day!?
画像上这个人你可认识？¤Do you know this person in the portrait?
（不错，不错...能自己及时醒悟，反倒是一件好事）¤(Yes, yes... It's a good thing to wake up in time)
替我办事或者现在就死。¤Do things for me or die now.
你在宴会之上一直享乐至深夜，这才醉醺醺地返回自己的住所。¤You have been enjoying the banquet until late at night, and then you return to your residence drunkly.
不错，以你的身份，想在这王府内监视此人并不是什么难事。¤Yes, in your capacity, it is not difficult to monitor this person in this palace.
......道友真会说笑，既然允诺了报酬，在下倒是愿意听听，你到底想我监视何人。¤... Fellow Daoists can really laugh. Since I have promised to pay, I am willing to listen, who do you want me to monitor?
宁王府内，夜夜笙歌，食美酒取之不尽，银钱宝物用之不竭，宁王的美妾更是各个貌若天仙。¤In Ning King's Mansion, there are singing and singing every night, food and wine are inexhaustible, money and treasures are inexhaustible, and Ning King's beautiful concubines are all look like gods.
不知道友深夜来访有何贵干？¤I don't know what it's so expensive for your friend to visit late at night?
轻举妄动小心你项上人头不保。¤Be cautious of your risk of losing your head if you act rashly.
想到这里，你哈哈一笑，踱步走进酒宴。¤Thinking of this, you laughed and walked into the banquet.
你在宴会之上左拥右抱，花天酒地，过得好不惬意。一直享乐至深夜，这才醉醺醺地返回自己的住所。¤You hugged right and left at the banquet, spent a lot of time and wine, and had a very uncomfortable life. You have been enjoying yourself until late at night, and then you return to your residence drunkly.
今日寻你是为了让你替我监视一个人。事情办成后法器、功法和丹药任你挑选，其它的事情你无需知晓。¤I'm looking for you today to let you monitor someone for me. After the event is completed, you can choose from the magic artifacts, exercises, and medicines. You don't need to know about other things.
今朝有酒今朝醉，放着如此人间极乐不去享受，这才是一种罪过。¤There is wine now and now drunk, and it is a sin to not enjoy it with such bliss in the world.
你这几日在宁王府内左拥右抱，花天酒地，过得好不惬意。¤You have hugged left and right in Prince Ning's Mansion these few days, spending a lot of time and drinking, having a very uncomfortable life.
敢问道友，我还有其他选择吗？¤Dare to ask fellow daoists, do I have other options?
求道之路遍地诱惑，漫漫修真途中，真能坚守道心一往直前的修士又有几何？难道余生真要交代此地，与长生失之交臂？¤The road of seeking Taoism is full of temptations, and how can a cultivator who can really stick to the Taoist heart go forward during the long journey of cultivation? Is it true that Yu Sheng really wants to explain this place and miss the longevity?
不错，恰好是{$linghe}枚灵核，道友请。¤Good, it happens to be {$linghe} a spiritual core, daoist friend please.
道友此番在灵脉内共采集了{$linghe}个月，按规矩，道友需要向我们缴纳{$linghe}枚灵核，或是{$lingshi}灵石。¤Daoist has been collecting within the spirit veins for a total of {$linghe} months, and according to the rules, Daoist needs to pay us {$linghe} spirit cores, or {$lingshi} spirit stones.
不错，恰好是{$lingshi}灵石，道友请。¤Not bad, it happens to be {$lingshi} spirit stones, daoist friend please.
切不可轻视天魔眼中的魔物，我当年在试炼时也险些送了性命。¤Don't underestimate the monster in the eyes of the demon. I almost lost my life when I was trying.
我派虽是剑派，但也有诸多金属性功法传承。¤Although our school is a sword school, it also has many metal skills.
那两位修士本就胜在人数，有了你的加入，黑心老人很快便制服了对手。¤The two cultivators are already superior in number. With your joining, the evil old geezer soon overpowered his opponent.
言罢，黑心老人祭出一颗通体鲜红的珠子，缓缓将灵力送入其内。随着灵力的灌溉，那颗珠子红光大盛，几乎是一瞬间便将你们击败的修士笼罩在内。¤After that, the Grandfather Blackheart sacrificed a bright red bead and slowly sent his spiritual power into it. With the irrigation of spiritual power, the bead became very red, and it was the cultivator who defeated you almost instantly. Shielded in it.
本座思来想去，以你目前的修为，还是我参悟的《忘忧诀》对你帮助最大。¤I think about it. With your current cultivation base, the Worry-forgetting Jue that I have enlightened can help you the most.
殷红的血液从他们的皮肤渗出，汇成汩汩涓流被嗜血珠吞噬，几声惨叫过后，那两位古神教修士便化作两具干尸扑倒在地。¤Yin red blood oozes from their skin, converges into a gurgling stream and is swallowed by bloodthirsty beads. After a few screams, the two ancient gods cultivators turned into two corpses and fell to the ground.
本座于这宁州古迹中还有要事未解决，便先行离去了。¤There are still important issues that have not been resolved in this historic site in Ning Province, so I left first.
这次能够解决他们，还是多亏了你的帮助。¤I was able to solve them this time thanks to your help.
叫你们打主意到我的嗜血珠身上，现在就告诉你们什么叫自讨苦吃！¤I asked you to come up with my bloodthirsty bead, and now I will tell you what it means to ask for trouble!
此功法乃是机缘巧合之下所得的残本，突破元婴后，我费尽心血将其补齐。若此功法修炼有成，便可在交战时沟通天地灵气，令你实力大增。¤This technique is a remnant obtained by chance and coincidence. After breaking through the Nascent Soul, I worked hard to fill it up. If this technique is successful, you can communicate the spiritual energy of heaven and earth during battle, and make you powerful. increase.
环视一周，场上的宁州化神们正尽力拖住血剑宫和天魔道的化神强者。与血河战斗时翻涌的气血尚未平复，但此时此刻，你又怎能坐视不理。¤Looking around the field, the Ning Province Deity Transformation cultivators were doing their best to stall the Blood Sword techniques and Heavenly Demon Dao Deity Transformation powerhouses. The blood that surged during the battle with the Blood River has not yet subsided, but at this moment, how can you sit back and do nothing?
你刚要松一口气，却看见一名拄着权杖的神秘老者不知何时出现在了白帝的身后，此人神识修为深不可测，再加上众人都被玄骨吸引了注意力，竟无一人发现了他。¤You are just about to breathe a sigh of relief when you see a mysterious old man with a scepter appear behind the White Emperor at some point. This man's soul sense cultivation is unfathomable, plus the fact that all the people are attracted by the Xuan Bones, none of them have even noticed him.
与此同时，那老者将手中的权杖凭空一柱，一道恐怖的能量波向着已经没有任何防护的白帝背后袭去。¤At the same time, the old man threw the sceptre in his hand out of thin air, and a terrifying wave of energy struck at the back of the already unprotected White Emperor.
老者用沙哑而诡异的声音喃喃自语着，却并没有急着继续出手的意思。¤The old man muttered in a hoarse and eerie voice, but had no intention of rushing on with his strike.
据我所知，星宫主与那白帝素无交情。你当真要为了他与我古神教为敌？¤As far as I know, the Star Palace Master has no friendship with that White Emperor. Do you really want to make an enemy of my Ancient God Sect for his sake?
还未等众人反应过来，那老人一个踏步就出现在白帝身侧，伸手便要夺那诛仙剑。¤Before the crowd could react, the old man appeared at the side of the White Emperor with a single step and reached out to snatch the Immortal Punishing Sword.
当年古神教蛊惑我派长老，还害死鸾儿，你当本宫忘了不成？¤When the Ancient God Sect bewitched our elders and killed Luan'er, do you think my palace has forgotten?
古神教功法虽说也修神识，但在星宫法术面前却全无半点优势，被全力出手的星凝打得节节败退。¤Although the Ancient God Sect technique also cultivates soul sense, it has no half-way advantage over the Star Palace spells, and is beaten back by the full strength of the Star Condensation.
你猛的看向白帝，只发现一个老人正拄着拐踏空而来，悄无声息的从背后接近了白帝。此人神识修为深不可测，再加上众人都被玄骨吸引了注意力，竟无一人发现了他。¤You look fiercely at the White Emperor, only to find that an old man is stepping into the air on crutches, silently approaching the White Emperor from behind. This man's soul sense cultivation was unfathomable, and with the crowd's attention drawn to the Xuan Bones, none of them had even noticed him.
白帝手中凭空凝聚出一柄灵气巨剑，就要向那老者砍去。谁知诛仙剑却先动了，一道虚影从剑中飞出，驱使着飞剑刺向那人。¤A giant sword of aura coalesced out of thin air in the White Emperor's hand and was about to slash at the old man. Who knew that the Immortal Punishing Sword would move first, and a shadow flew out from the sword, driving the flying sword to stab the man.
去。¤Go.
环视一周，场上的宁州化神们正尽力拖住血剑宫和天魔道的化神强者。虽没有拦住他的信心，但此时此刻，你又怎能坐视不理。¤Looking around the field, the Ning Province Deity Transformation were doing their best to stall the Blood Sword Kung Fu and Heavenly Demon Dao Deity Transformation powerhouses. Although they do not have the confidence to stop him, how can you sit back and do nothing at this moment.
诛仙剑的攻击显然大大出乎老者的预料，但白帝的攻击接踵而至，来不及细想，他只能闪身向后避开。¤The attack of the Immortal Punishing Sword was obviously greatly unexpected by the old man, but the attacks of the White Emperor followed one after another, and there was no time to think carefully, so he could only dodge backwards to avoid them.
老人并没有理会你，而是看向正魔两道化神交战之处，似乎在确认什么。¤The old man does not pay any attention to you, but looks towards the place where the two Deity Transformation of good and evil are fighting, as if confirming something.
轩儿，你专心应对最后两道天劫，不必管我。¤Xuan'er, concentrate on the last two heavenly tribulations, don't bother about me.
你什么时候发现我的？¤When did you find out about me?
可是...¤But...
这些年来的旧账，今日本宫就好好与你算算！¤I'll settle the old scores with you today!
你就是当年失踪的御剑门掌门吧？竟然用自己的魂魄封印了诛仙剑，倒是把我也骗过了。¤You are the missing Royal Sword Sect Master back then, right? You used your own soul to seal the Immortal Punishing Sword, but you fooled me too.
{vpunch=10,0.5}“轰”¤{vpunch=10,0.5}''boom''
你玩的这些小把戏，可骗不了本宫。¤These little tricks you play will not fool this palace.
不对...古神教布局多年，怎会只有玄骨一人来冒险夺剑？¤That's not true... The Ancient Gods Sect has been setting up for years, how could Xuan Bone be the only one to risk taking the sword?
只见那老者将手中的权杖凭空一柱，一道恐怖的能量波向着已经没有任何防护的白帝背后袭去。¤Only to see the old man pillar the scepter in his hand out of thin air, and a terrifying wave of energy struck at the back of the already unprotected White Emperor.
这诛仙剑好像也发生了一些变化，有意思...莫非是吞噬了什么了不得的东西？¤This Immortal Punishing Sword seems to have undergone some changes as well... interesting... Could it be that it has devoured something extraordinary?
怎么？你也配教本宫做事？¤What? Are you worthy to teach me what to do?
你见星凝已经压制住了玄骨，刚松一口气，突然却有一种莫名的危机感涌上心头。¤You are just relieved to see that Xingning has suppressed Xuanbone, but suddenly an inexplicable sense of crisis rushes over you.
残余的能量波结结实实的撞在白帝的身上，震得他整个人向后一飘，嘴角也沁出了血丝。还未等众人反应过来，那老人一个踏步就出现在白帝身侧，伸手便要夺那诛仙剑。¤The residual wave of energy hit Emperor Bai's body solidly, causing him to drift backwards and blood to seep out of the corner of his mouth. Before the crowd could react, the old man appeared at the side of Emperor Bai with a single step and reached out to grab the Immortal Punishing Sword.
难怪你在那种情况下也可以脱离魔神蛊的控制，能耐真是不小。¤No wonder you could break free from the control of the Demon God Compulsion even under those circumstances, your ability is really not small.
古神教的蛆虫，终于忍不住要动手了？¤The maggots of the Ancient God Cult, finally unable to resist?
你到底是谁？¤Who the hell are you?
当年古神教蛊惑我派长老，令星宫名誉扫地，你当本宫忘了不成？¤Back then, the Ancient Gods Sect bewitched the elders of our sect and brought the Star Palace into disrepute, do you think this Palace has forgotten?
老人扬了扬眉，似乎有些惊讶，却并未理会你，而后看向正魔两道化神交战之处，似乎在确认什么。¤The old man raises his eyebrows, seemingly a little surprised, but ignores you, and then looks towards where the two Deity Transformation of good and evil are fighting, as if to confirm something.
你虽然不知道老人在想什么，但眼下最关键的是保护白帝渡劫，因此你只是小心戒备，拖延时间。¤Although you don't know what the old man is thinking, the most crucial thing at the moment is to protect the White Emperor from the tribulation, so you just watch out and stall for time.
师父，你？¤Master, you?
太晚了，老者的攻击紧追着刚刚落下的雷劫便应声而至。来不及闪避了，那道能量波结结实实的撞在白帝的身上，将他震飞出去，口中也吐出一口鲜血。¤Too late, the old man's attack arrived in response to the thunderclap that had just fallen. Too late to dodge, the wave of energy hit Emperor Bai's body solidly, sending him flying and spitting a mouthful of blood out of his mouth.
住手！¤Stop!
你正看着星凝的战况，上方第七道雷劫却应声落下，砸在白帝的灵气护罩上。灵气护罩又一次烟消云散，但白帝却毫发无伤。¤You are watching the battle in Xingning when the seventh thunderbolt above falls in response, smashing into Emperor Bai's aura shield. Once again, the aura shield goes up in smoke, but the White Emperor is unharmed.
虽然已经有人注意到了这里发生的情况，但化神强者交手又岂能说停就停。四溢碰撞的灵气若是强行收回，只会击伤自己。¤Although someone had already noticed what was happening here, how could a fight between a strong person of the Deity Transformation stop just like that? If the colliding auras were forced to retract, they would only injure themselves.
秘术已经被中断了...看来是天意如此吧。¤The secret art has been interrupted... It seems to be God's will that it should be so.
哼~¤Hm~
星凝的声音突然从身后传来，而被她拦住的人，正是在宁州古迹中夺走戮仙剑的玄骨老祖，此刻正面色铁青的看着星凝。¤Xing Ning's voice suddenly came from behind her, and the person she had stopped was none other than Patriarch Dark Bones, who had taken away the Immortal Executing Sword in the Ning Province monument, and was now looking at Xing Ning with a grimace.
你一张手，将诛仙剑收回手中，只身拦在老者与白帝之间。¤With one hand, you take the Immortal Punishing Sword back into your hand and stop only between the old man and the White Emperor.
白帝勉强提起一口气来，凝聚出一柄灵气巨剑，就要向那老者砍去。谁知诛仙剑却先动了，一道虚影从剑中飞出，驱使着飞剑刺向那人。¤The White Emperor barely lifted a breath and gathered a huge sword of aura, about to slash at the old man. Who knew that the Immortal Punishing Sword would move first, as a shadow flew out from the sword and drove the flying sword to stab the man.
第七道雷劫应声落下，砸在白帝的灵气护罩上。一声巨大的“轰隆”声后，灵气护罩再一次烟消云散。¤The seventh thunderbolt fell in response, smashing against Emperor Bai's aura shield. After a loud ''rumble'', the aura shield dissipated once again.
来不及完全闪避了，白帝一边向后方飞退，一边驱使剩余的护体剑气向那道能量波飞去。它们虽然无法完全挡住这道攻势，但也削弱了它不少的威能。¤It was too late to completely dodge it, so the White Emperor flew backwards while driving the remaining protective Sword Qi towards the wave of energy. They could not completely block the attack, but they had weakened its power quite a bit.
过了一会儿，他似乎发现了什么，脸上突然露出一抹诡谲的笑容。而后只是轻轻扫了你一眼，你便感到一股巨大的威压向你笼罩而来...¤After a while, he seems to notice something and a sly smile suddenly appears on his face. And then with just a slight sweep of his eyes, you feel a great pressure looming over you...
放心吧师兄，接下来就交给我了。¤Don't worry brother, I'll take care of the rest.
嗯？剑中之灵...¤Hmm? The Spirit of the Sword...
想从我手上抢剑？我倒要看看你有几分本事。¤Want to snatch the sword from my hand? I'd like to see how much you're capable of.
你是{FirstName}{LastName}道友？¤Are you a friend of {FirstName}{LastName}?
哈哈，我前些时日突破金丹，正打算去无尽之海上历练一番。听父亲说海上龙族凶猛，要我多加小心。日后{xiongdi}若是出海也得谨慎些！¤Haha, I broke through the golden core a few days ago, and I was planning to go to the endless sea to experience some. I heard my father say that the sea dragons are fierce, so I must be more careful. If {xiongdi} goes out to sea in the future, I have to be more cautious!
诸位道友，本次宗门大比已决出了前四位弟子，他们都是我派年轻一辈中的精英，肩负着我派的未来。¤Dear fellow daoists, the first four disciples have been decided in this Zongmen Grand Competition. They are all the elites of the younger generation of my school, and they are shouldering the future of my school.
很好，这是任务奖励，辛苦你了。我还有宗门事务在身，恕不远送。¤Very well, this is a reward for the mission. Thanks for your hard work. I still have clan business to attend to, so I'm sorry I won't see you off.
没想到这家伙还有两下子...算了，我还是下次再来吧。¤Unexpectedly, this guy will have two more...Forget it, I'll come again next time.
搞定，回去交差！¤It's done, go back for business!
没想到，长老作为炼丹长老在阵法上的造诣也是了得，晚辈佩服。¤I didn't expect that the elder as an alchemist elder is also excellent in formation attainment, my junior admires it.
你开始检查各个草药的生长情况，并通过自己草药理解对药材的生长环境做出调整。¤You start to check the growth of individual herbs and make adjustments to the growing conditions of the herbs through your own herbal understanding.
只见他催动手中的信物，眼前笼罩着药田的光幕撤去。一阵草木灵气迸发而出，不过当他们触及药园边缘时，又被聚拢回来并没有散溢出去。¤As he moved the token in his hand, the curtain of light that had enveloped the medicinal field before him withdrew. A burst of grass and wood aura burst out, but when they touched the edge of the medicinal garden, they were gathered back together and did not spill out.
呼~我门还是先办正事吧。¤Phew~ We'd better get down to business first.
长老，您还有别的吩咐么？¤Elder, do you have any other orders?
不好...¤Not good...
好了，这药园应该没有什么隐患了。¤Well, there should be no more hidden dangers in this herb garden.
不过，远处一道遁光赶来，来者更换了阵基，灵气外溢也就止住了。¤However, a transported light arrived in the distance and the overflow of aura was stopped when the visitor replaced the formation base.
你手掐法诀隔空就修复了那块阵基上的灵纹，同时草木灵气也停止了泄露。¤With a handful of spells spaced out, you repair the spirit patterns on that formation base, while the grass and wood aura stops leaking.
别慌。¤Don't panic.
您就是来维护宗门药田的{FirstName}长老吧。您是要现在开始么？¤You are the elder {FirstName} who has come to maintain the clan's medicinal fields, right? Do you want to start now?
药园的草木灵气开始缓缓外泄。¤The aura of the herbs and trees in the medicinal garden began to slowly leak out.
我这就打开禁制。¤I'll open the restriction here.
以你的阵道造诣很难分辨出这是什么阵法，更别提如何修复。¤With your formation attainment it would be difficult to tell what kind of formation it is, let alone how to fix it.
有劳长老了。¤Thank you, Elder.
此时药园边的一块阵基，其上铭刻的灵纹在一阵闪烁之后消失了，药园的聚灵阵似乎出现了一个缺口。¤At this moment, a piece of the formation base at the edge of the medicinal garden, the spiritual pattern inscribed on it disappeared after a flash, and a gap seemed to have appeared in the medicinal garden's spirit gathering formation.
你不过扫视一眼，你分辨出这阵法不过是一改良的巨型聚灵阵罢了。¤You merely scanned the formation and you discerned that it was nothing more than a modified giant spirit gathering formation.
哈哈哈，举手之劳何足挂齿我门还是先办正事吧。¤Hahahaha, what's the point of raising your hand? We'd better get down to business first.
你们几个，跟我去验货，剩下的人赶紧清理现场，千万不要留下活口！¤You guys, follow me to inspect the goods, and the rest of you should quickly clean up the scene, don't leave alive!
老大，都搞定了！¤Boss, it's all done!
哈哈哈哈，这么轻松就得手了，这在广陵城赫赫有名的百里家也不过如此。¤Hahahaha, it's so easy to succeed, and this is nothing more than the famous Baili Family in Guangling City.
（这赤炎灵阵果然厉害，要是没有这阵法的辅助，那些百里家的护卫也不好对付。）¤(This Red Flame Spirit Formation is really powerful. Without the aid of this formation, those Baili family guards would not be easy to deal with.)
对方进洞府没多久，就反身一道遁光直奔古月寨方向。¤Not long after the other party entered the cave, he reversed himself and headed straight for Gu Yue Cottage with a vanish of light.
一路潜行，你跟着她来到巫山脚下。¤Sneaking along, you follow her to the foot of Witch Mountain.
你将冰心石收入储物袋，随后破水而出。因你取走了其中的一部分，那令人不适的吸力减轻了不少，三眼灵猴已到潭边静静地等候着。¤You put the ice core stone in the storage bag, and then broke through the water. Because you took a part of it, the uncomfortable suction power is reduced a lot, and the three-eyed monkey has come to the pool and waited quietly.
应该是冰心石...连我的魂魄都有所波动，年份大约有万年以上了。¤It should be an ice heart stone... even my soul has fluctuated, and the age is about ten thousand years or more.
随着你的靠近，那股吸力愈来愈强。而那只三眼灵猴早在五尺外停下脚步，不安分地抓耳挠腮，看起来十分不适。¤As you get closer, the suction gets stronger and stronger. And the three-eyed monkey stopped five feet away, scratching his head restlessly, looking very uncomfortable.
它急切地拉扯着你的衣服，同时用前肢比划着一个方向，似乎是在催促你过去。¤It eagerly tugs at your clothes, and at the same time gestures in a direction with its forelimbs, seeming to urge you to pass.
你敏锐地察觉到魏无极的身形在靠近这些石头时，也会轻微地变形。¤You are keenly aware that Wei Wuji's figure deforms slightly when he approaches these stones.
看样子它想带你来的地方就是这里了，不知这里有什么奇妙之处，连你这等修为都无法维持神识的稳定。¤It seems that the place it wants to bring you here is here. I don't know what's wonderful here. Even your cultivation level can't maintain the stability of your spiritual consciousness.
你用灵气照亮漆黑的潭底，一片幽幽的荧光与你的灵气交相呼应。¤You illuminate the dark bottom of the pool with your aura, and a faint glow echoes with your aura.
扭曲的辉光让你看不清这些石头原本的模样，只得求助于魏无极。¤The twisted glow makes you lose sight of the original appearance of these stones, so you have to turn to Wei Wuji for help.
冰心石...？¤Ice Heart Stone...?
三眼灵猴时不时停下手舞足蹈地示意你转向，一人一猴在山中摸索了不少时间，最终来到一片寒潭前。¤The three-eyed monkeys stop and dance from time to time to signal you to turn. One person and one monkey groped for a long time in the mountains, and finally came to a cold pool.
让我看看...¤let me see...
呼，也算是帮杜老二报了一箭之仇…¤Phew, that's a bit of revenge for Du Lao Er...
你摆了摆手，三眼灵猴领会了你的意思，转身消失在了山林间。¤You waved your hand, the three-eyed monkey understood what you meant, and turned around and disappeared in the mountains and forests.
你心领神会，朝着三眼灵猴指出的方向御剑而起。那灵猴跟在你的剑下，竟丝毫不逊遁术之速。¤You know it with your heart, and rise with the sword in the direction pointed by the three-eyed monkey. The monkey is following your sword, and it is not inferior to the speed of escape.
随着下潜深度的提升，你感到神识被拉扯的感觉愈发强烈，到达潭底后，吸力的加强才堪堪停止。¤As the depth of the dive increases, you feel the sense of being pulled more and more intensely. After reaching the bottom of the pool, the increase in suction can stop.
你纵身跃入水中，潭中的水并无任何特别之处，看来这股吸力的源头并非潭水本身。¤You jump into the water. There is nothing special about the water in the pool. It seems that the source of this suction is not the pool water itself.
你没切几块便感到疲累如斯，脑内传来剧烈的刺痛，只得就此作罢。¤You felt so tired after not cutting a few pieces, and there was a severe tingling pain in your brain, and you had to give up.
你抵抗着这股神秘的力量，决定去潭中一窥端倪。¤You resisted this mysterious force and decided to go to Tanzhong to get a glimpse of it.
不错，此物用于炼器可增强使用者的神识，其中百年冰心石功效最弱，其次是千年冰心石，这万年冰心石可谓极其罕见。¤Yes, this thing can be used for refining to enhance the user's spiritual sense, of which the 100-year ice core stone has the weakest effect, followed by the thousand-year ice core stone. This 10,000-year ice core stone is extremely rare.
见你平安上岸，三眼灵猴友好地朝你挥了挥手，转身消失在山林间。¤Seeing you go ashore safely, the three-eyed monkey waved at you friendly, turned and disappeared in the mountains and forests.
“这灵猴这副模样...也不知这水潭是好是坏......”¤This monkey looks like...I don't know if this pool is good or bad...
以神识采撷的天材地宝你还是第一次见，你小心地以神识聚成的利刃去切割岩壁上的冰心石。¤This is the first time you have seen the treasures of heaven, material and earth picked with divine consciousness. You carefully used the sharp blade of divine consciousness to cut the ice core stone on the rock wall.
你感到有什么正轻轻地扯着你的衣角，回头一看正和那只三眼灵猴对上视线。¤You feel something is gently pulling at the corner of your clothes, and looking back, you are looking at the three-eyed monkey.
本着生生不息之道，你利落地收集了一半的冰心石。¤In the way of everlasting life, you collected half of the ice core stone neatly.
你嗖嗖嗖地切下几块，感到头脑有些发晕时便停下了动作。¤You swish and cut off a few pieces, and stopped when you felt a little dizzy in your mind.
那寒潭仿佛有什么吸力一样，不断地想要将你的神识扯离你的身体。¤That cold pool seems to have some suction, constantly trying to pull your consciousness away from your body.
还未接近寒潭，你便察觉到其中蕴含着巨大的能量，甚至连你的神识都受到了影响。¤Not yet close to the cold pool, you realize that there is a huge amount of energy in it, and even your spiritual consciousness is affected.
你可以神识凝刃，将此物从岩壁上割下，此举也能凝练你的神识。¤You can condense the blade of God's consciousness and cut this thing from the rock wall. This move can also condense your God's consciousness.
吱吱！¤Squeak!
吱吱！吱吱吱吱！¤Squeaky! Squeaky!
你顺着这股阴冷的气息一路追踪过去，很快便来到一处隐蔽的洞府外...¤You followed this cold breath all the way to the past, and soon came to a hidden cave outside...
只见一条巨蟒向你咬了过来。¤I saw a giant python bite at you.
只见一头岩鳄向你咬了过来。¤I saw a rock crocodile biting at you.
桀桀桀，又有新鲜的魂魄送上门来了。¤Jie Jie Jie, another fresh soul is delivered to the door.
你猜测这些失踪的凡人应该是被沂山派的修士拦路截杀，目的是夺取他们的商品与钱财。但你在此处兜兜转转找了几天，也没有找到那名“沂山派的修士”，只能就此作罢。¤You guess that these missing mortals were intercepted by cultivators of the Yishan faction in order to seize their goods and money. But you went around here for a few days, and you didn't find the name Yishan faction. cultivator, I can only give up.
现场的打斗痕迹看起来不像修真者所留下的，倒更像凡人之间的打斗。¤The fighting marks on the scene don't look like those left by the cultivators, but more like the fights between mortals.
你猜测这些失踪的凡人应该是被附近的妖兽所害，但你在此处兜兜转转找了几天，也没有发现那只“妖兽”，只能就此作罢。¤You guessed that these missing mortals were killed by nearby monsters, but you went around here for a few days and didn't find that monster, so you can just give up.
那些传闻中的失踪案件大多都发生在这儿附近，要先从何处开始调查呢？¤Most of the rumored disappearance cases occurred near here. Where do we start the investigation first?
你猜测这些失踪的凡人应该是被附近的山贼强盗，目的是夺取他们的商品与钱财。但你在此处兜兜转转找了几天，也没有找到那群“山贼”，只能就此作罢。¤You guess that these missing mortals should be bandits and bandits nearby, with the purpose of taking their goods and money. But you have been going around here for a few days, and you haven't found the group of bandits. Let it go.
你施展神识在附近探查，很快便找到一处隐藏于山林之中的强盗窝点。那些普通凡人哪里是你的对手，三下五除二便被你打得四散逃跑，想来是不敢再回此地作恶了。¤You used your divine knowledge to explore nearby, and soon you found a robber den hidden in the mountains and forests. Those ordinary mortals where your opponents are, you will be beaten up and run away. I don't dare to think about it. Go back here and do evil again.
你顺着这些痕迹一路追踪过去，很快便来到一处隐蔽的洞穴处...¤You followed these traces all the way to the past, and soon came to a hidden cave...
从现场的痕迹判断，这些失踪的凡人应该是被什么妖兽给杀害了。¤Judging from the traces on the scene, these missing mortals should have been killed by some monster.
距离此处不远就是几座凡人村落，而这里原本是他们前往大城市的必经之路，如今却人烟稀少。¤Not far from here are a few mortal villages, and this place was originally the only way for them to go to the big city, but now it is sparsely populated.
你猜测这些失踪的凡人应该是被禾山道的邪修，施展炼魂的邪术所伤。但你在此处兜兜转转找了几天，也没有找到那名“邪修”，只能就此作罢。¤You guessed that these missing mortals were injured by the evil cultivator of Heshan Dao and the sorcery of soul refining. But you have been going around here for a few days, and you haven't found the evil cultivator. You can only Let it go.
看来导致附近凡人失踪的原因应该是...？¤It seems that the reason for the disappearance of nearby mortals should be...?
道友来找我何事？¤What is my friend coming to see me for?
此事紧急道友还是快快行动。¤This matter is urgent, fellow Daoist still act quickly.
长老，之前托你办得事情完成的怎么样了？¤Elder, how was the work done by you before?
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为外务长老怕是不能服众。¤With your reputation in the clan, I am afraid that if you were to become an Outer Elder you would not be able to convince the public.
在结婴的过程中，一旦意志受损过于严重，心魔对你的影响也会变得更大。¤In the process of breaking through, once your mental's damage is too severe, the influence of the devil inside your heart will become even greater.
此次古迹内发生之事我已知晓，当年遗失的四柄魔剑，如今魔门已得其三，唯有诛仙剑仍下落不明。¤I already know what happened in the historic site. The four magic swords that were lost back then now have three of them, and only the Zhuxian sword is still missing.
算算时间，距离下一次古迹出世也已经只有{$wubai}年了。到时候，宗门内一些修为高深的长老也会参与其中。¤Calculating the time, it is only {$wubai} years before the next monument was born. At that time, some of the elders with advanced cultivation in the sect will also participate.
说来，我派传承万年，其实有不少的功法与神通都在这漫漫年月中失传了。¤Speaking of, Our Sect it to pass on for thousands of years. In fact, many of the exercises and supernatural powers have been lost during these long years.
唔...你对于炼丹一道的造诣恐怕还无法胜任我派炼丹长老的职责。¤Well... I am afraid that your attainments in the art of alchemy are not up to the task of being the Alchemist Elder of my school.
以后就有劳了。¤I'll be in your debt in the future.
只是上一次古迹出世之时，那位携带仙剑的长老命陨其中，这仙剑也就此下落不明。¤It's just that when the monument was born last time, the elder who carried the fairy sword died in it, and the whereabouts of the fairy sword is also unknown.
千年前那一次古迹出世，我派损伤惨重。当年的大长老衍复真人被卷入乱流之中，未能脱身，至今还被困在那片空间之中。¤Thousands of years ago, when the monuments came out, our sect was heavily damaged. The Grand Elder Yanfu Zhenren was caught in the turbulence and could not get out of it. He is still trapped in that space.
{FirstName}长老此番若是也想前往古迹，或许可以帮宗门多多留意一番。若有幸能找回宗门传承，那也算是宗门之幸了。¤If the elder {FirstName} also wants to go to the monuments, maybe he can help the sect to pay more attention to it. If he is lucky enough to be able to retrieve the sect inheritance, that would be the luck of the sect.
{FirstName}长老此番若是也想前往古迹，还请务必帮宗门多多留意一下这柄仙剑的下落。若能寻得此剑，那也算是宗门之幸了。¤If the elder {FirstName} also wants to go to the monuments, please be sure to help Zongmen pay more attention to the whereabouts of this fairy sword. If you can find this sword, then it would be the luck of the Zongmen.
{FirstName}长老，你上次任职至今还未满50年，你还是{$TempValue}年之后再过来吧。¤{FirstName}Elder, it is not yet 50 years since you last served, so you might as well {$TempValue} come back in a year's time.
呃.....{FirstName}长老，你还是先把手头的任务处理好再来找我吧。¤Uh ..... {FirstName}Elder, you might as well take care of the task at hand before you come to me.
经脉的强度和你对炼体与炼气之道的感悟息息相关，对这两条大道的感悟越深，经脉的强度就越高，这对于是否能够成功突破异常的重要。¤The strength of the meridians is closely related to your perception of the way of refining body and qi. The deeper your perception of these two avenues, the higher the strength of the meridians, which is important for whether you can successfully break through the anomaly.
实际上，我派曾经倾全派资源炼制过一套剑阵，共由五柄纯阳法宝级别的仙剑组成，威能不俗。¤Actually, my faction has used all the resources of the faction to refine a set of sword formations, consisting of five swords of the pure sun magic weapon level, which is very powerful.
不知师侄之前可否了解过，结婴其实是一个破而后立的过程，需要经过{color=#d0380a}碎丹{/color}与{color=#d0380a}化婴{/color}这两个步骤。¤I don’t know if my nephew has known before that nascent soul formation is actually a process of breaking down and building up. It needs to go through {color=#d0380a}breaking pill{/color} and {color=#d0380a}huaying{/color} step.
宗门暂时没有什么需要长老你处理的要事。¤The sect has nothing important for you to deal with at the moment.
很好，此事就拜托你了，还请长老务必抓紧时间。¤Very well, I will leave it to you on this matter, and the elders must hurry up.
掌门此番闭死关已有数百年之久，也不知能否在古迹出世前出关。若是无法突破瓶颈，恐怕只能道尽于此。¤The leader has been in retreat for hundreds of years, and I don't know whether he can leave before the monument is born. If you can't break through the bottleneck, I'm afraid I can only say that.
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为炼丹长老怕是不能服众。¤With your reputation in the clan, I am afraid that if you were to become an Alchemy Elder you would not be able to convince the public.
{FirstName}长老此番若是也想前往古迹，还请务必帮宗门多多留意一下火属性的矿石类材料。特别是像赤火元铜精这样的六品天才地宝，在宁州已是极难寻得，希望此次能在古迹中找到一些。¤If the elder {FirstName} also wants to go to the historical sites this time, please be sure to help Zongmen pay more attention to the fire-attribute mineral materials. Especially the sixth-rank genius earth treasures like the Chihuo Yuantong Jing, which are already in Ning Province. It's extremely difficult to find, I hope I can find some in the monuments this time.
既然长老琐事缠身，就先暂居挂名长老吧。¤Since the elders are tied up with trivial matters, they will stay as titular elders for the time being.
上古时期，宁州古迹所在之地也算是一座较为繁荣的城池。后因成为正魔大战的主战场而衰败，整片空间也由于巨大的灵力引起位面塌陷，被卷入了时空乱流中。¤In the ancient times, the place where the Ning Province monuments were located was also considered a relatively prosperous city. Later, it declined because it became the main battlefield of the battle between the real and the demons. The entire space was also collapsed due to the huge spiritual power, and was involved in time and space In the stream.
此番事了，长老你可以获得{$jiangli}。¤This matter, elders, you can get {$jiangli}.
若是还能找到其他能够在结婴时保护经脉与意志的丹药，自然也是多多益善。¤If there are other medicinal pills that can protect meridians and will at the time of nascent soul breakthrough, naturally the more is better.
要想在古迹内寻得机缘，最直接的方式便是前往当年古战场的核心区域，也就是{color=#d0380a}古原城{/color}。万年前因那场大战而遗失的功法传承，和通天法宝都有可能在那里寻得。¤The most direct way to find opportunities in the monuments is to go to the core area of ​​the ancient battlefield, which is {color=#d0380a}the ancient city{/color}. The merits lost in that battle thousands of years ago The inheritance of the law and the magic weapon of the sky may be found there.
在结婴的过程中，一旦经脉受损过于严重，还会直接影响吸收与运转灵气的速度。¤In the process of breakthrough, once the meridians are too severely damaged, it will directly affect the speed of absorption and operation of Reiki.
{FirstName}长老此番若是也想前往古迹，还请务必帮宗门多多留意一下当年失踪长老的下落。尽管希望渺茫，但以真人元婴巅峰的修为，如果能够成功突破，未必没有幸存的可能性。¤If the elder {FirstName} also wants to go to the monument this time, please keep an eye out for the whereabouts of the missing elder that year. Although the hope is slim, with the cultivation of the Elder, if they were able to successfully break through, they might have survived.
如若此时失败，轻则修为大退，重则全身经脉寸断，一身修为毁于一旦。¤If it fails at this time, the cultivation base will retreat in the slightest, and the meridians of the whole body will be broken, and the cultivation base will be destroyed.
{FirstName}长老想知道些什么？¤What does Elder {FirstName} want to know?
不过时间有限，若是{FirstName}长老不能在一年之内离开，到时候空间裂隙消失，只怕会被永远困在里面。¤However, time is limited. If the elder {FirstName} can't leave within a year, then the spatial rift will disappear, I'm afraid I will be trapped in it forever.
看来{FirstName}长老已经从别处得知了宁州古迹的消息。¤It seems that the elder {FirstName} has learned about the ancient sites in Ning Province from elsewhere.
{$TmpTalkString}，何事？¤{$TmpTalkString}, what is it?
{FirstName}长老还想知道些什么？¤What else does Elder {FirstName} want to know?
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为炼器长老怕是不能服众。¤With your reputation in the clan, I am afraid that you will not be able to convince the public if you become a weapon refining elder.
所以这结婴之关键，便在于突破者经脉与意志的强度。而除此以外，尽量多的收集结婴用的丹药与秘术也非常关键。¤So the key to this breakthrough is the strength of the breakthrough meridian and will. In addition, it is also very important to collect as many pills and occult techniques for the breakthrough as possible.
宁州古迹如今已经陷入时空乱流之中，要想进入那片空间，唯有趁千年一次空间壁障薄弱时强行闯入。¤The historic sites of Ning Province are now caught in the turbulence of time and space. If you want to enter that space, you can only forcibly break in when the space barrier is weak once in a thousand years.
{FirstName}长老，宗门若有是什么事宜我会第一时间传音给你的。¤{FirstName}Elder, if there is any matter in the clan I will be the first to pass on the message to you.
所谓碎丹，是当体内灵气饱和后，继续吸纳灵气，直到金丹碎裂的过程。在这个阶段中需经历全身经脉大损之痛苦，需一鼓作气，方可最大限度减少对{color=#d0380a}经脉{/color}的损伤。¤The so-called broken pill is the process of absorbing the aura until the pill is broken when the aura in the body is saturated. At this stage, you need to experience the pain of major damage to the meridians of the whole body, and you need to work hard to minimize the impact on {color=# d0380a}Injury to the meridians{/color}.
按往年的记录，这薄弱之处往往会出现在岫络谷的附近，到时仅需靠金丹期修为便可打开通道，进入宁州古迹所在的那片空间。¤According to the records of previous years, this weakness often appears in the vicinity of Xiuluo Valley. At that time, only the Jindan period cultivation base can open the passage and enter the space where the Ning Province historic sites are located.
唔...你对于炼器一道的造诣恐怕还无法胜任我派炼器长老的职责。¤Well... I am afraid that your attainment in the art of smithing is still not up to the task of being the Elder of my school.
自然是这样。只是一旦进入空间乱流后，便只能勉强控制自身方向，至于最后到底会被带向何处就无人可知了。¤Naturally. It's just that once you enter the space turbulence, you can barely control your own direction. As for where you will be taken in the end, no one knows.
若是重新让魔门找回全部得四柄魔剑，组成通天剑阵，恐对宁州各派不利啊。¤If the Demon Sect were to retrieve all the four Demon Swords to form a Heaven-Sword Formation, it would be unfavorable to the various factions in Ning Province.
因此，一旦进入古迹，最终还是得仰仗自身的实力，同门之间能否相遇尚且未知，恐怕难以指望。¤Therefore, once you enter the historic site, you still have to rely on your own strength in the end. It is still unknown whether the same family can meet, I am afraid it is difficult to count.
{FirstName}长老此番若是也想前往古迹，还请务必帮宗门多多留意一些有生息药性的高阶草药。特别是像炼心芝这样的五品仙草，在宁州已是极难寻得，希望此次能在古迹中找到一些。¤If Elder {FirstName} also wants to explore the ruins, please keep an eye out for high-end herbs with the great properties. Especially fifth-grade celestial herbs like the Heartrend Shroom are extremely rare in Ning Province. I only hope that it can be found some in ancient ruins.
一旦碎丹成功，开始化婴后，一边需要继续凝聚灵气，另一边还要经受心魔对{color=#d0380a}意志{/color}的考验。¤Once the broken pill is successful, after starting the nascent soul formation, one side needs to continue to condense the aura, and the other side has to withstand the test of the {color=#d0380a}will{/color} of the heart demon.
除此以外，很多已经在宁州几乎灭绝的珍贵草药和材料，也有可能在那片位面仍然存在，但想要找到这些东西，可就得看个人机缘了。¤In addition to this, many precious herbs and materials that have been almost extinct in Ning Province may still exist on that plane, but if you want to find these things, you have to look at personal opportunities.
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为授业长老怕是不能服众。¤With your reputation in the clan, I am afraid that if you were to become an Ordained Elder you would not be able to convince the public.
意志的强度主要由你的心境所决定，但除此以外，在神魂之道上的感悟也会对此有所帮助。¤The strength of the will is mainly determined by your state of mind, but in addition to this, the perception of the way of the soul will also help this.
结婴的秘术极为稀有，我派有一独门秘术唤作{$mishu}。但除此以外，你还应当尽量尝试收集其他的秘术。¤The secret technique of infant knotting is extremely rare. I have sent a unique secret technique called {$mishu}. But in addition to this, you should try to collect other secret techniques as much as possible.
{$TmpTalkString}，有何吩咐？¤{$TmpTalkString}, what are your orders?
结婴时，大活络丹与大醒神丹必不可少，这两种丹药可以帮你保护经脉，守灵台清明。它们的丹方在我派藏经阁秘阁内亦有记录。¤Great Revitalising Pills and Great Awakening Pills are indispensable when breaking through to Nascent Soul. These two Pills can help you protect the meridians and keep your mind palace stable. Their recipes have been recorded in the our Sect's Manual Hall.
果然厉害，我不是你的对手。¤Sure enough, I am not your opponent.
师弟，这是你的酬劳收好！！¤Junior Brother, this is your reward!
哈哈哈，到手了。¤Hahaha, I'm here.
谢师兄。¤Thank Brother.
师...{shixiong}，你怎么来了！¤Martial...{shixiong}, why are you here!
(~o~)哎...好困...¤(~o~) Hey... so sleepy...
看守药田的马师兄似乎睡着了...¤Brother Ma who guards the medicine field seems to be asleep...
我说的没错吧，是不是很奇怪？¤Am I right, isn't it strange?
五行剑诀可真是太帅了！{xiongdi}你什么时候背着我偷偷研究的！也太不够意思了吧！¤The Five Elements Sword Art is really cool! {xiongdi}When did you study it secretly behind my back! That's not cool at all!
这功法真是奇怪，快去石台那边读一读吧！一定不会让你失望的！¤This is a  strange technique, go read it over at the stone platform! It won't let you down!
没错，确实奇怪得很...看来是需要一段时间领悟一下。¤Yes, it does seem strange as hell... It seems to be taking a while to comprehend.
再往{color=#d0380a}西边{/color}走就是{color=#d0380a}枯木林{/color}了，你可千万别去那边。¤Further {color=#d0380a} west{/color} is {color=#d0380a} the Deadwood Forest{/color}, you don't want to go there.
不远处传来了一声喝止，你下意识收敛气息躲在了一旁。¤Not far away comes a shout, and you subconsciously collect your breath and hide away.
算了...你也别多想，这种事情不是你我能弄明白的，总之离远点就对了。¤Never mind... Don't think too much about it, it's not for you or me to figure out such things, just stay away anyway.
嘶……¤Hiss ......
只怕？¤Only afraid?
西边的小树林？倒是有些印象...莫非那里出了什么情况？¤The woods to the west? That rings a bell... Could there be something going on there?
哈哈哈哈，瞧把你吓的。¤Hahahahahaha, look what you've done.
那筑基修士刻意将声音放低，像是要说什么见不得人的东西似的。但以你的神识，听到这些也不成问题。¤The foundation cultivator deliberately lowered his voice, as if to say something unseemly. But with your soul sense, it's not a problem to hear this.
放心吧，化神可不会跟我们一样小家子气，不会计较这些的。¤Don't worry, the deity Transformation is not as petty as we are and will not take this into account.
听起来的确蹊跷...总之先去西边调查一下吧。¤It does sound fishy... Anyway, let's go to the west side first and investigate.
要知道，方壶山灵脉可是远近闻名的灵气充沛之地，各种千年灵药都能在此地生长，何况一片树林。只怕...¤You should know that the Fang Hu Mountain Spirit Vein is a place known far and wide for its abundant spiritual energy, and all kinds of thousand-year-old spiritual medicines can grow here, not to mention a forest. I am afraid...
只见那炼气修士倒吸一口凉气，惊出了一身冷汗。¤I just saw the Qi refining cultivator sucking in a breath of cold air and breaking out in a cold sweat.
只不过？¤Only?
能活一千多年，倘若没有服用些延年益寿的丹药，只怕已经达到化神境界了。¤If he hadn't taken some life prolonging pills, he would have reached the Deity Transformation realm.
你若想多活些时日，还是离他们远一点为好，不然一不小心触怒了他们…懂吗？¤If you want to live longer, you'd better stay away from them, or you'll offend them if you're not careful... understand?
是，晚辈明白。¤Yes, the junior understands.
难说…寻常修士即便到了元婴境界，也就只有一千寿元。¤It's hard to say...ordinary cultivators only have a thousand years of life even when they reach the Nascent Soul realm.
这是为何？难不成那边有什么危险吗？¤Why is this? Is it possible that there is some kind of danger over there?
别走那边！¤Don't go that way!
我听前辈说，那片树林百年前还是青翠如常，如今却枯萎成这副模样…¤I heard from my predecessors that the woods were as verdant as ever a hundred years ago, but now they have withered to this state...
听着，这方壶山住了两位活了上千年的长老，一位是{color=#d0380a}东边{/color}洞府中的明山散人，另一位便是这枯木林中的枯木老祖。¤Listen, there are two elders who have lived for thousands of years on this Fang Hu Mountain, one is {color=#d0380a} the Ming Mountain Scatterer in the {/color} cave to the east, and the other is the Deadwood Elder in this Deadwood Forest.
只不过…¤Only...
最近几年，我看这枯木林愈发阴森了。¤In the last few years, I have seen this deadwood forest become more and more eerie.
原来如此…他们活了这么久，至少也得有元婴修为吧？¤So that's how it is...they've lived for so long, they must have at least Nascent Soul cultivation, right?
化神大能手眼通天，我们这小声议论，说不定正被他们看着呢。¤The Deity Transformation masters have eyes in the sky, and they may be watching us as we whisper.
展开神识探查而去，原来是两名巡山的弟子——一名是筑基境界，而另一名只有炼气修为。¤When he opened his soul sense to investigate, it turned out to be two disciples who were patrolling the mountain - one was at the Foundation Establishment realm, while the other only had Qi Refining cultivation.
呼~~可算甩掉了。¤Huh~~ can be considered thrown away.
呼~~不愧是天机阁，在外面跑腿的都是金丹高手。¤Huh~~ As expected of Heavens Secrets Pavilion, those who run errands outside are all Jindan masters.
这些赃物自然是不能在宁州出手，不过我们在中州，渝州，幽州都有自己出货的渠道，所以不必担心。¤Of course, these stolen goods cannot be sold in Ning Province, but we have our own shipping channels in Zhongzhou, Yuzhou, and Youzhou, so don't worry.
我准备把门内的大阵重新启用起来，布此阵需要消耗大量的火铜精作为材料，我已经让其他弟兄去收集了，你也帮忙去收集一些吧，越多越好。¤I am going to reactivate the large formation in the door. The formation of this formation requires a large amount of fire copper essence as materials. I have asked other brothers to collect it. You can also help collect some. The more the better.
好，那我们出发。¤Okay, let's go.
你也知道，那颜老怪虽然有金丹修为，但大哥二哥联起手来想要逃命也是不成问题。那颜老怪气急败坏，便让他们禾山道的人来我们这里闹事。¤You also know that although Old Monster Yan has a golden core cultivation base, it is not a problem for Big Brother and Second Brother to join hands to escape. The Old Monster Yan is so frustrated, they let their Heshandao people come to us to make trouble.
你也不算外人，此事说来给你听倒也无妨，只是你切记不可到处宣扬。¤You are not an outsider, and it doesn't hurt to hear this to you, but you must remember not to promote it everywhere.
噢？你居然找到了这么多火铜精！这下大阵需要的材料应该够用了。¤Oh? You have found so many fire bronze spirits! The materials needed for this big formation should be enough.
嗯...这数量虽然不多，但也聊胜于无了。¤Well... Although this number is not large, it is better than nothing.
我收到下面弟兄们的消息，在九嶷山一带发现了百里家商队的踪迹，我准备带兄弟们，干他娘的一票大的。¤I received the news from the brothers below that I found traces of the Baili family caravan in Jiuyi Mountain. I am going to take the brothers and take care of the big one.
虽然有点风险，但百里家的商队运的可都是价值不菲的宝贝。这次我们提前进山，以阵法设伏。你马上去准备准备，我们这次一起出发。¤Although it is a bit risky, the caravans of Baili's family are all valuable treasures. This time we enter the mountain ahead of time and set up an ambush. You immediately prepare for it, and we set off together this time.
我只晓得这是件品质极高的法宝，光用神识探查就能感受到它的不凡。自从得了这件宝贝，大哥与二哥便{color=#d0380a}进山{/color}闭关研究去了，你若最近进山，也切记不要打扰到他们。¤I only know that this is a very high-quality magic weapon, and you can feel its extraordinary by exploring it with spiritual knowledge. Since acquiring this treasure, the eldest brother and the second elder brother {color=#d0380a}into the mountain{/color} retreat Research has gone, if you have recently entered the mountain, remember not to disturb them.
前段时日，大哥二哥与那禾山道的颜老怪一起去探了一处秘境。那颜老怪本来想利用我们帮他取宝，没想到反而被二哥给摆了一道，不仅没得到宝贝，还差点送了性命。¤A few days ago, the eldest brother and the second elder brother went to explore a secret realm together with the old monster Yan from the Heshan Road. The old monster Yan originally wanted to use us to help him collect treasures, but he did not expect that the second elder brother would give him one. I almost lost my life when I got the treasure.
好说好说，今后传音符联系。¤Good talk, future contact by messenger.
小{xiongdi}，你这次表现的也不错，这些灵石是给你的奖励。¤Little {xiongdi}, you did a good job this time. These spirit stones are a reward for you.
你来的晚，也难怪你不知道。他就是青面鬼，也就是我们沂山派的二当家。¤You came late, no wonder you didn't know. He is a green-faced ghost, that is, the second master of our Yishan school.
明白了，我这就去准备。¤Understood, I will prepare now.
这火铜精的数量是越多越好啊，{xiongdi}你还是再去找找吧。¤The more the quantity of this fire bronze spirit, the better, {xiongdi} you should look for it again.
百里...家？¤Baili...home?
哈哈哈哈，好好好，我果然没有看错你。¤Hahahaha, good, good, I didn't see you wrong as expected.
上次禾山道来捣乱，我们损失不小，很多弟兄如今都在养伤，丹药也已经不太够用了。¤The last time Heshan Dao came to make trouble, we lost a lot. Many brothers are now recovering from their injuries, and the medicine is not enough.
哎，这几颗可不够用啊。¤Hey, these few are not enough.
之前太让{xiongdi}你费心了，我这里暂时也没什么别的事了。¤It made {xiongdi} you bother too much before, and I don’t have anything else here for the time being.
{xiaozi}，今天来有什么事？¤{xiaozi}, what's the matter today?
明白，这事儿就交给我了¤Understood, leave this to me
百里家的这支商队运送的都是一些海妖兽的妖丹，虽然品质不算很高，但这种东西在内陆一直都非常稀有，我们这次算是收获颇丰了。¤This caravan of Baili's family is transporting some sea monster beast monster pills. Although the quality is not very high, this kind of thing has always been very rare in the inland. We have gained quite a lot this time.
哼，等大哥二哥弄清楚这宝贝的法门，到时候我们也就不用再怕这群禾山道的人了。¤Hmph, when the elder brother and the second brother figure out the method of this treasure, then we won't have to worry about these Heshandao people anymore.
杜老二戒备地看了你一眼¤Lao Du gave you a guarded look
多谢{xiongdi}你跑这一趟了，这些灵石你收着。¤Thank you {xiongdi} for running this time, you keep these spirit stones.
沃焦山有整个宁州最大的火铜矿脉，但那里属于离火门的管辖范围。好在火铜精也不算太珍贵的材料，你去广陵城的{color=red}百宝行{/color}应该就可以买到。¤Inferno Mountain has the largest fire copper vein in Ning Province, but it belongs to the Heavenly Fire Gate. Fortunately, the fire copper essence is not too precious. You can go to the {color=red} Baibao in Guangling City. You should be able to buy it with {/color}.
准备的怎么样了？¤How's your preparation?
禾山道又派人来我们沂山附近作乱，伤了我们好几个弟兄，你得想办法教训一下他们，叫他们知道沂山派可不是这么好惹的。¤Heshan Dao sent people to make chaos near our Yishan Mountain, hurting several of our brothers. You have to find a way to teach them, let them know that Yishan School is not so easy to provoke.
自从得了这件宝贝，大哥与二哥便{color=#d0380a}进山{/color}闭关研究了，你若最近进山，也切记不要打扰到他们。¤Since they got this treasure, the eldest brother and the second elder brother {color=#d0380a} entered the mountain{/color} to retreat and study. If you have recently entered the mountain, remember not to disturb them.
好了，如今二当家回来了，你这段时间为门派做出了不少贡献，这些我都会如实向二当家禀告的，你就先回去休息吧。¤Well, now that the second master is back, you have made a lot of contributions to the school during this period. I will truthfully report these to the second master. You should go back and rest first.
{xiaozi}，这可是两位老大的私事，你还是不要乱打听了。¤{xiaozi}, this is the private matter of the two bosses, you still don't want to inquire about it.
噢？你这找到的数量倒是不少，辛苦你跑这一趟了。¤Oh? You have found a lot of them. You have worked so hard to make this trip.
麻烦{xiongdi}你跑一趟，帮我收集{color=red}3颗化瘀丹{/color}来，给其它弟兄们服用。¤Thank you {xiongdi} for a trip, and help me collect {color=red}3 Novice Healing Pills{/color} for our other brothers to take.
不错的灵力，这霜熊绝非普通的筑基期妖兽实力，小心应对。¤Not bad spiritual power, this Frost Bear is definitely not an ordinary base-building monster strength, deal with it carefully.
道友，这补灵丹乃是家师所炼制。¤Friend, this Qi Caller Pill was synthesized by my master.
只可惜，你也是个跑腿的。¤Unfortunately, you are also an errand.
此事便交给我吧。¤Leave this to me.
{FirstName}道友可是从星宫听说的？¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName} heard from the Star Palace?
哈哈哈。¤Hahaha.
{FirstName}{$NickName}再次造访公孙府，可是有带来什么好消息？¤{FirstName}{$NickName} visited Gongsun Mansion again, but what good news did they bring?
你和公孙季寒暄一会后，便是告辞离去。¤After you and Gongsun Ji had a chat for a while, you said goodbye and left.
你从储物袋中取出此前所得战利品，随手丢给公孙季。¤You take out the spoils from the storage bag and throw them to Gongsun Ji.
不知公孙府所遇何事？¤I don't know what happened to Gongsun Mansion?
以{FirstName}{$NickName}与在下的关系，交换就不必了。请稍坐片刻，在下这就去命人取酒来。¤With the relationship between {FirstName}{$NickName} and under, the exchange is not necessary. Please sit down for a while, and then I'll order someone to fetch wine.
{FirstName}{$NickName}若是想要极品盈手露倒也不难，府内酒窖刚好还有几坛，只是公孙府遇到些棘手的事，现下...¤{FirstName}{$NickName} If you want the best, it's not difficult, there are just a few jars left in the mansion's wine cellar, but Gongsun Mansion has encountered some difficult things, and now...
公孙府正好遇到棘手之事，若是{FirstName}道友能为在下解决，自当将盈手露双手奉上。¤Gongsun's mansion just encountered a difficult matter, if fellow Taoist {FirstName} can solve it for me, I will show my hands and hands.
那在下便在府中等候{FirstName}道友的好消息。¤Then I will wait in the mansion for the good news from fellow Daoist {FirstName}.
来人，去取两坛极品盈手露。¤Come, go and get two jars of the best hand dew.
贵干不敢当，只是听说云汐城仙酿乃是宁州一绝，其中极品盈手露更是堪比仙酿。所以想上门讨要一坛，品品其中滋味。¤Guigan didn't dare to take it, but I heard that Yunxi City Immortal Brew is a must in Ning Province, and the top-quality Hand Dew is even comparable to Immortal Brew. So I want to go to the door to ask for an altar and taste it.
我想要两坛公孙府所酿极品盈手露，不知以何物交换才愿割爱？¤I want two jars of Gongsun Mansion's top-quality hand dew, but I don't know what to exchange to give up my love?
说来难以启齿，但既是{FirstName}{$NickName}相问，在下也就不藏着掖着了。¤It's hard to say, but since {FirstName}{$NickName} asked each other, she didn't hide it.
{FirstName}道友久等了。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName} has been waiting for a long time.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，请问来公孙府贵干？¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, may I ask you to come to Gongsun's Mansion?
公孙季听闻“极品”两字后神情一滞，随即面露难色，但终究还是将之埋入心里，转而以微笑面向你。¤Gongsun Ji's expression froze when he heard the word superior, and then his face became embarrassed, but after all, he buried it in his heart and turned to face you with a smile.
{FirstName}{$NickName}说笑了，只是宁州道友抬爱云汐城而已。纵是极品盈手露也不过是所含灵气与回味更为浓郁，仙酿实是不敢当。¤{FirstName}{$NickName} is joking, it's just that fellow Taoist Ning Province loves Yunxi City. Even if it is the best hand dew, it only contains more spiritual energy and aftertaste, and the immortal brew is really not dared.
近日府中有门人叛逃，此人约为金丹中期实力，如今也只知道他在逸风城与竹山宗交界处曾出现，且从围捕中逃脱后不知去向，料想还在那一带。¤Recently, there was a defector in the house. This person is about mid-Jindan strength, and we only know that he appeared at the border of Yifeng City and Zhushan Sect, and after escaping from the siege, he did not know where he was going.
极品...¤Excellent...
只消片刻，府内仆从便已是为你取来一坛盈手露。只一入手，隔着泥封你都能闻到独特的清香，神识扫过，坛内灵气之浓郁更是令人讶异，确是灵酒中的极品。¤In just a moment, the servants in the palace have brought a jar of hand dew for you. As soon as you start, you can smell the unique fragrance through the mud seal, and the spiritual sense swept over, the richness of the spiritual energy in the jar is even more surprising, it is indeed the best spirit wine.
公孙季说到此处便是面露难色，没有继续下去，你也是迅速领会其中深意。¤When Gongsun Ji said this, his face was embarrassed, and he didn't continue, and you quickly understood the meaning of it.
{FirstName}道友请在此休息片刻，待在下向大长老请示一番。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, please rest here for a while and ask the Great Elder for some instructions.
不愧是{FirstName}{$NickName}，我公孙府几十位修士围杀这叛徒半月几无进展，{FirstName}{$NickName}出手竟是手到擒来，佩服佩服。¤As expected of {FirstName}{$NickName}, the dozens of cultivators in my Gongsun Mansion had made no progress in besieging this traitor for half a month, but {FirstName}{$NickName} was able to capture it, admiring it.
近日有风雨楼中人无端叛逃，此人约为金丹中期实力，修有风雨楼秘术。如今也只知道他在逸风城与竹山宗交界处曾出现，且从围捕中逃脱后不知去向，料想还在那一带。¤Recently, a person in the Wind and Rain Building defected for no reason. This person is about the strength of Jindan in the middle stage and has the secret technique of the Wind and Rain Building. Now I only know that he appeared at the junction of Yifeng City and Zhushan Sect, and after escaping from the roundup, he disappeared, and it is expected that he is still in that area.
{size=26}星...{/size}¤{size=26}stars...{/size}
极品盈手露的存在乃是府中之秘，{FirstName}道友既然已经知悉其存在，在下也就不卖关子了。¤The existence of the top-quality hand-leaning dew is the secret of the mansion. Since fellow Daoist {FirstName} already knows of its existence, I will not sell it.
只消片刻，府内仆从便已是为你取来两坛盈手露。只一入手，隔着泥封你都能闻到独特的清香，神识扫过，坛内灵气之浓郁更是令人讶异，确是灵酒中的极品。¤In just a moment, the servants in the house have already brought two jars of hand dew for you. As soon as you start, you can smell the unique fragrance through the mud seal, and the spiritual sense swept over, the richness of the spiritual energy in the jar is even more surprising, it is indeed the best spirit wine.
来人，去为{FirstName}{$NickName}取两坛极品盈手露。¤The first thing you need to do is to get two altars of the best surplus hand dew for {FirstName}{$NickName}.
呃...没有？{size=26}难道星铃儿在耍我？{/size}¤uh... no? {size=26}Is Xing Linger playing tricks on me? {/size}
但是此人精通匿踪，一时难以...久闻{FirstName}{$NickName}战力超群，若是能为在下解除此忧，极品盈手露自会双手奉上。¤However, this person is proficient in stealth, and it is difficult for a while... I have heard for a long time that {FirstName}{$NickName} is superior in combat power.
公孙府向来只产上中下三品盈手露，不知{FirstName}道友从何听说极品一说？¤Gongsun's mansion has always only produced the upper, middle and lower grades, and I don't know how fellow Daoist {FirstName} heard about the best one?
戮仙剑落入魔门手中，宁州恐生大变......¤Immortal Executing Sword falls into the hands of the Demon Sect, and Ning Province fears major changes...
不好意思，宗门中还有许多待处理的事宜，道友请自便。¤Sorry, there are still a lot of issues to be dealt with in the sect, please feel free to do it yourself.
长老请二位前去。¤Elder, please go forward.
我是小姐还是你是小姐，居然过问起我来了？¤Am I a young lady or are you a young lady, did you ask me about it?
别贫了你。¤Don't make you poor.
马上就要去长老堂了，记住等下{color=#d0380a}千万不要说错话{/color}。¤I’m going to the Presbyterian Church soon, remember to wait {color=#d0380a}Don’t say anything wrong{/color}.
去禀报长老我回来了。¤Report to the elder that I am back.
是小的僭越了，二小姐稍等，我这便去通报。¤It's a little trespass. The second lady waits a moment, and I'll report it.
过会儿我说什么是什么，你顺着我的话演就成了。¤After a while, what I say is what, you just follow my words and act.
林沐心白了你一眼。¤Lin Mu gave you a blank look.
遵命，林二小姐。¤Yes, Miss Lin Er.
好的二小姐，这位是......？¤Okay second lady, this is...?
如今除了这头伤人的妖兽，这附近也该恢复太平了吧。¤Except for the beast that wounded people, peace should be restored here too.
你落荒而逃，这才保住一条性命。¤You ran away and saved a life.
师兄这边进展如何？¤How is it going on your side?
抱歉，让你提起这个。¤Sorry to bring this up.
因为是同族，有些感同身受吧。¤I think I can relate to it because I am of the same ethnic group.
这边凤火涅槃阵即将启动。师尊的第八劫也要开始了，麟庙要封闭20年，恕不远送还请见谅。¤The Phoenix Fire Nirvana Formation is about to be activated here. The eighth tribulation of the Master will also begin, and the Lin Temple will be closed for 20 years, so please forgive me for not seeing you off.
你将所见所闻，告知钟焰。¤You will tell Zhong Yan what you have seen and heard.
此事宗门内部已安排妥当。由你我二人先行查探以接应宗门后续弟子。¤Arrangements have been made within the clan for this. You and I will be the first to investigate in order to receive the followers of the clan.
这次{shidi}你暗中探查没有打草惊蛇。¤This time {shidi} you didn't spook the snake by scouting in secret.
{shidi}是想知道，我为何对这豹麟兽如此执着么？¤Is {shidi} wondering why I'm so obsessed with this leopard lion beast?
据我后续探知，玄古门已覆灭于内乱。¤According to my follow-up, the Profound Ancient Sect was destroyed by civil unrest.
我这边也是进展不错。¤It's going well on my end too.
既然麟尊大人已经开始疗伤了，那我这就告辞了。¤Since Lord Lin Zun has already begun to heal, I will take my leave now.
多谢{shidi}。¤Thanks {shidi}.
嗯...{shidi}路上小心。¤Um... {shidi}Take care on the road.
（没想到竟还有这段隐秘。）¤(I had no idea there was such a secret.)
师兄，若无吩咐我就出发了？¤Brother, if I have no orders I shall depart?
可以的话，把他带回来见我吧。¤Bring him back to me, if you can.
（此人竟然是妖族么，我竟然全然没有发现。）¤(Is this person actually a demon? I can't believe I didn't notice it at all.)
这次外门弟子有五十人深种魔神蛊之外，内门弟子仅有两人。¤This time, outside of the outer disciples, there were fifty people who were deeply planted with the Demon God Compulsion, and only two inner disciples.
你将所见所闻一一告知。¤You tell us everything you see and hear.
好¤Alright.
这两件宝物你且收好。¤These two treasures are yours to keep.
哪有，这一次仅仅是我个人委托。¤No, this time it was just a personal commission from me.
好的，钟师兄。¤Okay, Brother Zhong.
客气了。¤Be polite.
...嗯..辛苦{shidi}了，这古神教果然对我门贼心不死。¤... Well... After all the hard work {shidi} has done, this Ancient God Sect really has a thief's heart for our sect.
我还没有五品妖丹¤I don't have a fifth grade demon core yet
{FirstName}{shidi}来得好快。¤{FirstName}{shidi} came so quickly.
钟焰没有理会面露震惊的你，继续往下说。¤Ignoring the shocked faces of you, Bellflame continues.
这剑本就是随手之作，{shidi}你就留着吧，等以后再为{shidi}做个更好的。¤This sword is meant to be a casual piece, {shidi} you can keep it and make a better one for {shidi} later.
{shidi}可听说过豹麟兽？¤{shidi} Ever heard of the Leopard-Lin Beast?
说罢两件法宝从他的储物袋飞出。¤With that said two magic treasures flew out of his storage pouch.
{shidi}言重了，反倒是我想的不周险些让你深入险境。¤{shidi} I'm sorry, but it's my thoughtlessness that nearly put you in danger.
你感受到地底一阵剧烈的能量，炙热的火之灵力好似连空气都点燃了。¤You feel a violent burst of energy under the earth, and the searing spiritual energy of fire seems to ignite even the air.
钟师兄，有事但说无妨。¤Brother Zhong, if you have something to say, just say it.
豹麟兽一族乃是含有麒麟血脉的异兽，近沃焦山中似是有其踪迹，我想要拜托{shidi}调查一番。¤The Leopard-Lin Beast tribe is a foreign beast containing the bloodline of the Qilin, and there seems to be traces of it in the near Wau Jiao Mountain, so I would like to ask {shidi} to investigate it.
（一只妖兽需要如此重视么，不过看他的样子似是另有隐情，这沃焦山之行还是速速动身吧。）¤(Does a Spirit Beast need this much attention? But it looks like he's hiding something else, so let's get going on this trip to Mount Wogao.)
家师所需的灵物我已找时间凑齐了。¤I have found time to gather the spiritual items needed by the Master of the House.
我这边要先暗地里对这些深种蛊虫的弟子一一处理，等处理完此事。我们就去巫山走一趟，看看这古月寨是否已经是我宁州眼皮子底下的魔窟。¤On my side, I will first secretly deal with each and every one of these deeply planted compulsion disciples, and when we are done with this matter. We will then take a trip to Wushan Mountain to see if this Ancient Moon Cottage is already a devil's cave under the nose of my Ning Province.
{shidi}路上小心。¤{shidi}Take care on the road.
{shidi}还请快快行事。¤{shidi}Please also act quickly.
此{shidi}深入虎穴，这两枚焚天火玉是我个人收藏还请收下。\n¤This {shidi} is deep into the tiger's den, these two Burning Heaven Fire Jades are from my personal collection please accept them. \n
如果不是师傅现在我应该已经是冢中枯骨了吧。¤If it weren't for the Master I would be a dead bone in the grave by now.
嗯，这售卖丹药的长老竟然还有这等手段，看来这玄古门和古神教颇有瓜葛。¤Well, this elder selling pills actually has such tactics, it seems that this Profound Ancient Sect and the Ancient God Sect are quite involved.
这是我个人的一个请求，{shidi}若是不方便就不麻烦了。¤This is a personal request, {shidi} I won't bother if it's not convenient.
多谢{shidi}帮忙收集这些木系灵物。¤Thanks {shidi} for helping to collect these wood spirits.
最近诸事繁多我抽不开身，多亏了你奔波劳碌。¤I've had a lot on my plate lately, thanks to your hard work.
当前进度：（{$TempValue}/30）¤Current progress: ({$TempValue}/30)
若是唐突了，就当我没问过吧。¤If I'm being abrupt, just forget I asked.
此事宗门内部还没有安排妥当。¤This matter has not yet been properly arranged within the clan.
我还没有六品妖丹¤I don't have a Sixth Grade Demon Pill yet
眼前的钟焰眉头紧皱，似是心事重重。¤In front of him, Zhong Yan's brow was furrowed, as if he was preoccupied.
我还没有梧桐木¤I don't have any sycamore wood yet
庆幸的是宗门金丹长老无人中招。¤Thankfully none of the clan's Golden Dan elders were hit.
（同族？）¤(homologous?)
（表情略显无奈）{shidi}以后还会见到他的。¤(slightly bemused expression) {shidi} I'll see him again later.
说罢钟焰停顿了一下，面露追忆之色。¤After saying this Zhong Yan paused for a moment with a retrospective look on his face.
没关系，还是我唐突了，此时我再想想办法。¤It's okay, or I'm just being abrupt, I'll think of something else at this point.
当年我也是在追捕之下走投无路，所幸遇到了正在游历的师傅。¤Back then, I was also desperate under a chase and was fortunate to meet my master who was travelling.
你示意他继续。¤You gesture for him to continue.
道友，您是来我天机阁寻开心的吗？¤Friends, did you come to my Heavens Secrets Pavilion to have fun?
龙皇果乃是化龙海的特产，恕我宁州天机阁无力寻找。¤The Sovereign Drakefruit is a specialty of Dragonborn Sea. Forgive me for the Heavenly Divination Pavilion's inability to find it.

道友想要调查那个金属还是矿石？¤Do you want to investigate that metal or ore?
黒天麻乃是幽冥海域的特产，恕我宁州天机阁无力寻找。¤Black Gastrodia is a special product of Deep Hell Sea. Forgive me that the Heavenly Divination Pavilion is unable to find it.
这{SayStcVal=1012}情报，道友需要花费{$temmoney}灵石。¤This {SayStcVal=1012} intelligence, fellow Taoists need to spend {$temmoney} spirit stones.
绝魂草乃是阴冥海域的特产，恕我宁州天机阁无力寻找。¤The Fellsoul Lily is a specialty of the Deep Yin Sea. Forgive me for the Heavenly Divination Pavilion's inability to find it.

我还没有那么多灵石。¤I don't have that many spirit stones yet.
化神期妖圣岂是我天机阁敢去招惹的？¤Why is my Heavenly Secret Pavilion daring to provoke the Demon Saint of the Deity Transformation Period?
道友，气息有些陌生啊？¤Friends of Taoism, the breath is a bit strange?
喂~可不可以啊，不可以的话灵石我也够。¤Hey~ Can I? If not, I have enough spirit stones.
这可是六品梧桐木，传闻这可是神兽凤凰的伴生之物。道友若是看上，只要两枚黄泉再生丹或是修髓丹便换予道友。¤This is a sixth-grade paulownia wood, which is rumoured to be the companion of the divine beast Phoenix. If you like it, you can exchange it for two Yellow Spring Regeneration Pills or Marrow Cultivation Pills.
道友是看上了么？¤Do you have your eye on it?
这血菩提虽不说天地罕见，但一次拿出这么多也是惊人了。¤Although this Blood Bodhi is not said to be rare in heaven and earth, taking out so much at once is astonishing.
他换完转身离开，不过你注意到有人不怀好意的跟上了。¤He turns to leave after the change, but you notice that someone is unsuspectingly following.
嗯？哦，没问题！没问题！此物便是道友的了！¤Hmm? Oh, no problem! No problem! This is yours!
呦~这东西有点意思。¤Yo~ this stuff is kind of interesting.
一道矮小的人影从后方挤出来。¤A short figure squeezed out from the rear.
血菩提？！这么多？¤Blood linden? So much?
这本就是一截根须，但若是手法得当，说不定也能焕发生机。若不是迫不得已，我才不会出售呢。¤It's just a root, but if done right, it might come to life. I wouldn't sell it if I didn't have to.
此人明显不简单，也不知道谁是猎物。¤This man is clearly not simple and there is no telling who is the prey.
呵呵，一截枯死的老树根也能吹得天花乱坠，若真是六品材料你又岂能置换这点东西？¤If it were a sixth-grade material, would you be able to exchange it for this?
黄泉再生丹和修髓丹我都没带，不过这个你看可以么？¤I don't have either the Yellow Spring Regeneration Pill or the Marrow Cultivation Pill with me, but does this look okay to you?
呼~~好险好险，我还是先走为妙。¤Phew~~ so close, I'd better go first.
没想到这幻象居然如此厉害...¤I didn't expect this illusion to be so powerful...
通过了幻象的考验，你的{color=#d0380a}心境{/color}提升了。¤After passing this stage of the illusion, your {color=#d0380a}mental state{/color} has improved.
你继续在幻阵中坚持，上百个幻象在你周围游荡，突然，又一个幻象向你扑了过来...¤You continue to persist in the illusion. Hundreds of illusions are wandering around you. Suddenly, another illusion rushes towards you...
鲲角？怎么会出现在岛上？！等等，那我们站的地方岂不是？¤Kun horn? How could it be on the island? ! Wait, isn't that where we're standing?
依我看，这压根就不是什么山峰，而是鲲的角。¤In my opinion, this is not a mountain at all, but the horn of Kun.
但天地万物循环各有其道，自古以来反哺这片海域的，想来便是这鲲尸了。¤But everything in the world has its own way. Since ancient times, it has been the Kun corpse who has fed back this sea area.
奇怪...¤strangeness...
你老就别打哑谜了，难道说什么呀？¤Don't play dumb riddles anymore, what are you talking about?
老头，你有没有发现这个岛的灵气比其他岛浓郁几分，树木也茂密的多？¤Old man, have you noticed that the aura of this island is a bit richer than other islands, and the trees are much denser?
没错，这座岛恐怕就是鲲的尸身演化而来的。¤That's right, this island probably evolved from Kun's corpse.
别慌，你且看前面这个山峰，有没有想到什么？¤Don't panic, look at the mountain in front of you, did you think of anything?
鲲族吞噬天地万物灵气，在海上几乎没有天敌，若没有补充的话，这里早就变成一片死海了。¤The Kun clan devoured the spiritual energy of all things in the world, and there were almost no natural enemies at sea. If there was no supplement, this place would have long since become a dead sea.
你不说我还没注意，这山峰怎么这般工整，简直像是出自匠人之手。¤If you don't say I haven't noticed yet, why is this mountain so neat, it seems like it came from the hands of a craftsman.
竟然还有这层关系，当真是长见识了...¤It's really a long experience to have such a relationship...
确实，这……难道说……？¤Indeed, this... Could it be that...?
她与宁州古迹中那些被煞气附体的人情况有些相似，只是没有攻击性，也许我该从这方面考虑用什么丹药。¤She is somewhat similar to the situation of those people who are possessed by the Furies in the Ning Province monuments, except that they are not aggressive, so maybe I should consider what Pill to use from this aspect.
{xiaozi}，你看仔细了。她可不是简单的不想理你。¤{xiaozi}, you look carefully. She doesn't simply not want to care about you.
（也许我可以尝试一下用丹药治疗她。）¤（Maybe I can try to cure her with a potion.）
碎星商会的人不是说了神识类丹药没有效果，你这{xiaozi}怎么还给她这类丹药。¤The people of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild did not say that the divine consciousness type of Pill has no effect, how do you this {xiaozi} give her back this type of Pill.
你用灵力将丹药送入她口中。¤You use your spiritual power to deliver the Pill into her mouth.
听说你遇到过图南漩涡？¤I heard that you have encountered the South Tu Whirlpool?
你能感觉到她的眼神相比之前灵动了几分，但还是一副神智不清的样子。¤You can feel that her eyes are a few points more spiritual compared to before, but still a look of delirium.
他沉默着看了你半刻后，倏地站起，一手捏法诀，一手成爪型，挥爪间灵气急速聚集，便已是向你展开攻势。¤He looked at you in silence for half a moment, then abruptly stood up, one hand squeezed magic, one hand into a claw shape, waving claws between the rapid gathering of aura, it is already to you to attack.
他的状态并没有同你预料的一般有所变化。不，也许这才是你预料中的状况。¤His state has not changed as you would expect. No, maybe this is the situation you expected.
你有去过图南海么？¤Have you ever been to the Tunan Sea?
（看来只有到漩涡才能揭开真相了，至少我们现在知道前往漩涡前需提升{color=#d0380a}心境{/color}，可以提前准备一番了。）¤（It seems that only to the vortex to reveal the truth, at least we now know that before going to the vortex need to enhance {color=#d0380a} state of mind {/color}, you can prepare in advance some.）
我...终于还是把他们杀了么...¤I... Did you finally kill them after all...
她又变得激动起来。你估摸着也不能问出来更多信息了，心想着不如就此离开，剩下的交给碎星商会自己处理了。¤She became excited again. You reckon you can't ask out any more information, thinking that you might as well leave this and leave the rest to the Shattered Star Merchant Guild itself.
看样子要是想从她这里打听出什么的话，只能先想办法治愈她了。¤It seems that if you want to find out anything from her, you can only find a way to cure her first.
不！他们都是我杀的！不是妖物！¤No! I killed them all! Not demon creatures!
好在她陷入异常太久，战力远不如初，仅过数招之后便已被你擒下，甚至都没对客栈造成什么损失。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're getting into.
道友何故对我动手？¤Why did you make a move against me?
道友口中的他们可是漩涡中的妖物？¤Are they the demon creatures in the vortex that you are talking about?
（可能是幻境，她们一群元婴修士全部或者是有多人进入了漩涡内部。然后因为其它什么缘由，一同陷入了幻境，而她作为其中的最强者，活了下来。）¤（It may be an illusion that all or more than one of their group of YuanYing cultivators entered the inside of the vortex. Then for some other reason, fell into the illusion together, and she, as the strongest of them, survived.）
不如再回碎星商会问问。¤Why not go back to the Shattered Star Merchant Guild and ask.
他们？道友说的他们是谁？¤They? Who are they that you are talking about?
道友，我想打听一下，不知你可有时间？¤Daoist friend, I would like to inquire, I wonder if you have time?
你...不是他们...他们...去哪了...¤You... It's not them... They... Where did they go...
可惜我没有更多了。¤Unfortunately, I don't have any more.
（只是不知道她是怎么出来的，之后的百余年又发生了什么，为什么她一直表现出浑浑噩噩的状态。若不是诛仙剑在你这{xiaozi}身上，我甚至觉得她真是被煞气附体失了神志。）¤(I just don't know how she got out, what happened in the hundred years or so after that, and why she keeps acting all muddled up. If it weren't for the fact that the Immortal Punishing Sword is in your {xiaozi} possession, I'd even think she's really possessed by a fatal energy and lost her mind.)
...，感谢道友相助，但我在幻境中与故友战斗了百余年，现在...有些乏了...道友若想交流一番还是以后吧。¤... I thank you for your help, but I have been fighting with my late friend in the illusionary realm for over a hundred years, and now... I'm a little tired... If you want to exchange some or later.
（看来这人不太好沟通，还是去找其他人吧。）¤（It seems that this person is not very communicative, so let's go find someone else.）
（看来她口中的“他们”并不是漩涡中的妖物，而更可能是一起前往图南漩涡探索的其他修士。而且不知在漩涡里发生了什么，结果是她击杀了其他修士。）¤（It seems that the ''they'' she mentioned are not the monsters in the South Tu Whirlpool, but more likely other cultivators who went to explore the Whirlpool together. I don't know what happened in the Whirlpool, but the result is that she killed the other cultivators.）
在你的期待中，他缓缓转过头来。¤In your anticipation, he slowly turns his head.
唔，她看起来是神魂受损，看样子是在漩涡中遭遇了什么，正处于一种浑浑噩噩的状态。¤Well, she looks like her soul is damaged, it looks like she encountered something in the vortex and is in a muddled state.
这位{gongzi}，要参加下一次的拍卖会么？入场费只要1000灵石噢~¤This {gongzi}, do you want to participate in the next auction? The entrance fee is only 1,000 spirit stones~
按照惯例，在拍卖成功后，我们还会收取您成交价的10%作为抽水。不过若是物品流拍，就不会再另外收取费用了。¤According to the usual practice, after the auction is successful, we will also charge you 10% of the transaction price as a margin. However, if the item fails to auction, no additional fees will be charged.
前辈，这是我们拍卖行的传音符印记，日后前辈若是想知道最新的拍品情况，直接用{color=#d0380a}传音符{/color}与我们联系便可。¤This is our auction house's voice talisman seal, if you want to know the latest auction items in the future, directly use {color=#d0380a} voice talisman {/color} to contact us.
为了保证拍卖会的质量，我们会请专门的鉴定师对拍品进行鉴定。因此，所有价值低于10000灵石的物品都是不允许在这里寄卖的。¤In order to ensure the quality of the auction, we will ask a special appraiser to appraise the lot. Therefore, all items with a value of less than 10,000 spirit stones are not allowed on consignment here.
没事别来烦我，一天到晚请安也不嫌烦得慌。不如多花些时间准备猎魔试炼，省得在天魔眼里落个身死道消的下场。¤It's okay, don't bother me, please be so annoying all day long. It's better to spend more time preparing for the demon hunting trial, so as not to end up dead in the eyes of the demon.
哼，三派之中唯有冰派独......算了，我与你说这些干什么，修炼如何了？¤Hmph, the only one among the three factions is the Ice faction...Forget it, what am I doing with you, how is your cultivation?
上次算你厉害，我们再来！¤You were good last time, we will come again!
老子现在心情不好，劝你你别来找不痛快。¤I'm in a bad mood now, I advise you not to come and find it unhappy.
是来协助药园守卫的外门{shidi}吗？¤Is it here to assist the outside gate {shidi} guarded by the medicine garden?
{shidi}你这前往药园吧。¤{shidi}You go to the pharmacy.
可是来协助药园守卫内门{shidi}？目前人手空缺，{shidi}的到来也是解了燃眉之急。¤But come to help the medicine garden guard the inner gate {shidi}? There is currently a shortage of manpower. The arrival of {shidi} also relieves the urgent need.
{shidi}你这前往药园吧。\n¤{shidi}Go to the medicine garden.\n
白鹿真人看起来心情不太好的样子，还是不要打扰他了...¤The real White Deer looks like he's not in a good mood, so it's better not to disturb him...
白鹿真人一言不发，不知在想些什么。¤The real White Deer did not say a word, not knowing what he was thinking.
今日来之前，我已下定决心。今日的比试无论胜负如何，我都准备辞去会长的职务，并退出长老会。¤Before I came today, I had already made up my mind. No matter how I win or lose today's competition, I am prepared to resign from my position as president and withdraw from the Elders' Council.
怎么会...怎么会这样...¤How could... How could it be like this...
哈哈哈，既然比试结束了，那么按照商会的规矩，之后便准备重新选举会长吧。¤Hahaha, since the competition is over, then according to the rules of the Merchant Guild, after that, prepare to re-elect the president.
你一剑刺穿了唐连峰的元婴。¤You pierced Tang Lianfeng's Nascent Soul with a sword.
会出现挑战本就是我的错，当年我冲击化神失败后修为大损，确实对于长老会疏于管理，这点我难辞其咎。¤The challenge is my fault, I failed to achieve Deity Transformation and lost my cultivation, so I am not responsible for the negligence of the Council of Elders.
也不尽然，按规矩，上一任会长主动辞去职务时，有指定下任人选的权力。会长指定的人选在长老会选举时也有很大的价值。¤Not exactly, according to the rules, the previous president has the power to designate the next candidate when he resigns from his position voluntarily. The candidate designated by the president also has great value during the Elders' Council election.
{vpunch=10,0.5}什么？？¤{vpunch=10,0.5}What?
...罢了，的确是你们技高一筹。¤... It's just that, indeed, you are skilled.
这混元仙体丹虽说可以提升突破化神的成功率，但只靠它却是远远不够的...{FirstName}供奉最好还是做足完全准备以后再尝试突破。¤Although this hybrid immortal body pill can enhance the success rate of breaking through the Deity Transformation, but only rely on it is far from enough... Guest Elder {FirstName}, it's better to be fully prepared before you try to break through.
细细想来我曾听说过此人的名号，似乎并不光彩...对于这样的人，最好不要与之为敌，但也不能过于信任。其中尺度，四海兄还得好好考量才是。¤I've heard of this person's name, and it doesn't seem to be honorable... For such a person, it is best not to be an enemy, but also can not be too trusting. One of the scales, the four seas brother still have to consider well is.
哎，没想到事情会变成这样。¤Hey, I didn't expect things to turn out like this.
哈哈哈，那是自然，我已经将丹药带来了。¤Hahaha, that's natural, I've already brought the Pill.
唐平，既然比试输了，那你们唐家提出的挑战自然作废，你可服气？¤Tang Ping, since you lost the competition, the challenge from your Tang family is null and void, are you convinced?
哼...我们唐家自然不会破坏商会的规矩，用不着你提醒。¤Humph... Our Tang family will not break the rules of the Merchant Guild, so you don't need to remind us.
多谢道友手下留情，我心服口服。¤Thank you for your mercy, I am convinced.
四海兄，如此实力的强者，我们商会定要好好拉拢，切莫与之为敌啊。¤Brother, with such strength our Merchant Guild must be smart, don't make them an enemy ah
咳咳...咳咳咳...¤Ahem... Cough cough...
哈哈哈哈，我果然没有看错人。¤Hahahahaha, I really didn't misjudge anyone.
看来这场比试什么都没能改变。¤It seems that nothing has changed in this competition.
不错，我建议立刻以传音符通知在各地的长老回南崖城，举办长老会议协商此事。¤Good, I suggest immediately using the voice transmission talisman to notify the elders in various places to return to South Cliff City and hold a meeting of elders to consult on this matter.
接下来这段时间，想必长老会还有诸多事情需要处理。这是我的传音符印记，{FirstName}供奉若是还有事找我，可以用传音符与我联系。¤During this next period of time, I think the Elders' Council will still have many things to deal with. This is my voice transmission talisman seal, Guest Elder {FirstName}, if there's still something you need, you can use the voice transmission talisman to contact me.
真了不起...单论这种擂台比试的话，长老会中恐怕也无一人是他的对手。¤That's amazing... If we talk about this kind of ring competition alone, I'm afraid that no one in the Elders' Council is his opponent.
你有些实力，可惜还不是我的对手。¤You have some strength, but unfortunately you are not yet my opponent.
会长，我并不认为如今商会内还有其它合适的人选，此事还是不要这么快下结论的好。¤President, I do not think there are other suitable candidates within the Merchant Guild today, the matter is still not so fast to draw conclusions.
抱歉，我没能打赢比试¤Sorry I didn't win the competition.
诸位稍安勿躁，听我说几句。¤All of you settle down for a moment and listen to me for a few words.
连峰！¤Lian Feng!
这些都是你们商会自己内部需要解决的事，我这个所谓的供奉就帮不上什么忙了。¤These are matters that need to be resolved within your own Merchant Guild, I can't help much with this so-called Guest Elder.
住...住手...我认输！¤Stop... Stop... I admit defeat!
按之前说好的，我打赢比试，你支付报酬。¤As agreed before, I win the competition and you pay.
这是我的传音符印记，{FirstName}供奉若是还有事找我，可以用传音符与我联系。¤This is my voice transmission talisman seal, Guest Elder {FirstName} if there is still something you need, you can use the voice transmission talisman to contact me.
罢了，那唐家后生确实了不起。恐怕这次长老会换选，他有很大的机会能够上位。¤It's just that the Tang family scion is indeed remarkable. I am afraid that this time the elders will change the election, he has a great chance to be able to ascend to the top.
不说这些了，接下来这段时间，想必长老会还有诸多事情需要处理。¤Let's not talk of this more, I'm sure the council of elders will have many things to deal with during this period.
认输吧，你数百年修成的元婴来之不易，我不杀你。¤Admit defeat, your centuries-old cultivation of the firstborn is not easy to come by, I will not kill you.
哈哈哈，吴四海，这就是你找来的帮手？¤Hahahaha, Wu Sihai, this is the helper you got?
连斩我两名祭血使，我来会会你！¤Cut my two blood sacrifice envoys, I will meet you!
不错，即便不需要第二味主药，至多不过浪费一株木灵三针花，却也不至于影响最后成丹。¤It is true that even if the second main herb is not needed, at most one Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower will be wasted, but it will not affect the final potion.
你是说，木灵三针花或许不仅要作为辅药，同时也要作为主药使用？¤Are you saying that the Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower should perhaps be used not only as a secondary medicine but also as the main medicine?
避劫丹？¤The Tribulation Avoidance Pill?
正是。不知{$TmpTalkString}有何见解？¤Exactly. I wonder what insight {$TmpTalkString} has?
依我看，应当以化神期妖兽的妖丹作为主药，以木灵三针花作为辅药。¤In my opinion, we should use the demon core of a Spirit Beast at the Deity Transformation stage as the main medicine and the Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower as a supplementary medicine.
原来如此...这样想来，无法确定属性的妖丹的确只能作为主药使用。¤So that's it... When you think about it this way, demon pills with undetermined attributes can indeed only be used as main medicines.
你们揭开丹炉，一阵浓郁的药香飘过，一颗通体浑圆的丹药光彩夺目的出现在了药鼎之内！¤You unveil the furnace, a strong fragrance of medicine drifts past, and a round pill appears in all its glory inside the pot!
不管怎么说，还是要多谢{$TmpTalkString}这几日的帮助，眼下确实是没有其它的思路了，且看日后是否能有新的发现吧。¤Anyway, I give thanks to {$TmpTalkString}'s help over the past few days, but I really don't have any other ideas at the moment, I'll see if I have new discoveries later.
我曾经还听说过有一种用来拖延天劫到来时间的避劫丹，又或是还有别的我们不了解的丹药也未可知。¤I have also heard of a pill that is used to delay the arrival of the heavenly tribulation, or perhaps there are other pills that we do not know about.
我倒是与{$TmpTalkString}有不同的想法。¤I do have a different idea to {$TmpTalkString}.
{$name}说干便干，当下就开始准备起炼丹需要的药材。¤{$name} said he would do it, and immediately began to prepare the herbs needed for the alchemy.
化神期妖兽的妖丹虽然难得，不过既然是用作主药，那么另换一种聚元药性的草药替代也是可行的。¤Although demon cores of Spirit Beasts at the Deity Transformation stage are rare, since they are used as the main medicine, it is feasible to replace them with another herb of coalescing medicinal properties.
以我们之间的交情，若有我能帮得上忙的地方，一定知无不言。¤Given our friendship, if there is anything I can do to help, I will do so.
待我整理优化完这避劫丹的丹方，就赠予道友！¤Once I've finished optimizing the recipe for this Pill of Tribulation Avoidance, I'll give it to you!
原来如此...不愧是{$TmpTalkString}，竟连这等失传多年的丹药都能炼制出来，实在厉害！¤I see... As expected of {$TmpTalkString}, he can even make such a long lost pill, it's really impressive!
这...{$TmpTalkString}是从何得到这避劫丹的炼制方式的？¤This... Where did {$TmpTalkString} get the way to make this avoidance pill?
化神期妖兽的妖丹属性各不相同，若是作为辅药使用，药性完全无法确定。但若作为主药使用，那无论是何属性妖丹，皆是聚元药性。¤The properties of demon cores of Deity Transformation stage Spirit Beasts vary, so if used as a supplementary medicine, the medicinal properties cannot be determined at all. But if used as the main medicine, then no matter what the attribute of the demon core is, all of them will be of a coalescing medicinal nature.
八日后...¤Eight days later...
你见状不再打扰他，独自离开了。¤You see this and decide to leave instead of bothering him.
既是要推敲丹方，这些损耗便是在所难免的。只是未能让这失传的古方重现天日，才是最可惜的。¤As the recipe was being refined, these losses were inevitable. But it is a pity that this lost recipe has not been revived.
咳...只是运气好恰巧炼制出来罢了...¤Ahem... It's just a matter of luck that it happened to be made...
而且坎水玄冰果与木灵三针花皆是性寒的草药，如此一来，只需再配上一味性热的六品草药作为药引，便可成丹了！¤Moreover, the Kanshui Xuan Bing Guo and the Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower are both cold herbs, so all that is needed is another hot sixth grade herb as a medicinal Pill, and the pill will be ready!
此前我曾在宁州古迹中得到过一份残缺的丹方，上面虽然未曾记录完整的丹方，却提到了有些丹药需要用到两种不同的主药进行炼制。¤Previously, I had obtained a fragmented recipe in the Ancient Ning Province Ruins, which, although not recorded in full, mentioned that some pills required the use of two different main medicines for their refinement.
原来如此...若是古籍的记载无误，那只需弄清到底以哪味药材为主药，哪位为辅药，再加一位药引调和其寒热，便能复原这丹方了。¤So that's it... If the ancient records are correct, then we only need to find out which herbs are the main herbs and which are the secondary herbs, and add a medicinal guide to reconcile the heat and cold, and then we can recover the formula.
怎么会这样...¤How did this happen...
总之...炼制这丹药需两味主药，一味聚元，一味生息，而辅药则需用到三份木灵三针花，再配以药引平衡寒热，便可成丹。¤In short... To make this Pill, two main herbs are needed, one to gather yuan and the other to generate breath, while the auxiliary herbs need to be three parts of wood spirit three needle flowers, and then a medicinal Pill to balance the cold and heat, and the Pill will be ready.
毕竟是失传的古方，的确有这种可能。¤After all, it is a lost ancient recipe, so it is indeed a possibility.
你们揭开丹炉，隐约有一阵淡淡的药香飘过。可惜丹药并没有被炼制成功，只在炉底形成了一层厚厚的药渣。¤You open the pill furnace and a faint fragrance of medicine wafts through. Unfortunately, the pill has not been successfully refined and only a thick layer of medicinal residue has formed at the bottom of the furnace.
不过古籍上本身就只说这是为了渡劫而准备的材料，却未曾明说是用来炼制化劫丹的...¤However, the ancient texts themselves only say that this is a material prepared for the ascension tribulation, but they do not explicitly say that it is used to refine the Pill of Tribulation Resistance...
只能如此了...¤Seems to be the only way...
或许是古籍有所遗漏，少了一味辅药...又或者这上面记载的本就是作者随意杜撰的。¤Perhaps there is an omission in the ancient text and a complementary herb is missing... Or perhaps what is written here is a random fabrication by the author.
原来你说的是避劫丹。¤So you're talking about the Tribulation Avoidance Pill.
{$TmpTalkString}来的正好，我这几日仔细推演这古方，正有许多的问题想与你探讨。¤{$TmpTalkString}It's good that you've come, I've been analyzing the ancient formula for the past few days and have many things I wish to discuss with you.
可惜的是，这本书中只提及了那名化神期修士为此收集了化神期妖兽的妖丹，以及六品草药木灵三针花，却未曾提及其具体的炼制方式。¤Unfortunately, the book only mentions that the Deity Transformation Stage cultivator collected the demon cores of Deity Transformation Stage Spirit Beasts for this purpose, as well as the sixth-grade herb Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower, but does not mention its specific refinement method.
不错，这是一种可以推迟天劫降临时间的丹药，正要用到木灵三针花炼制。但由于这丹药的副作用明显，因此已经失传多年了。¤Yes, this is a pill that can postpone the arrival of the heavenly tribulation, and it was about to be refined using the Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower. However, due to the obvious side effects of this Pill, it has been lost for many years.
产自极寒之地的坎水玄冰果似乎也是聚元药性，我在天机阁拍卖会上曾有幸拍得一枚。¤The Kansui Xuanbing fruit from the Land of Extreme Cold also seems to be of a coalescing medicinal nature, and I had the honour of winning one at the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion auction.
当下的另一难题是化神期妖兽的妖丹，寻常六品草药虽然稀有，但尚可寻得。这化神妖兽的妖丹却是不知从何寻来了...¤The other problem at hand is the demon cores of Spirit Beasts at the Deity Transformation stage. While sixth grade herbs are rare, they are still obtainable. The demon core of a Spirit Beast at the Deity Transformation stage however...
{$name}说干便干，当下就开始准备起炼丹需要的药材...¤{He started to prepare the herbs needed for the alchemy right away...
只是可惜了那些珍贵的六品草药...¤It's just a pity about those precious sixth grade herbs...
你步入白帝楼的地火房，只见{$name}正伏案而作，不知在写些什么。¤You step into the ground fire room of the White Emperor Pavillion, only to see {$name} hunched over a desk, writing something.
成功了！这...这应该就是避劫丹！¤It worked! This... This should be the Tribulation Avoidance Pill!
不过，按寻常药理推断，化劫丹属临战防御类的丹药，通常该是用御气药性的主药炼制才对。¤However, according to common medicinal principles, the Pill of Transformation is a defensive pill for battle, and should normally be made with the main pill of the imperial qi medicine.
{$TmpTalkString}说的不错，此事我也有些疑惑。¤{$TmpTalkString} brings up a good point, I'm also confused about this matter.
好，那就依{$TmpTalkString}所言，用这个配方尝试炼制一次吧。¤OK, so let's try to refine it once with this recipe as {$TmpTalkString} says.
依我看，应当以木灵三针花作为主药，以化神期妖兽的妖丹作为辅药。¤In my opinion, the Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower should be used as the main medicine and the demon core of a Spirit Beast at the Deity Transformation stage as a supplementary medicine.
这次真是多亏了{$TmpTalkString}的帮助，否则多半又是白忙活一场了。¤Thanks to the help of {$TmpTalkString} this time, otherwise it would have been a waste of time again.
哈哈哈，{$TmpTalkString}与我所想不谋而合。¤Hahaha, {$TmpTalkString} spoke my mind.
与渡劫相关的材料...莫非是那传闻中炼制方式早已失传的化劫丹？¤A material related to the tribulation... Could it be the long lost Pill of Tribulation Resistance?
不过...或许还有一种可能？¤But... Perhaps there is another possibility?
只有六品丹炉能够承受两种不同的主药间的药性冲突...但不管怎么说，值得一试。¤Only a sixth-grade dan furnace can withstand the clash of medicinal properties between two different main medicines... But in any case, it's worth a try.
等等...木灵三针花？¤Wait a minute... Wooden spirit three needle flower?
此前传音中与你提及的那本古籍，其实是不久前我在一个交易会中换得的。¤The ancient book that I mentioned to you in the previous transmission was actually something I traded for in a trade fair not long ago.
炉底还有一些药渣，看来只是辅药的数量放多了，与主药无关。¤There are still some residue at the bottom of the furnace, it seems that only the quantity of auxiliary medicine has been put in excess and it has nothing to do with the main medicine.
我也是如此猜测的，因此才抱着试一试的想法，从那人手中换得了这本古籍。¤I guessed as much, which is why I traded for the book, hoping to give it a try.
这本古籍原本只是记载了一些虚无缥缈的奇闻轶事，但其中居然提到了某位化神修士为了渡劫而准备的炼丹材料。¤This ancient book was originally just a record of some nebulous and strange anecdotes, but it actually mentioned the alchemical materials prepared by a certain Deity Transformation cultivator for the purpose of crossing the tribulation.
只有药渣，连废丹也未能炼成...说明我们推测的丹方完全是错误的。¤Only residue remains, not even a ruined pill was refined... This means our forumla hypothesis was entirely wrong.
{$TmpTalkString}，正如你所说，炼制这丹药需要同时用到两种不同的主药！¤{$TmpTalkString}, as you say, making this pill requires the use of two different primary medicines at the same time!
没想到真是这样...失传多年的丹方终于能够重现天日，也不枉你这些时日付出的心血啊。¤I can't believe it... The long-lost formula has finally reappeared in the light of day. Your hard work has not gone to waste.
我这便按{$TmpTalkString}所言，尝试炼制一番！¤I'm going to try and refine it just like {$TmpTalkString} said!
金虹剑派？¤Golden Rainbow Sword Sect?
我派与金虹剑派素来交好，两派合力举办宗门大比也已经是很多年来的一个传统了。虽然只是外门比试，但也事关宗门荣誉，各位长老对此都非常重视。¤Our faction and the Golden Rainbow Sword faction have always had a good relationship, and the two factions have joined forces to hold the Zongmen Grand Competition for many years. It has been a tradition for many years. Although it is only an external contest, it is also related to the honor of the Zongmen. All elders attach great importance to this .
凡是在大比中表现出色的，都可以获得一枚筑基丹作为奖励。¤Anyone who performs well in the competition can get a Jidan as a reward.
我很期待你在宗门大比上的表现。¤I look forward to your performance in the Zongmen Grand Competition.
还有一件重要的事情你须得记住，我派每隔三十年会与金虹剑派联袂举办宗门大比，所有炼气期的弟子皆可参加。¤There is one more important thing you have to remember. Every 30 years, I will hold a sect contest with the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect. All disciples in the Qi refining period can participate.
好了{shidi}，你入门的相关事项都已经处理完毕了。¤Alright {shidi}, everything related to your entry has been processed.
你在门派内的居所刚刚我已经派人打扫干净，宗门内的大部分地方你都可以随意走动，这是你的宗门道袍。¤I have just sent someone to clean up your residence in the sect. You can walk around most of the sect. This is your sect robe.
看来此物的灵气已然溃散。¤It seems that the aura of this thing has collapsed.
灿，{color=#d0380a}火{/color}...{color=#d0380a}山{/color}......到底想表达什么呢？¤Can, {color=#d0380a}Fire{/color}...{color=#d0380a}Mountain{/color}...what do you want to express?
你小心翼翼地想捡起玉简，但是在触碰到的时候玉简就消散了。¤You carefully try to pick up the jade slip, but the jade slip dissipates when you touch it.
路边草丛中似有一物隐隐发光，你上前探查，发现是一枚玉简。火红如焰的上等玉料不知因何散发出一股令人生厌的气息。你决定...\n¤There seems to be something faintly glowing in the grass on the roadside. You stepped forward and found it was a jade slip. The fiery red jade material exudes an unpleasant breath for some reason. You decide...\n
你小心翼翼地捡起玉简，仔细盘查后并没有发现那股气息的源头。一个潦草的“灿”字印于其上，让你百思不得其解。¤You picked up the jade slip carefully, and after careful investigation, you didn't find the source of the breath. A scribbled Can is printed on it, making you puzzled.
是名为“灿”的人遗失了玉简吗？又或者是一个谜题？¤Is it the person named Can who lost the jade slip? Or is it a puzzle?
恒如生性贪婪，所谓的师徒情分，不过是他为了达成目的所用的托词而已。¤Heng Ru is greedy by nature, the so-called master and disciple love is just a pretext he uses to achieve his goal.
此时，手持戮仙剑的玄骨真人也完成了术法，戮仙剑在他手中嗡嗡地轻鸣着。你感受到背后铁剑呼应般的震动，一刻也不敢放松神经，小心地盯着对方的举动。¤At this time, the Xuan Bone True Man holding the Immortal Executing Sword also completed the spell, and the Immortal Slaughter Sword buzzed softly in his hand. You feel the vibration of the iron sword behind you, and you dare not relax your nerves for a moment, and stare carefully. Follow the other's actions.
你攻势凌厉迅猛，恒如真人很快便呈出落败的迹象。而手持戮仙剑的大护法的蓄势也进入尾声，戮仙剑在他手中嗡嗡地轻鸣着。¤You attacked harshly and swiftly, and Heng Ru Real soon showed signs of defeat. The Great Guardian, who was holding the Immortal Executing Sword, was also at the end of his momentum, and the Killing Fairy Sword was buzzing in his hand.
虽然恒如生性贪婪，但毕竟师徒一场，也教过你不少东西。到真要下手时，你却是迟疑了。¤Although Heng Ru is greedy by nature, but after all, teacher and disciple a, also taught you a lot of things. The actual time to get down to it, you are hesitant.
战后，大护法戮仙剑的蓄势也进入尾声，局势依然刻不容缓。¤After the war, the Great Guardian Immortal Executing Sword also entered the end of charging, the situation is still urgent.
“罢了…看这战况，就算不杀他应该也活不久了，就任他自生自灭吧。”¤It's just...looking at this battle, even if we don't kill him, he should not live long, so let him live on his own.
只见倪旭欣凭空凝聚出数十把巨大的灵气飞剑，向恒如真人刺去。¤Ni XuXin condensed dozens of huge Qi swords out of thin air, releasing them toward Lord Eternal Harmony.
你便不再管他，随即观察起场上的形势。¤You then no longer care about him, and then observe the situation on the field.
哈哈哈，我的万剑诀终于练成了，再吃我一剑！¤Hahaha, my ten thousand swords tactics have finally been practiced, take me one more sword!
只见古神教护法高举戮仙剑，斩向身后的巨大石壁。猎猎破空声后巨大的轰鸣骤然响起，一股奇异的空间波动扩散至整个大殿。¤I saw the guardian of the ancient gods holding up the Immortal Executing Sword, slashing towards the huge stone wall behind him. A huge roar suddenly sounded after the hunting broke through the air, and a strange spatial fluctuation spread to the entire hall.
不得已之下，恒如只得调动更多的飞尘进行防御，周围的其它众人见此情形，也一起加紧了攻势。那恒如真人双拳难敌四手，很快便呈出落败的迹象。¤As a last resort, Eternal Harmony had to mobilize more dust particles for defense. The other people around stepped up the offensive together. Lord Eternal Harmony greatly outnumbered, soon began to show signs of defeat.
更何况战况万分危急，你当机立断，一掌震散恒如真人的元神。随即便观察起了场上的形势。¤Not to mention that the battle situation is extremely critical, you make a split-second decision and shake off Heng Ru Zhen's Yuan Shen with a palm. Immediately after that, you observed the situation on the field.
奄奄一息的恒如真人在你面前，生与死或许就在你的一念之间。¤With the dying Heng Ru Zhen Zhen in front of you, life and death may be at the tip of your tongue.
看剑！¤Look at the sword!
恒如随手操控起一团飞尘便想将飞剑拦下，谁知这些飞剑的威能竟远超他的想象，刚一接触就将他的尘盾击溃。¤Lord Eternal Harmony attempted to block the flying swords with a cloud of dust. However, the power of the swords far exceeded his expectations, and destroyed his earth shield with ease.
你感受到背后铁剑呼应般的震动，一掌震散恒如真人的元神，小心地盯着大护法的举动。¤You feel the resonating vibration of the iron sword behind you, and with a palm shaking away the genesis of Heng Ru Zhen, you carefully stare at the movements of the Great Guardian.
忽然间，你莫名期望他能向你求饶。只要他向你开口求饶了，纵然有一万个杀他的理由，你也可以留他一条生路。¤Suddenly, you inexplicably expect him to beg for mercy from you. As long as he opened his mouth to you and begged for mercy, even though there are 10,000 reasons to kill him, you can leave him alive.
但他仍旧躺在那里，奄奄一息。¤But he was still lying there, dying.
金虹剑派每年都会举办仙资大会，招收外门弟子。但门派对门下弟子的悟性要求极高，因此很少有人能够通过测试。¤Every year, the Radiant Sword Sect holds the Immortal Qualification Conference to recruit outer disciples. However, the sect requires a very high level of enlightenment from its disciples, so very few people are able to pass the test.
听说星河剑派每年会在宗门大殿设立测试，招收资质优上的女修士入门。若是想要修习水系功法，星河剑派定是不二之选。唉，可惜人家只收女修......¤I heard that the Celestial River Sword School would set up a test every year in the sect hall to recruit female cultivators with the best qualifications to join the school. If you want to practice water-based techniques, the Star River Sword School will be the best choice. It's a pity that they only accept female practitioners ......
传闻各大宗门又开始招收外门弟子了。可惜我资质平平，怕是没机会了……¤It is rumored that the major sects are beginning to recruit disciples from the outside the sects again. Unfortunately, my qualifications are mediocre, I'm afraid I will have no chance...
此去西方三百里，竹山宗便坐落在一片竹林幻海之中，连修仙者都会迷失其中。就算诚心入门，也要经过层层比试，成功者寥寥无几啊。¤Three hundred miles to the west, the Bamboo Mountain Sect is located in a sea of ​​illusionary bamboo forests, even Cultivators have been known to get lost in the forest. Those who sincerely wish to enter, will have to go through a series of trials, the number of people who have succeeded can be counted on one hand.
只要踏入那沃焦山，你便明白离火门为何以火为名。其整个山门更是通体赤红，浮空于沃焦山之上。若是想精修火系，这或许是最理想的宗门。¤The moment you step onto Inferno Mountain, you will understand the Fire in Heavenly Fire Gate's name. The entire sect floating above Inferno Mountain is crimson red. If you want to master the art of fire, this will be your ideal sect.
化尘教位于宁州西侧的沙漠中，是五大门派之一。其教弟子擅用土系灵气，防御力远胜同阶修士。道友若是对防御方面的神通感兴趣，那化尘教自然最适合你。不过近几年化尘教一直闭门谢客，似乎是门派中发生了什么变故。¤Shifting Sands School is located in the desert on the west side of Ning Province. It is one of the five main sects. Its disciples are good at using Earth QI, and their defense is far better than cultivators of the same rank. If a Daoist is interested in defensive magic spells, then Shifting Sands would naturally suit them best. However, in recent years, the school has closed themselves off to outside guests, it seems that something mght have happened in the school.
9010，岛屿修士争斗（主线）¤9010, Battle of the Island cultivators (Main Line)
无尽之海上有着许多的灵气乱流，心志不够坚定者会在其中迷失自我。它不似凶兽或敌手的攻击那般引人注目，所以常被修士忽视。¤There is a lot of spiritual turbulence in the endless sea, and those who are not determined enough will lose themselves in it. It is not as eye-catching as the attack of the beast or the enemy, so it is often ignored by the cultivators.
你将那修士败于剑下，采摘了成熟的草药后转身离开此地。¤You defeated the cultivator by the sword, picked mature herbs and turned and left here.
你哪里想得到阵法内的修士手段如此厉害，急忙施展遁术逃出生天。¤Where do you want the cultivators in the formation to be so powerful, you hurriedly used the escape technique to escape to life.
还有什么需要的么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Is there anything else I need? {w}{w=0.5}
卖给商会自然是方便，但这些寻常的材料商会也不愿意出太高的价钱。¤It is naturally convenient to sell to the Merchant Guild, but these ordinary materials chambers are not willing to pay too high a price.
精细海图倒是没有，不过我对这附近的海域倒还算熟悉。¤There is no fine chart, but I am quite familiar with the seas around here.
（身上的钱似乎不够了...）¤(There seems to be not enough money...)
你若是愿意出上100灵石，我便帮你把附近海岛的位置都标记出来。¤If you are willing to put up 100 spirit stones, I will help you mark the locations of the nearby islands.
一个普通的摊位，上面摆放的都是些杂七杂八的物件，摆摊者看起来只是一个普通的散修，你决定...？{w}{w=0.5}¤An ordinary stall is filled with sloppy objects. The stallholder looks like an ordinary independent cultivator. You decide...?{w}{w=0.5}
道友，看看有什么想买的？{w}{w=0.5}¤Friends, see what you want to buy? {w}{w=0.5}
像我们这种独来独往的散修，是很难有那种机缘的。¤It's hard to have that kind of opportunity for independent cultivators like us.
至于他们愿意高价收购的稀有材料，无一不是要去危险海域才能弄到的东西，或是海上压根没有的稀有物件。¤As for the rare materials they are willing to purchase at a high price, they are all things that can only be obtained by going to dangerous seas, or rare things that are simply not available at sea.
你察觉她的气息波动颇为诡异，但却说不出其中的门道。¤You perceive her aura fluctuating quite strangely, but you can't tell why.
她冷漠地看了你一眼，并没有理睬你的搭讪。¤She glanced at you indifferently, and ignored your strike-up.
按常理来讲，修士的修为愈高，神魂则愈凝练。可我观此人灵力浑厚，已有金丹巅峰修为，魂魄不凝反散，聚合中隐有割裂之相。¤According to common sense, the higher the cultivation level of a cultivator, the more condensed the soul. But I think that this person has strong spiritual power, has the golden core peak cultivation level, and the soul is not condensed but scattered, and there is a fragmentation in the aggregation.
奇怪...奇怪..¤Weird... weird...
很明显魏无极也感受到了这份异样，并追溯出其源头或许是此人修练的功法。¤Obviously, Wei Wuji also felt this strangeness, and traced back to its source, perhaps the practice of this person.
不错，但具体情况我也很难定论。¤Yes, but it's hard for me to conclude on the specific situation.
也就是说，这修士的神魂并不稳定？¤In other words, the spirit of this cultivator is not stable?
此人气息倒是与上次见到的那人有些相似，也不知这些人练得是何秘术...¤This breath is somewhat similar to the person I saw last time, and I don't know what secret skills these people have practiced...
魔门竟有如此计划...不好意思，道友，我还要和族中商议此事。¤The Demon Sect has such a plan... I'm sorry, fellow Taoist, I still have to discuss this with the clan.
魔门未免太目中无人...如此狂妄之徒......！¤The magic door is too arrogant... such an arrogant...!
而洞穴正中，一只巨大的噬金甲正停驻于此，不知原本在啃噬着什么金属。兴许是听见你那并不存在的脚步声，它正对你怒目而视。¤In the middle of the cave, a huge gold-devouring armor was parked here, and it was unknown what metal it was eating. Perhaps hearing your non-existent footsteps glaring at you.
当你以为妖王不在，准备直接取走这暗槐玉时，那妖王不知从何处驱使藤蔓像你袭来。¤When you thought that the demon king was not there and was going to take this dark locust jade directly, the demon king drove the vines to attack like you from nowhere.
及至通道尽头，一只地龙兽赫然出现在你眼前。¤At the end of the passage, an earth dragon beast appeared before your eyes.
更是有一只通体布满黑鳞的粗壮墨蛟御涛向你袭来。¤There is even a sturdy ink Jiao Yutao with black scales all over its body attacking you.
但这能让作为金丹期修士的你都感到寒冷的洞穴中，也不知是有什么古怪，湖水竟没有结冰。¤But this can make you feel cold in the cave as a Jindan cultivator, and I don't know what is strange, the lake water did not freeze.
还好你辨认出眼前不过是一面藤蔓组成的绿墙，将其拨开后，谨慎地走入背后的巨大洞穴中。¤Fortunately, you recognized that there was just a green wall of vines in front of you, and after pushing it aside, you cautiously walked into the huge cave behind you.
你还未走至洞底，灼热燎人的火灵气已是令你不由得驱使灵气抵抗。¤You haven't walked to the bottom of the cave yet, the scorching fire aura has already caused you to force the aura to resist.
及至通道上都布满各类植物时，道路终于也是到了尽头。¤When the passage is covered with all kinds of plants, the road finally comes to an end.
而那{$NpcName}托你寻找的{$CaiLiaoName}正被他护在身后。¤And the {$CaiLiaoName} that {$NpcName} asked you to find is being guarded by him.
及至构成通道的岩石都隐约散发出金属光泽时，一个巨大的洞穴也猛地出现在你眼前。¤When the rocks that make up the passage are faintly metallic, a huge cave suddenly appears in front of you.
随着金灵气越来越浓郁，你所在的通道也愈加宽阔起来。¤As the golden aura becomes more and more concentrated, the passage you are in becomes wider and wider.
随着火灵气越来越浓郁，你所在的通道也愈加宽阔起来。¤As the fire aura becomes more and more intense, the passage you are in becomes wider and wider.
随着水灵气越来越浓郁，你所在的通道也愈加宽阔起来。¤As the water aura becomes more and more concentrated, the passage you are in becomes wider and wider.
只见昏暗的地下世界中，浓郁的木灵气从一块荧烁着幽绿光芒的玉状矿石中逸散而出。¤In the dim underground world, the rich wood aura escaped from a piece of jade-like ore glowing with a faint green light.
正是{$NpcName}托你寻找的暗槐玉！¤It is the dark locust jade that {$NpcName} asked you to find!
随着木灵气越来越浓郁，你所在的通道也愈加宽阔起来。¤As the wood aura becomes more and more intense, the passage you are in becomes wider and wider.
不等你犹豫，这噬金甲已是毫不犹豫地像你冲撞而来。\n¤Don't wait for you to hesitate, this gold-devouring armor is already charging like you without hesitation. \n
随他一同出现的，还有散发出赤红光芒的火系神通！¤Appearing with him, there is also a fire-type supernatural power that emits a crimson light!
辽阔的水域中心，一块蓝色的通透晶矿不断逸散着寒气。¤In the center of the vast waters, a blue transparent crystal ore kept escaping cold air.
正当你快得手时，却见原本了无波澜的湖泊竟是惊涛骤起！¤Just when you were about to succeed, you saw that the lake that had been without waves was actually a sudden surge!
你也不想一探究竟，只想驾驭法宝凌空掠过，直接取走那中心的通透晶矿。¤You don't want to find out, you just want to control the magic weapon to fly through the sky and directly take away the transparent crystal ore in the center.
当你来到通道的尽头时，却发现此处竟是地下湖泊。¤When you come to the end of the passage, you find that it is an underground lake.
再向前移动一段距离后，有一岩浆湖出现在前方。但还没等你细看，一只炙火蝎已是出现在你的视线内。¤After moving forward a certain distance, a lava lake appeared in front. But before you can take a closer look, a burning fire scorpion has already appeared in your sight.
我会替你断后，防止意外发生。不过我相信以{$daihao}你的实力，应当不需要我出手了吧。¤I will break the back for you to prevent accidents. But I believe that with {$daihao} your strength, there should be no need for me to step in.
{$daihao}...作为如今风雨楼中威名最盛的天字杀手，我希望你可以与我一起完成这件悬赏。¤{$daihao}... As the most prestigious Heavenly Assassin in the Rain or Shine Tower today, I hope you can work with me to complete this reward.
二百万灵石。¤Two million spirit stones.
按公孙季此前的说法，琚运琦与血剑宫有私下勾结。但他此时却邀请你一同暗杀血剑宫长老，令你颇为不解。¤According to Gongsun Ji's previous statement, Ju Yunqi had a private collusion with the Blood Sword Palace. However, he invited you to join him in assassinating the Blood Sword Palace elders at this time, which made you quite puzzled.
不太一样。¤Not quite the same.
这次悬赏的目标是此前在白帝楼参与夺剑的一名血剑宫元婴期长老。血剑尊盛名在外，即便在天阶悬赏中也颇为棘手。¤The target of this bounty was a Blood Sword Palace Genius stage elder who had previously participated in the sword snatching at the White Emperor's Tower. The Blood Sword Elder was well-known and was quite tricky even among the Heavenly Rank bounties.
一起？风雨楼内的悬赏，似乎没有这样的先例吧？¤Together? There doesn't seem to be a precedent for such a reward within the Wind and Rain Tower, does there?
何况，告诉白帝楼，那我们风雨楼赚什么？¤Besides, if we tell the White Emperor's House, what will we earn at the Rain or Shine House?
是大长老此前提到的特殊悬赏么？¤Is it the special reward that the Grand Elder mentioned earlier?
事关重大，我费了不少功夫才发现了那血剑宫长老的踪迹，此番务必一次成功，若是让他逃离了宁州，再想追上就麻烦了。¤It took a lot of effort to discover the trail of the Blood Sword Palace Elder, so I must succeed once and for all. If I let him escape from Ning Province, it will be a problem to catch up with him.
你若独自出手便能解决此人，这二百万灵石便归你一人所有。¤If you can solve this man by yourself, the two million spirit stones will be yours alone.
琚运琦略显惊讶的皱了皱眉...¤Ju Yunqi frowned in slight surprise...
{$daihao}，这次找你来是有一件悬赏想要交予你。这件悬赏难度不小，但报酬一定会让你满意。¤{$daihao}, I have come to you this time because I want to give you a reward. This reward is not difficult, but the reward will certainly satisfy you.
好，我先动身。你准备好后，尽快来九嶷山找我。¤OK, I will move first. When you are ready, come to Jiuyi Mountain to find me as soon as possible.
此事原本应先告知公孙季知晓，但为了避免琚运琦生疑，你只得先与他一同出发，再见机行事...¤You should have informed Gongsun Ji of this, but to avoid suspicion on Ju Yunqi's part, you had to go with him first and then see what happens...
越快越好，这血剑宫长老目前正藏匿于九嶷山一带。不如你我二人即刻动身，以免生变。¤The sooner the better. The Blood Sword Palace elders are currently hiding in the Jiuyi Mountain area. Why don't you and I set off immediately to avoid any changes?
你跟着玄女走进密室，琚运琦已经在这里等你了。¤You follow the Xuan Nui into the secret room where Ju Yunqi is already waiting for you.
何时动手？¤When will you do it?
追踪暗杀之术，非白帝楼所长。¤The art of tracking and assassination is not something that the White Emperor's House is known for.
眼前是一处深坑，源源不断死气四溢开来。¤In front of you is a deep pit, the source of death gas spilled out in all directions.
哈哈哈哈，不错不错，这样为师也可以放心将师门传承交给你了。¤Hahahaha, not bad, not bad. So as a teacher, I can finally pass on our school heritage to you.
可惜可惜...你这孩子还是差一些火候。¤It's a pity...you kid is still a little worse.
道友可听说过灵眼？无尽之海上有时会遇到天然形成的灵气汇聚之地，在其中修练的速度是平时的几倍。嗨，这也都是听别人提起的，我是没有运气遇见这种好事...¤Have you heard of the spiritual eye? The endless sea sometimes encounters a place where natural auras converge, where the speed of practice is several times faster than usual. Hey, this is also heard from others, I am No luck meeting such a good thing...
咳咳...没想到这方壶山这等凶险，先撤吧。¤Ahem... I didn't expect this danger like Fang Hushan, so let's get out first.
他这样说着，便化作一道血色遁光，飞也似的逃开了。¤When he said this, it turned into a bloody escape, and Fei fled away.
至于这储物袋...应该是被害者的遗物。等回广陵城后，便将此物交还给他的家人吧...¤As for this storage bag... It should be a relic of the victim. When we return to Guangling City, we will return this to his family...
这储物袋...应该是被害者的遗物。等回广陵城后，便将此物交还给他的家人吧...¤This storage bag... It should be a relic of the victim. When we return to Guangling City, we will return this to his family...
咳咳咳...我有伤在身，今日便放你一马。¤Cough cough cough... I have injuries, so I will let you go today.
虽然不太确定，但还是应该回白帝楼汇报一下。¤Not quite sure, but should report back to the White Emperor's House.
呼...好古怪的法门...不似寻常修士，倒是有点像魔门。¤Whew... What an odd dharma... Not like an ordinary cultivator, but a bit like a demon discipline.
先回白帝楼汇报吧。¤Let's report back to Baidi Building first.
听他们所说这豹麟兽已经落入他们之手。看来此行算是落空了。¤From what they had said, the Leopard Lin Beast had already fallen into their hands. It seems that this trip has been a bust.
没看出来，还是个高手。不过，我今天有急事，道友后会有期。¤I didn't see it coming, still a master. However, I have urgent business today, so I will see you later, fellow Daoist.
说罢，他一掐法诀，激活阵法。空间一阵波动之后，人就消失不见了。¤After saying this, he activated the formation with a pinch of the spell. After a fluctuation in space, the man disappeared.
此人也是果断，连同伴的尸身都不看一眼。¤This man was also decisive, not even looking at the corpse of his companion.
果然，这玄古门不简单啊。¤Sure enough, this Profound Ancient Sect is not simple.
天下奇门异术数不胜数也没什么好奇怪的，先收着吧。¤There are countless strange arts in the world and there is nothing strange about them, so take them for now.
唉，还是先回麟庙吧。¤Alas, it is better to go back to Lin Temple first.
没想到此地阵法除了敛息探查之效，竟还包有传送阵。¤I didn't expect that in addition to the effect of breath-holding and scouting, the formation here would also include a teleportation formation.
这不是玄谷丹吗？老头，你说此人应该就是玄古门的人吧。¤Isn't this Profound Ancient Dan? Old man, you said this person should be from the Profound Ancient Clan, right?
不过，以你在丹道上的造诣确实有看不出来什么。¤However, with your attainment in the Dan Dao there really is nothing to see.
此人身上只有一块碎裂的玉牌，一只黑色小瓶。玉牌虽已破碎，但依稀能看到上书“玄古”二字。¤This man only has a broken jade token and a small black vial. Although the jade tablet was broken, the word ''Profound Ancient'' could be vaguely seen on it.
怎么这丹药有什么问题？¤How come there is something wrong with this Pill?
怪事，以我的炼丹造诣竟是连这丹药所用材料和炼制手法都分不出来。¤It's strange that with my alchemy skills I can't even distinguish the ingredients and refining techniques used in this Pill.
打开小瓶，倒出一枚通体鲜红的丹药。¤Open the vial and pour out a bright red Pill.
先看看此地还有什么线索吧。¤Let's see what other clues there are in this area first.
此地阵法已在激活后自毁，倒也没什么收获。¤The formation in this area has destroyed itself after activation, so there is not much to gain.
即使不是，也八成和玄古门颇有瓜葛。¤Even if they are not, it is likely that they are quite involved with the Profound Ancient Sect.
不错，我现在的确奈何不了你。但别忘了，当年是薇儿救了你！若是没有我们血剑宫，哪有你凌轩的今日？¤Yes, it's true that I can't help you now. But don't forget, it was Wei'er who saved you back then! If it weren't for our Blood Sword Palace, how would you, Ling Xuan, be where you are today?
轩儿...¤Xuaner...
保重！¤Take care!
难道这是...天道树的力量？¤Could this be... The power of the Heavenly Dao Tree?
吼！恶饕老贼，是时候报这十万年前的仇了！¤Roar! It's time to take revenge for what happened 100,000 years ago, old evil gourmets!
像是有什么东西要从他的体内钻出来一般，他变异的身体突然扭曲起来，鼓起了大大小小的气泡。¤As if something was about to burst out of him, his mutated body suddenly twisted and bulged with large and small bubbles.
没有。¤None.
用你那柄剑...给我一个痛快吧。¤With that sword of yours... Give me a pain in the ass.
劫云渐渐散去，在那片天空之下，仿佛只有白帝一人。¤The robbery clouds gradually dispersed, and under that sky, it was as if the White Emperor was alone.
此时混元子、明山、白鹿似乎都已负伤，而恶饕单手接住了麒麟的火球，并借力快速向你飞来。¤At this point, Mixer, Ming Shan and White Deer all seem to have been wounded, while Evil Taou catches the fireball from the Qilin with one hand and uses the force to fly quickly towards you.
这剑中似留有一丝天道气息，在我渡劫失败之刻，雷劫中仙灵之气似乎恰巧引动了剑中的天道气息，我趁机运起了先前寻来的《造化逆天术》，重新凝聚了肉身。¤The sword seemed to have a trace of Heavenly Dao in it. At the moment I failed to cross the tribulation, the immortal spirit energy in the lightning tribulation seemed to have triggered the Heavenly Dao aura in the sword, and I took the opportunity to use the ''Creation Against Heaven Technique'' I had found earlier to reunite my physical body.
血亢...¤Hyperemia...
红莲，魔剑已毁，留在这里已经没有意义了。白帝若是成功渡劫，可不会放过我们。¤Red Lotus, the magic sword has been destroyed, there is no point in staying here anymore. If the White Emperor succeeds in crossing the tribulation, he will not spare us.
走吧¤Let's go
御剑门因你而亡，还莫名背负了私通魔门的骂名。当年你设计陷害御剑门时，可曾想过今天？¤The Imperial Sword Sect died because of you, and you have inexplicably taken the blame for fornicating with the demons. When you set up the Imperial Sword Sect, did you ever think about today?
只见黑雾并未被白帝的护罩阻挡，径直钻入了白帝的丹田之处。¤The black fog was not blocked by Emperor Bai's shield, but drilled straight into his dantian.
红色的雷柱轰然落下，迎接它的是一柄巨大的青色灵剑。灵剑与雷柱接触的一瞬间，爆发出耀眼的闪光，翻涌的灵气四散开来，让人无法看清劫云中心到底发生了什么。¤The red pillar of thunder came down with a bang, and was greeted by a huge green-coloured spirit sword. The moment the spirit sword came into contact with the thunder pillar, a dazzling flash of light erupted and the surging aura spread out in all directions, making it impossible to see what was actually happening at the centre of the robbery cloud.
要打的话，本座也可以出手。这些古神教的杂碎，本座恨不得通通撕碎！¤If you want to fight, this throne can also make a move. These scum of the Ancient God Sect, I hate to tear them all apart!
玄骨的脸色顿时难看的起来，过了许久，才挤出一抹难看的笑容说道：¤Xuan Bone's face suddenly turned ugly, and only after a long time did he squeeze out an ugly smile and say.
哈哈哈哈哈...¤Hahahahahahaha...
转头看去，只见一道血色剑气瞬间横跨天空，直直刺进剑阵中，接着一声轰然炸响，灵气狂暴地四散开来，让人看不清其中发生了什么。¤Turning his head to look, he only saw a blood-coloured Sword Qi instantly spanning the sky and stabbing straight into the sword formation, followed by a booming explosion and the aura scattering wildly in all directions, making it impossible to see what was happening in it.
{size=31}这天地劫可不好应对，凌老儿你可要撑住啊...{/size}¤{size=31}This heaven and earth tribulation is not easy to deal with... {/size}You must hold on, Elder Ling... {/size}
{size=31}哈哈哈，我就知道凌老儿没问题的！{/size}¤{size=31}Hahahaha, I knew Ling Laoer would be fine! {/size}
{size=31}真是了不得，这一剑的威能即便是我...不，应该说在场的任何一人都绝无可能从这一剑下幸存{/size}¤{size=31}This sword is so powerful that even I... No, there is no way that anyone in this room could survive this sword {/size}
此事你大可放心，但是接下来你打算怎么办？¤You can rest assured of this, but what are you going to do next?
罢了...给我一个痛快吧。¤Just... Give me a pain in the ass.
兄长，今日我们只是为戮仙剑而来。如今魔剑已毁，再说这些又有何益。¤Brother, today we are only here for the Immortal Executing Sword. Now that the magic sword has been destroyed, what is the point of talking about it.
玄骨冷哼一声，张开领域便往后逃窜。但即便如此，他一人又如何能从你们六个人的包围下逃脱呢？¤Xuan Bone snorted coldly, opened his domain and fled backwards. But even so, how could he alone escape from the six of you surrounding him?
此时天边一道剑气划过，劫云又一次散开。¤At that moment a Sword Qi streaked across the sky and once again the robbery clouds dispersed.
带着你的人离开这里，我可以放你们一条生路。¤Take your people out of here and I will let you live.
那你此刻？¤And you at the moment?
而在一旁，血亢手握三柄魔剑浮空而立。¤And off to the side, Blood Hyper stands floating in the air with three demonic swords in his hands.
劫云渐渐散去，万道光柱穿破云层，洒在海面上。¤As the robbery clouds gradually dispersed, ten thousand pillars of light pierced through the clouds and spilled onto the sea.
虽说如此，当你退至众人身后，却发现四人的配合越发捉襟见肘起来。¤Granted, as you retreat behind the group, you find the four of you getting more and more stretched in tandem.
凝儿可不是一个人，你是想一个人对付我们那么多人么？¤Ning'er is not alone, are you trying to take on so many of us by yourself?
真是...后生可畏...¤What a... It's the new kid on the block...
但是...¤But...
白帝就站在那里，静静地看着血剑宫众人化作红色的遁光逐渐远去。¤The White Emperor just stood there, quietly watching the Blood Sword Palace crowd turn into red evanescent light and gradually move away.
{size=31}哈哈哈，难得松松筋骨，再多打你一个又何妨？{/size}¤{size=31}Hahahaha, what's the harm in beating you one more time when it's rare to loosen up? {/size}
你手持诛仙剑，拦在追来的魔门众化神身前。¤You hold the Immortal Punishing Sword, stopping in front of the multitude of the demon sect's Deity Transformation who are coming after you.
白帝并未作答，又回头看向你。¤The White Emperor does not reply, and turns back to you.
白帝猛然喷出一口鲜血。¤The White Emperor spurted out a violent mouthful of blood.
{$TmpTalkString}觉得怎么样？¤What do you think of {$TmpTalkString}?
在光柱的正中心，能够清晰的看到一个身影正缓缓向上飞去。但此时若有人用神识探查，却又绝无可能感应到任何东西。¤In the centre of the pillar of light, a figure can be clearly seen flying slowly upwards. But at this point, if someone were to use their soul sense to probe, they would never be able to sense anything.
嘁...¤Ch...
凌轩，你一点都没变，还是和当年一样自以为是的口吻。¤Ling Xuan, you haven't changed a bit, you still have the same smug tone as you did back then.
一道震耳欲聋的雷鸣声打破了你们的对峙，一块覆盖了整片海域的暗红色雷劫终于成型，无数鲜红色的电弧在劫云中若隐若现。¤A deafening thunderclap broke your confrontation as a dark red thunderclap covering the entire sea finally took shape, countless bright red arcs of lightning looming in the cloud.
血亢剑仙，按照约定，那柄绝仙剑该给我们天魔道，你不会不认账吧？¤Bloodthirsty Sword Immortal, according to the agreement, that Absolute Immortal Sword should be given to our Heavenly Demon Dao, you won't deny it, will you?
吼，受死吧！¤Roar, suffer death!
言罢，三人合力攻向恶饕，但兴许是三人的配合并不默契，又或是魔神蛊确实重创了白帝，在三人的攻伐之下，恶饕老祖并未落于下风。¤But perhaps it was because the three of them did not work well together, or because the Demon God Compulsion had indeed severely injured the White Emperor, and under the attack of the three of them, the Evil Taotou Old Man did not fall behind.
你闻言看去，只见白帝正闭目盘坐在半空之中，似是在调理自身。¤You look at the words and see that the White Emperor is sitting in mid-air with his eyes closed, seemingly toning himself.
一时间，剑芒大盛，恶饕老祖变异的躯体以肉眼可见的速度慢慢缩回了正常的样子。¤In a flash, the sword was so strong that the mutated body of the Evil Taotao Old Man slowly shrank back to its normal appearance at a speed visible to the naked eye.
只见黑雾并未被白帝的护罩阻挡，径直钻入了白帝的丹田之处。与此同时，在劫雷的打击下，灵气护罩明灭了数次但并未破开。¤The black mist was not blocked by Emperor Bai's shield and went straight into his dantian. At the same time, under the strike of the thunderbolt, the aura shield went off several times but did not break.
另外...今日我未能帮师傅重塑肉身...以后的事，唯有拜托你了。¤Besides... I was unable to help Master reshape his physical body today... The only thing I can do from now on is to ask you.
以你的修为，本不必走这些歪门邪道，所以现在也只不过是自食其果罢了。¤With your cultivation level, you didn't have to follow these crooked paths, so now you're just eating your own fruit.
你以为你能骗得过我么？¤Do you think you can fool me?
今日之事，多谢诸位道友鼎力相助。此番古神教元气大伤，魔剑也悉数被毁，想必短时间内魔门也不会再犯宁州。¤Thank you all for your help in today's incident. The Ancient Gods Sect has been greatly wounded and the Devil's Sword has been destroyed, so I believe that the Devil's Sect will not be invading Ning Province again anytime soon.
“轰隆”¤'Boom.''
够了。¤Enough is enough.
还真是有一手呢。¤It's quite a handful.
是最后一道天劫了¤It's the final cataclysm
重伤的恶饕老祖看了看众人，似乎想说些什么，却突然剧烈的咳嗽起来。¤The badly wounded Old Evil Taotao looked at the crowd and seemed to want to say something, but suddenly coughed violently.
恶饕老祖似乎想说些什么，却突然剧烈的咳嗽起来。¤It seemed that the evil gourmets' old ancestor wanted to say something, but suddenly coughed violently.
似乎是看出了你的颓势，白鹿一个闪身到了你的身前，又挡下了恶饕的一击。¤Seeming to see your decline, the white stag dodges to your side and blocks another blow from the evil gourmand.
师兄你……¤Brother you ......
伴随着一声叹息，一道血色剑气瞬间横跨天空，直直刺进剑阵中，接着一声轰然炸响，灵气狂暴地四散开来，让人看不清其中发生了什么。¤With a sigh, a blood-coloured Sword Qi instantly spanned the sky and stabbed straight into the sword formation, followed by a booming explosion and the aura scattered wildly in all directions, making it impossible to see what was happening in it.
恶饕给我种下的魔神蛊带来的伤势比我想象中的还要重。¤The demon god compulsion planted on me by the evil gourmets brought about more injuries than I could have imagined.
何况你们这些古神教的蛆虫留在世上也是祸害。不如，今日本宫先废了你的一身修为，再放你走如何？¤Besides, you maggots of the Ancient Gods Sect are a scourge to the world. Why don't I destroy your cultivation before letting you go?
白帝的声音在每个人的耳边淡淡响起，带着不容质疑的威严。¤The White Emperor's voice rang out faintly in everyone's ears, with an unquestionable majesty.
这些年来我也收集到了一些天才地宝，像这木灵三针花，地心淬灵乳还有堕山大圣的妖丹都是极为稀有的六品材料，想必诸位是识货的吧？¤Over the years I have also collected some genius treasures, like this Wood Spirit Three Needle Flower, the Earth Heart Quenching Spirit Milk and the Demon Pill of the Fallen Mountain Sage are all extremely rare sixth grade materials, so I'm sure you all know the goods, right?
说罢，他便将一柄魔剑抛向红莲。¤With that, he threw a magic sword at the red lotus.
师兄放心。¤Don't worry, senior.
星宫主可不是一个人，你是想一个人对付我们那么多人么？¤The Star Palace Master is not alone, are you trying to take on so many of us by yourself?
白帝并未多言，取走你手中的诛仙剑后又向恶饕攻去。¤The White Emperor did not say much, and after taking the Immortal Punishing Sword from your hand, he attacked the Evil Taotai again.
虽然{$TmpTalkString}同意放你走了，不过我星宫的仇可不能不报。¤Although {$TmpTalkString} has agreed to let you go, the revenge of my Star Palace cannot go unanswered though.
星宫主，你可不要欺人太甚了。¤Star Palace Master, don't bully people too much.
诛仙剑阵！起！¤The Immortal Sword Formation! Arise!
我后半生所做的一切，都是为了偿还当年在血剑宫犯下的罪孽。¤Everything I have done in the latter half of my life is to pay for the sins I committed in the Blood Sword Palace back then.
恶饕旧伤未愈，新伤又起，扭曲庞大且恐怖的肉体在巨大的剑影之下也显得脆弱不堪。¤The old wounds were not healed, but new ones were created, and the twisted, huge and terrifying flesh looked fragile under the huge shadow of the sword.
待到灵气平息下来，你再凝神看去，只看到剑阵已破，血亢手握三柄魔剑浮空而立。¤Once the aura has calmed down, you gaze again and see that the sword formation has broken, and that Bloodcoil stands floating in the air with three demonic swords in his hands.
雷光之中，白帝又举起了手中之剑，凝聚出一道浩大的剑形虚影，劈向恶饕。¤In the midst of the lightning, the white emperor raised the sword in his hand again, coalescing a vast sword-shaped shadow that struck at the evil gourmets.
希望先前的伤势不会对师兄造成影响...¤I hope that the earlier injury will not affect Brother...
对付你，我们还用不着两败俱伤¤We don't need to lose both of us against you
白帝楼今后的事宜阿欣应该能够打理，不过还是需要{shidi}多帮忙照料一番。¤Ah Xin should be able to take care of the future of White Emperor House, but will still need {shidi} more help to look after it.
这...现在这个情况，我也没有有十足的把握，还是暂且相信白帝...¤This... I'm not entirely sure about this situation now, so I'll trust the White Emperor for now...
待到灵气平息下来，你再凝神看去，只见到恶饕此时已恢复了正常体型，跪倒在一处岛屿碎片之上，白帝手握诛仙剑，而诛仙剑的另一头，就在恶饕天灵之内。¤When the aura calms down, you then stare at it, only to see that the evil taos have now returned to their normal size, kneeling on top of a fragment of the island, the white emperor holding the sword of immortality, and the other end of the sword of immortality, within the evil taos heavenly spirit.
你也不由得长松一口气。¤And you can't help but breathe a long sigh of relief.
这一剑，为了御剑门！¤This sword, for the Royal Sword Sect!
此言一出，玄骨的脸色立刻难看了起来。¤At these words, Xuan Bone's face immediately turned ugly.
我这副躯体...终究还是没有办法承受神兽的血脉...¤This body of mine... After all, I cannot bear the bloodline of a divine beast...
只见恶饕匆忙间祭起了手中的三柄魔剑，隐隐之中形成了一个残缺的阵法，霎时间凶煞之气不断地从这剑阵中弥漫而出。¤The three demonic swords in his hands were hastily raised, forming a flawed formation, from which a fierce and fierce aura pervaded.
我们走！¤Let's go!
你才将目光移开，身边的战局似乎又起了变化。¤You've only just averted your gaze when the battle around you seems to have changed again.
怎么？你也怕他扛不住这雷劫？¤What? Are you also afraid that he won't be able to withstand this lightning strike?
不知是因为你刚刚斩杀恶饕的那一剑过于骇人，还是震慑于诛仙剑的威能。一时间，竟无一人敢对你动手。¤I don't know if it was because the sword you just used to kill the evil gourmets was too shocking, or because you were shocked by the power of the Immortal Punishing Sword. For a while, no one dared to make a move against you.
想象中的攻击并没有落在你是身上，你只看到恶饕停在了你的身前，一个明晃晃的剑尖从他的胸口透出。¤The imagined attack does not land on you is, all you see is the evil gourmand stopping in front of you, a shiny sword tip penetrating through his chest.
站住，谁允许你走了？¤Stop! Who gave you permission to leave?
凌老儿，这是怎么回事？¤Ling Lao Er, what's going on?
若是你真的问心无愧的话，那心魔劫...¤If you really have a clear conscience, then the Heart Demon Robbery...
天空的劫云再度凝聚，眼看第九道雷劫也迫在眉睫。¤The clouds in the sky were once again gathering, and it looked like the ninth thunderclap was imminent.
不如这样，你们开个价，只要我能拿得出手的，我都可以交给你们，如何？¤How about this: How about you make an offer, and I'll give you anything I can get my hands on?
星宫主言笑了，这里可是无尽之海。若没有金丹期以上的修为，根本不可能活着离开这里。¤The Star Palace Master laughed at his words, this was the Endless Sea. If one did not have a cultivation level above the Golden Dan stage, it would be impossible to leave here alive.
{shidi}，我的时间不多了。¤{shidi}, I'm running out of time.
确实如火麒麟所说，起初白帝尚可与恶饕对攻，但随着半空中劫云慢慢聚集，心有顾虑的白帝也渐渐地有些难以招架。¤As the Fire Qilin said, at first the White Emperor could still fight against the evil gourmets, but as the clouds slowly gathered in mid-air, the White Emperor, who had concerns, gradually became a little more difficult to fight.
哈...哈...哈...星宫主不说我倒是忘了。¤Ha... HA... Ha... I forgot about it if the Star Palace Master didn't tell me.
血薇...你...哎...¤Blood Vee... You... Hey...
你调动全身的灵气，催动诛仙剑刺入了恶饕老祖的身体。¤You mobilise your whole body's spiritual energy and urge the Immortal Punishing Sword to stab into the body of the Evil Taotao Elder.
出手之人竟是血薇。¤The person who struck was actually Bloodwell.
与此前不同，在吞噬了恶饕老祖与三柄魔剑之后，你手中的诛仙剑却变得越来越轻，直到你再也感受不到它的任何重量。自图南海归来后，铁剑带给你的疑惑终于被解开。¤Unlike before, after devouring the evil gourmand and the three demonic swords, the Immortal Punishing Sword in your hand has become lighter and lighter until you can no longer feel any weight from it. The doubts brought to you by the Iron Sword have finally been solved since your return from the South Sea of Tu.
远处剧烈的神识波动打断了众人的沉默，却是星凝那边的战斗终于迎来了尾声。¤A violent soul sense fluctuation in the distance interrupted the silence of the crowd, but it was the battle on Xingning's side that had finally come to an end.
这已是第八道雷劫。看来没有我的拖累，渡过雷劫对轩儿来说并不是什么难事。¤This is already the eighth thunder tribulation. It seems that without my dragging, crossing the thunder tribulation is not a difficult task for Xuan'er.
你这是自寻死...啊！¤You're asking to be killed... Ah!
放心，凌轩的实力我比你更清楚。¤Don't worry, I know Ling Xuan's strength better than you do.
原来如此...看来你们早就调查清楚了。难怪对魔神蛊有所防备。¤So that's it... It seems you have investigated long ago. No wonder you were on guard against the Demon God Compulsion.
众人目送白帝的身影逐渐远去，直到劫云散尽，光柱消失，便再也看不见了。¤The crowd watched the figure of the White Emperor fade away until the robbery clouds cleared and the pillar of light disappeared, and then it was no longer visible.
为什么...魔神蛊居然？¤Why... Demon God compulsion actually?
这已是第八道雷劫的劫云了。看来没有我的拖累，这雷劫对轩儿来说并不是什么难事。¤This is already the eighth thundercloud of the thunder tribulation. It seems that without my drag, this thunder tribulation is not a difficult task for Xuan'er.
看来刚刚的伤势对师兄没造成什么影响...¤It seems that the injuries just sustained did not have much effect on Brother...
我生机已绝，即使重新凝聚肉身，此时也如同无根之水，恐怕时日无多。¤Even if I were to reassemble my body, I would be like water without a root, and I fear that my days are numbered.
便依星宫主的吧。¤Let's go with the Star Palace's master.
那...到底该拿你怎么办呢？不如就由{$TmpTalkString}说了算吧。¤So... What the hell should I do with you? How about we just let {$TmpTalkString} have the last word.
恶饕似乎并没有防备，反倒手臂险些被这道剑影撕裂。¤The evil gourmets did not seem to be on guard, and in turn their arms were nearly torn apart by the sword shadow.
同样的手段，用多了可就不管用了。¤The same tactics don't work if you use them too often.
此言一出，玄骨的脸色立刻轻松了起来。¤At these words, Xuanbone's face immediately relaxed.
在第九道雷劫中，我虽仍能聚气以秘术攻击雷柱，却在后续的防御中败下阵来。¤In the ninth thunderbolt, although I was still able to gather qi to attack the thunder pillar with a secret technique, I was defeated in the subsequent defence.
小友当心！¤Beware, my friend!
恶饕，十万年前你偷袭本座的时候，可曾想到有今天？¤Evil gourmets, when you sneaked up on this throne 100,000 years ago, did you ever think that today would be the day?
你...你竟敢在渡劫时出手？¤You... How dare you strike during the tribulation?
你胸口那颗珠子，怎么不舍得拿出来了？若非凭这这颗宝珠，以你化神初期的修为，能够在本宫手中撑到现在？¤That bead on your chest, why don't you want to take it out? If it weren't for this precious pearl, with your early stage of Deity Transformation cultivation, would you have been able to hold out in my palace's hands until now?
你还是放不下他。¤You still can't let him go.
看着血剑宫众人化作红色的遁光逐渐远去，白帝似乎想说什么，却欲言又止。¤As he watched the Blood Sword Palace crowd turn into red evanescent light and gradually move away, the White Emperor seemed to want to say something, but he wanted to stop talking.
突然一柄血红色的长剑在白帝攻势的间隙中斜杀出来，刺向恶饕的肋下，这一击显然出乎了所有人的意料，恶饕一惊之下攻势暂缓。¤Suddenly a blood-red sword came out in the gap of the White Emperor's attack and stabbed Evil Taotou in the ribs, a blow that clearly took everyone by surprise and slowed his attack.
如今的这柄诛仙剑不仅已经恢复了通天灵宝的威能，甚至还远超当年啊。¤Today, this Immortal Punishing Sword has not only regained its power as a Heavenly Spiritual Treasure, but even far surpasses that of its predecessor.
红莲，绝仙剑已经到手，留在这里已经没有意义了。白帝若是成功渡劫，可不会放过我们。¤Red Lotus, the Absolute Immortal Sword is in our hands, there is no point in staying here anymore. If the White Emperor succeeds in crossing the tribulation, he will not spare us.
兄长，今日戮仙剑已到我们手中，又何必耗费口舌与他相争。¤Brother, the Immortal Executing Sword is already in our hands today, so there is no need to waste our breath arguing with him.
事已至此，莫非你还要逼的我全力出手，与你拼个两败俱伤么！¤Now that the matter has come to this, do you still want to force me to fight you with all my might?
就此别过，来日若有缘，我等自会在上界重逢。¤This is goodbye, and if fate brings us together in the future, we will meet again in the upper realms.
这些古神教的人，留在世上也是祸害。¤These people of the Ancient Gods religion are a scourge even if they remain in the world.
这就要说此剑了。¤This brings us to this sword.
残存的劫云闪动，一道闪电向白帝劈下。¤The remaining robbery cloud flashed and a lightning bolt struck down towards the White Emperor.
诛仙剑，有吞噬之能，为四剑之首。没有想到，它连另外几柄魔剑的能量都可以吞噬。¤The Immortal Punishing Sword, with its ability to devour, is the first of the four swords. I did not expect that it could even devour the energy of several other demonic swords.
不好，那三柄魔剑也要被...¤No good, those three magic swords are also going to be...
是啊，看来诛仙剑当年在图南海吞噬了一部分天道树的本源能量。¤Yes, it seems that the Immortal Punishing Sword had devoured part of the original energy of the Heavenly Dao Tree back in the South China Sea of Tu.
成功了？¤Success?
恶饕悍然出手，欺身冲向白帝，同时一道黑雾也从他天灵飞出，飞向白帝。¤The evil gourmets bully their way towards the White Emperor, while a black mist also flies out from his heavenly spirit towards him.
只见恶饕祭起了手中的三柄魔剑，隐隐之中形成了一个残缺阵法，霎时间凶煞之气不断地从这剑阵中弥漫而出。¤The three demonic swords in his hands were raised, forming a flawed formation, from which a fierce and fierce aura continued to flow out.
今日之事，多谢诸位道友鼎力相助。此番古神教元气大伤，血剑宫和天魔道获得魔剑之后也需要一些时日炼化，他们本就不同心，此后更是觊觎对方手中的魔剑，想必短时间内也不会合力再犯宁州。¤Thank you all for your help in today's incident. This time, the Ancient Gods Sect has been greatly wounded, and the Blood Sword Palace and the Heavenly Demon Dao will need some time to refine the Devil's Sword after obtaining it.
本宫看起来这么容易打发么？¤Does the Palace look so easy to get rid of?
如此正好...¤So just in time...
白帝见状攻势一停，但不曾想到恶饕趁此间隙放出了一道黑雾，飞向白帝。¤Seeing this, the White Emperor stopped his attack, but not expecting Evil Taotou to take advantage of this gap to release a black mist that flew towards the White Emperor.
说罢，恶饕便借剑阵之威向白帝攻去，白帝也压下伤势反攻。一时之间，凶煞之气与剑气不断碰撞、爆发、泯灭。¤After saying this, Evil Taotao used the power of the sword formation to attack the White Emperor, who also suppressed his injuries to counter-attack. For a while, the fierce and fierce Qi and the Sword Qi kept colliding, erupting and disappearing.
另外我这位师弟也请混元子老兄之后照看一二了。¤In addition, I would like to ask my younger brother to take care of him afterwards.
{$TmpTalkString}还真是有一手呢。¤{$TmpTalkString} really has a knack for it.
魏无极又祭起诛仙剑，想要挡在你的面前。但你却紧紧握住剑柄，将之收向身后，同时运起灵气，准备自己挡下恶饕这来势汹汹的一击。¤Wei Wuji raises his Immortal Punishing Sword again, trying to block you. But you grip the hilt of the sword tightly and tuck it away behind you, while at the same time you raise your aura and prepare yourself to block this incoming blow from Evil Taos.
...不能¤... Can't
红莲尊者，按之前的约定，绝仙剑归你了。¤Venerable Red Lotus, as previously agreed, the Absolute Immortal Sword is yours.
混元子，马上要对付最后一道雷劫了，这样下去可不妙。但本座却也不敢随意插手，怕反倒干扰到他。你和白帝多年至交，可有什么办法？¤The last lightning tribulation is about to be dealt with, and it is not good to go on like this. But I dare not intervene at will, for fear of interfering with him. You and the White Emperor have been friends for many years, do you have any ideas?
既然如此，那你也一起死吧！¤In that case, you die with me!
随着魏无极的言语，白帝并没有如同传说中飞升而去，反而慢慢落地。¤With Wei Wuji's words, the White Emperor did not soar away as in the legend, but instead slowly landed on the ground.
吼...那三柄魔剑被血剑宫的人抢去了。¤Roar... Those three demonic swords were snatched away by the people of the Blood Sword Palace.
你要怎么样才肯放过我？不如开出个价来。若是逼的我毁去储物袋，你们什么也别想得到！¤What will it take for you to let me go? How about putting a price on it? If you force me to destroy my pouch, you won't get anything!
白帝拿出了诛仙剑。¤The White Emperor took out the Immortal Punishing Sword.
其实当年你就没有骗过我¤In fact, you never lied to me back then
算了，今天已经打的够多了，让他走吧。¤Forget it, we've had enough of a fight for today, let him go.
这...还有这些六品丹药，六品灵舟，六品阵旗，...只要我诸位肯放过我，我都可以双手奉上！¤This... And these sixth-grade pills, sixth-grade spirit boats, sixth-grade formation flags... I'll give them all to you with both hands as long as you're willing to let me go!
即使一旁有四个化神相助，你依然在恶饕的攻势下节节败退。¤Even with the help of four Deity Transformation cultivators, you are still losing ground to the attack of the evil gourmets.
若谁还想要夺剑的，大可来试上一试。¤If anyone still wants to take the sword, they can come and try.
不妙！凌老儿我来助你！¤Not good! I'll help you, Ling!
今日我未能帮师傅重塑肉身...以后的事，唯有拜托你了。¤Today I was unable to help Master rebuild his physical body... The only thing I can do from now on is to ask you.
但是...渡劫失败必然灰飞烟灭，你又如何能够站在此处？¤But... How can you stand here when a failed attempt to cross the tribulation will surely destroy you?
此时你知道了又能如何？¤What can you do if you know at this point?
我知道¤I know
哼，总算没有白费本座的功夫。¤Hmph, after all, it was not a waste of my seat's efforts.
周天灵气开始像疯了般灌入诛仙剑中，这股力量甚至逼得周围得其它化神强者也不得不退避三舍。¤The spiritual qi of the surrounding sky began to pour into the Immortal Punishing Sword like crazy, and this power even forced other strong Deity Transformation practitioners around to retreat.
接着一个巨大的火球飞出，不再抵抗的恶饕老祖转眼之间便灰飞烟灭...¤Then a huge fireball flew out, and the evil gourmets who no longer resisted were destroyed in a flash...
这枚定神珠可是用六品材料精心炼制而成的上品通天灵宝，以星宫主的眼光，应该知道它的价值。¤This God Fixing Pearl is a top-grade Heavenly Spiritual Treasure carefully refined from sixth-grade materials, and with the Star Palace Master's vision, he should know its value.
没想到...小小一个御剑门...留下了这么多的后患...¤I never thought... A small Royal Sword Sect... It has left so many problems behind...
这定神珠对星宫来说也算有些用处，我便带回去了。剩下的东西，都归你。¤This God Fixing Pearl is of some use to the Star Palace, so I will take it back with me. The rest is yours.
此时恶饕被白帝刺出的伤口逐渐愈合，留下了一道疤痕，即使在他扭曲的肉体上，这道疤痕也显得格外狰狞。¤At this point the wound that Evil Tau had been stabbed with by the White Emperor gradually healed, leaving a scar that looked particularly hideous even on his twisted flesh.
就在此刻，你隐约听到远处传来“嗖”的一声。¤Just then, you faintly hear a whoosh in the distance.
玄骨这老贼终于被我...欸，武陵城这老头是什么情况？¤This old thief Xuan Bone has finally been me... Hey, what's the deal with this old man in Wuling City?
是魔神蛊，原来是之前偷袭时...¤It's the Demon God compulsion. It turns out that it was during the previous sneak attack...
千余年来，古神教利用魔神蛊控制他人，又何止害了御剑门一家？今日，你便要玄骨为此付出代价！¤For more than a thousand years, the Ancient God Sect has used the Demon God Compulsion to control others, and has harmed more than just the Royal Sword Sect. Today, you will make Xuan Bone pay for this!
小友你先退下，这里有我们便足够了。¤You can leave us here.
真没想到...小小一个御剑门...留下了这么多的后患...¤What a surprise... A small Royal Sword Sect... It has left so many problems behind...
到底成功了么？这是所有人的疑问。¤Did it work? That was the question on everyone's mind.
此时一道红色遁光飞来，竟是血薇去而又返，她静静地站在远处，目光直视白帝。¤At that moment, a red light flew in, and it was Blood Wei who had returned, standing quietly in the distance, her eyes looking straight at the White Emperor.
噢...还有这三阳锻魄丹。这可是能够提升神识的六品丹药，星宫主应该刚好用得上吧？¤Oh... There's also this Three Yang Forging Pill. It's a sixth grade pill capable of enhancing soul sense, so the Star Palace Master should just about be able to use it, right?
白帝似乎把事情都交代完了，一时沉默了下来。¤The White Emperor seemed to have explained everything, and there was a moment of silence.
适才吓退血亢已是不易，此番事了，古神教元气大伤，血剑宫和天魔道获得魔剑之后也需要一些时日炼化，而在他们眼中，诛仙剑已由我飞升带往上界，想必短时间内也不会合力再犯宁州。¤It was not easy to scare off the blood overlord just now. After this incident, the Ancient God Sect has been greatly injured, and the Blood Sword Palace and the Heavenly Demon Path will need some time to refine the sword after obtaining it.
数道雷劫依次劈下，第八道雷劫带来的压迫力远超之前。白帝稳坐其中，身上的护罩不断明灭，却也始终没有破开。¤Several thunderclaps struck in turn, and the eighth thunderclap brought a far greater oppressive force than before. The White Emperor sat steadily in the midst of it, the shield on his body constantly brightening and decreasing, but it never broke open.
恶饕借剑阵之威又向白帝攻去，一时之间，凶煞之气与剑气不断碰撞、爆发、泯灭。¤The evil gourmets used the power of the sword formation to attack the White Emperor again, and for a while, the fierce and fierce Qi and the Sword Qi continued to collide, explode and die out.
没想到还是让你成功了¤I didn't think you'd make it.
在众人的注视下，玄骨面色铁青的将储物袋掷于你。等你清点完毕示意无误后，才同意放他离开。¤As the crowd looks on, Xuan Bone tosses his storage bag to you with a grimace. Only after you have counted it and signalled that it is correct do you agree to let him go.
此事自有天道来判。¤This matter will be judged by Heaven itself.
兄长，今日我们只是为戮仙剑而来。如今戮仙剑已在手中，再说这些又有何益。¤Brother, today we are only here for the Immortal Executing Sword. Now that the Immortal Killing Sword is in our hands, what is the point of talking about it.
他手中的陷仙剑，戮仙剑与绝仙剑飞至半空，爆发出耀眼的红光，似乎想要与诛仙剑抗衡，但这光芒很快便黯淡了下去。¤The Immortal Trapping Sword, Immortal Executing Sword and Immortal Exterminating Sword in his hands flew to mid-air, exploding with a dazzling red light, seemingly trying to fight against the Immortal Punishing Sword, but this light soon dulled.
轩儿，你...¤Xuan'er, you...
白帝并未说话，只是摄走了你手中的诛仙剑，并静静地看着恶饕。¤The White Emperor did not speak, but merely took away the sword of immortality from your hand and looked silently at the evil gourmets.
众人就这么看着一白一红两道身影慢慢远去，渐渐消失在远处的风暴中。¤The crowd just watched as the two figures, one white and one red, slowly moved away and faded into the distant storm.
看起来似乎一切都要结束了，但你们的身后又传来了星凝的声音。¤It looks as if it's all coming to an end, but behind you comes the sound of Starling's voice again.
便依凝儿的吧。¤Let's go with Ning's.
随手除去几个暗哨后，你带着炎萧来到了天魔眼核心的中心地带。¤After casually removing a few dark sentries, you led Yan Xiao to the heart of the core of the Heavenly Devil's Eye.
未等你和炎萧细看，这魔修的身躯已是消失无踪，只留一堆原本裹着肉体的破布散落在地。¤Before you and Yan Xiao look closely, the body of the evil cultivator has disappeared without a trace, leaving only a pile of rags originally wrapped in flesh scattered on the ground.
其中站得最近的那个正高举双手，有魔气源源不断涌出的脸上满是狂喜。这种表情别说出现在苦心悟道的修士脸上，连在为七情六欲所困的凡人脸上也是难得一见。¤The one standing closest is holding his hands high, with a steady stream of magic energy gushing out of his face full of ecstasy. This kind of expression, not to mention the face of the cultivator suffering from enlightenment, even in the face of mortals trapped by the seven emotions and six desires is also rare to see.
你也不在意这些蝼蚁的死活，眼中只有勉强恢复了些实力的天魔。后者也像是感知到了危险，迅速地从魔气团的形状转化为战斗状态。¤You don't care if these mole crickets are dead or alive, and the only thing in your eyes is the sky devil who has barely regained some strength. The latter also seems to perceive the danger, quickly transformed from the shape of the magic gas mass to a combat state.
嗯，他们原本的计划应该是用我手上的天魔晶为天魔恢复实力，却在{FirstName}{$NickName}的插手下未能如愿。¤Well, their original plan should be to use the heavenly devil crystal in my hand to restore strength for the heavenly devil, but failed to do so under {FirstName}{$NickName}'s meddling.
难怪天魔道会追杀炎萧{$ChenHu}到海上。¤No wonder the Heavenly Demon Path will chase Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} to the sea.
造成这一状况的，正是你们追寻的目标——天魔道修士！¤Caused by this situation, it is the target of your pursuit - the Heavenly Demon Road cultivators!
只见有金、蓝、绿、红、黄五色光柱从远处投射而来，与中心上方汇聚成一束温暖的光柱直落而下。顺着光柱往下看则是满地晦涩的阵法纹路，由落点下方呈放射状发散而出，¤I saw five pillars of gold, blue, green, red and yellow light projected from afar, and converged with the center above to form a warm pillar of light falling straight down. Look down the column of light is full of obscure formation patterns, from the point of fall below the radiating out.
而后便是有另一个魔修走上前去，依样献祭。¤And then there was another evil cultivator who went up and offered sacrifice in the same way.
除去几个暗哨后，你和炎萧有惊无险地闯到了天魔眼核心的中心地带。¤After removing a few dark posts, you and Yan Xiao broke into the heart of the core of the Heavenly Demon Eye without any danger.
你一挥衣袍，身形也出现在天魔近旁，抬手便是神通与法宝齐飞。¤With a wave of your robe, your figure also appears close to the Heavenly Demon, raising your hand is the divine ability and magic treasures flying together.
小心些。¤Be careful.
三个天魔道修士正将一团不断壮大的魔气围住。¤Three Heavenly Demon Dao cultivators are surrounding a growing cloud of demonic energy.
你应了一声，便驱使着法宝向天魔攻去。¤You answered, and drove the magic treasure to attack the heavenly devil.
这些魔修似乎是隔绝了天魔眼核心阵法，而后用献祭的方式为天魔恢复状态。¤These evil cultivators seem to isolate the core formation of the Heavenly Devil's Eye, and then use the sacrifice to restore the state of the Heavenly Devil.
好，那由我来对付天魔，{FirstName}{$NickName}设法拖住两个元婴修士，可好？¤The first thing you need to do is to take care of the demons, and try to hold off the two YuanYing cultivators, okay?
眼下对方只有未完全恢复的天魔和两个元婴魔修，不说击败他们，但拖到葛道友和宁州正派的支援到来，还是能做到的。¤Now the other side only not fully recovered heavenly devil and two YuanYing devil cultivators, not to say defeat them, but to delay until the arrival of Daoist Ge and Ning Province support, or can do.
这次也会是如此。¤That will be the case this time as well.
除去几个暗哨后，你和炎萧轻易地摸到了天魔眼核心的中心地带。¤After removing a few dark sentries, you and Yan Xiao easily touched the heart of the core of the sky devil's eye.
你应了一声，便驱使着法宝攻上前去。¤You answered, and then drove the magic treasure to attack the front.
嗯，这一次也要阻止他们。¤Well, this time, stop them as well.
也好，我尽快解决魔修之后便会来支援你，多加小心。¤Good, I will come to support you after I solve the evil cultivator as soon as possible, be more careful.
就让我来看看前人只能封印的天魔究竟有何能耐。¤Just let me see what the Heavenly Demon that the previous people could only seal is capable of.
侥幸而已。¤It was just a fluke.
看这情况，若是再拖延些时间，让天魔的实力完全恢复，对宁州必是一场浩劫。眼下有葛前辈通知其他门派，不如我们先行阻挠一番，等候支援。¤Looking at this situation, if we delay some more time and let the Heavenly Demon's strength fully recover, it will definitely be a catastrophe for Ning Province. Right now there is senior Ge to inform the other sects, why don't we obstruct some first and wait for support.
剩余的元婴魔修反应倒是挺快，你刚出手已是退至一旁，有个遁速稍慢的，被你神通堪堪擦中，虽还能起身战斗但也是身受重伤，¤The remaining YuanYing evil cultivator reaction is quite fast, you just shot is already retreating to the side, there is a slightly slower transport speed, by your divine power can be rubbed, although still able to get up to fight but also is seriously injured.
前辈，有何事吩咐？¤Senior, what do you want?
小娃娃，凭你这点道行，恐怕还不是贫道的对手。¤Little Wawa, with your delicacy, I am afraid that you are not yet a poor opponent.
哼...\n¤Hmm... \n
若不是那古神教咄咄逼人，我玄古门在衡州也算是一方霸主。¤If it were not for the aggressive Ancient God Sect, my Profound Ancient Sect would be considered a dominant force in Hengzhou.
对面惊讶的一挑眉头。¤The other side raised an eyebrow in surprise.
“咔嚓，咔嚓”¤'Click, click, click.''
不过精炼麒麟血可是一件水磨工夫，我此次闭关至少10年。到时候，你来巫山古月寨找我。¤However, refining the blood of the qilin is a watery task, and I will be in seclusion for at least 10 years. When the time comes, come and find me at Ancient Moon Cottage in Wushan Mountain.
道友若是有四品的金丹期鲲族的心脏就请帮我带来吧。¤If you, Daoist, have the heart of a fourth-grade Jindan stage Kun clan please bring it for me.
看来阁下也精于炼丹之道。¤It seems that your Excellency is also skilled in the art of alchemy.
真的很抱歉，这几枚血菩提就当是道友此行的报酬吧。¤I am really sorry, these blood bodhi will be considered as the payment for your trip.
不过现在仅仅是丧家之犬罢了。¤But now it's just a mere bereavement.
道友多虑了，这一项乃是本门大忌，一经发现必为宗门追杀，我玄古门是不屑于做这种事的。¤This item is a big taboo for our clan. Once discovered, you will be hunted down and killed by the clan, and my Profound Ancient clan does not care to do such things.
{LastName}，等你准备好我就也为你铭刻灵纹，哈哈哈。¤{LastName}, when you are ready I will inscribe the spirit mark for you as well, hahaha.
嗯，我并没有放弃，只是此事目前确实陷入了瓶颈我要整理一下思路。¤Well, I'm not giving up, it's just that the matter is really at a bottleneck at the moment and I need to organize my thoughts.
道友，也是来购买丹药的么？我玄古门的丹药在衡州可是鼎鼎有名的。¤Fellow Daoist, are you also here to buy pills? The Pills of my Profound Ancient Sect are well known in Heng Zhou.
原来是{FirstName}道友久仰久仰，我玄古门会定期在此地售卖丹药。你若是有需要可以来看看。¤So it's {FirstName}Daoist friend long time ago, my Profound Ancient Sect will regularly sell pills here. You can come and have a look if you need.
只是最近本门大护法研究出一套法门，我们已经可以从豹麟兽的精血中提炼麒麟血了。¤It's just that recently our Great Guardian has researched a set of techniques and we have been able to extract the qilin blood from the essence of the leopard-lin beast.
还记得我之前说，我之前铭刻灵纹使用的是豹麟兽的精血么，这豹麟兽乃是蕴含麒麟血脉的异兽。使用它的血就有如此效果，若是真的麒麟血功效更是天壤之别。¤Remember what I said before, I used the blood of the Leopard Lin Beast to engrave the spirit tattoo, this Leopard Lin Beast is a foreign beast containing the bloodline of the Qilin. If the blood of this beast has such an effect, if it is the blood of a real qilin, the effect will be even greater.
不论如何，{FirstName}道友这次帮了大忙，这炼妖散和血菩提你先收好。¤No matter what, {FirstName}Daoist has helped a lot this time, this Demon Refining Scatter and Blood Bodhi you keep first.
哈哈，哪里哪里。¤Haha, you flatter me.
衡州？¤Hengshu?
多亏道友拿到火蟾的心脏，现在这炼妖散已经制成了；只是灵纹的存续依旧没有解决，这些普通妖族血脉中缺乏一种灵性，让灵纹难以存续。¤Thanks to you getting the heart of the fire toad, this demon refining scatter has now been made; only the survival of the spirit pattern remains unresolved, these ordinary demon bloodlines lack a spiritual nature that makes it difficult for the spirit pattern to survive.
哪里的话，{FirstName}道友想要自然可以，只是我现在手头没有材料。¤If you don't want to, you can, naturally, but I don't have the materials on hand right now.
那有什么我可以帮忙的么？¤So is there anything I can do to help?
再加之炼妖散需要妖兽的精血，我自己也不是一时之间也收集不到那么多。¤Plus, the refining of the demon pills requires the blood of Spirit Beasts, and it's not like I couldn't collect that much on my own for a while.
哈哈哈，是“我们”收获不小。你看，¤Hahahaha, it's ''we'' who are getting a lot of bang for our buck. Look at that.
确实，本门的炼丹手法不拘泥于草木灵物，故而和传统的丹药不太一样。¤Indeed, our school's alchemy is not bound to grass and wood spirits, so it is not quite the same as traditional pills.
这次看来进展不小，还有什么我可以帮忙的么？¤It seems to have made a lot of progress this time, is there anything else I can do to help?
竟有这等神乎其技的秘法，你们玄古门中兴有望啊。¤You have such a miraculous secret technique, your Profound Ancient Sect is expected to prosper.
你这次收获不小吧。¤You've gained a lot this time, haven't you?
而且这精炼麒麟血由我主持，到时候作为奖励我可以分润到一份麟血，正好够你我的用量。¤Moreover, I will preside over this refined qilin blood, and when the time comes, I will be able to share in a share of the blood as a reward, which is just enough for you and me.
我已经找到了。¤I have found it.
经过这次实验，我现在对火系元婴大妖的体质很感兴趣。¤After this experiment, I am now interested in the physiology of the fire-based Gentoo demons.
嗯，是的。¤Well, yes.
只是....¤Just ....
按照之前的理论，感觉还是需要无尽之海的鲲族帮帮啊。¤According to the previous theory, it feels like we still need help from the Kuns of the Endless Sea.
说罢，他伸出左手繁复的灵纹附于其上，只见其灵力流转之后一层甲壳覆盖在手上，他右手拿出一柄法宝级的剑，向手甲斩去。¤After saying this, he stretched out his left hand with intricate spiritual patterns attached to it, only to see a layer of armour covering his hand after the flow of its spiritual power, he took out a magic treasure grade sword in his right hand and chopped at the hand armour.
不愧是{FirstName}道友，这等材料也能快速找到。¤Not bad for a {FirstName} daoist to be able to find such materials quickly.
（我还没有找到。）¤(I haven't found it yet.)
轩岚诺摆摆手，一脸无奈。¤Xuan Lanuo waved his hand with a helpless look.
道友帮我寻找一下，五品火蟾的心脏吧。¤Fellow Daoist, help me find it, the heart of a fifth-grade fire toad.
我看你刚刚的售卖清单是没有炼妖散的。¤I see that the sale list you just made does not have Demon Refining Scatter.
这一股腥甜之气，感觉是...精血？¤This fishy-sweet smell feels like... Essence blood?
道友是想问那日与人相斗时的灵纹么？¤Do you want to ask about the spirit patterns from that day when you fought with someone?
确实，我辈修仙之人本就是逆天而行，讲究夺万物之灵以强己身。本门行事与猎杀妖兽有何区别？¤Indeed, we immortal cultivators are supposed to act against the heavens, to take the spirit of all things to strengthen ourselves. What is the difference between what our school does and hunting Spirit Beasts?
离火门老祖，化神期妖圣，纯血麒麟；让人很是嫉妒呢。¤The oldest ancestor of the Heavenly Fire Gate, a demon saint at the Deity Transformation stage and a pure-blooded qilin; it makes people very jealous yet.
这个....还是不行么，鲲族说到底也只不过是鲲鹏后裔，虽说实力强劲但是血脉的精纯程度属实一般。¤This .... The Kun tribe in the end is only descendants of the Kun Peng, although the strength is strong but the degree of purity of the bloodline is really general.
你当我吃药吃傻了么？我又不是嫌自己活得太久。¤Do you think I'm dumb on pills? It's not like I've lived too long.
还挺可惜的，有什么我可以帮忙的么？¤It's quite a shame, is there anything I can do to help?
嗯，不过无尽之海凶险异常你切莫勉强自己，我这边自己也在想想办法。¤Well, but the Endless Sea is extremely dangerous, so don't force yourself, and I'm trying to think of a way to do it myself.
再加之也不知为何那只鲲的血脉之中灵力甚是驳杂，确实是有问题。¤Plus somehow there was something wrong with that Kun as the spiritual energy in its bloodline was very mixed.
在上次之后，灵纹铭刻之法已经趋于完善。这一次得了麒麟血，正好可以报答{LastName}你的救命之恩以及之前的帮助。¤After the last time, the method of inscribing spirit patterns has been perfected. This time I have obtained the blood of the Qilin, just in time to repay {LastName} you for saving my life and for your previous help.
嗯，天魔道将修士凡人视为“肉参”，手段令人发指。¤Well, the Heavenly Demon Path treats mortal cultivators as ''meat cakes'', and the methods are outrageous.
聊了这么久，在下玄古门轩岚诺，还未请教道友高姓大名？¤I have been talking for so long, I am Xuan Lan Nuo of the Profound Ancient Sect, I have not yet asked you your name?
嗯，灵纹除了模拟妖兽本命天赋的灵气运转之外，也在潜移默化的让手术者吸收精血的灵性，一般的妖兽血脉中的灵性很是稀薄，故而不能持久。¤Well, in addition to simulating the operation of the aura of a Spirit Beast's innate talent, the spirit tattoo is also subliminally allowing the operator to absorb the spirituality of the essence blood, which is generally very thin in the bloodline of a Spirit Beast and therefore cannot last.
用量？¤Quantity used?
不愧是{LastName}，这宝贝我可得好好研究研究。¤Not bad for {LastName}, this is a gem I'll have to look into.
看来这次是不能铭刻灵纹了，这些是我最近自己收集到的天材地宝你先收好，你为这东西以身犯险总不好叫你空手而归。¤It seems that I can't engrave the spirit pattern this time. These are the heavenly treasures I have collected recently.
我现在对海上妖兽很是感兴趣，但是在宁州确实很难收集到材料¤I am now very interested in sea Spirit Beasts, but it is really difficult to collect materials in Ning Province
多谢道友拿到的心脏，但金丹期的妖力根本不足以铭刻新版的灵纹，也不足以炼制炼妖散了。¤Thanks for the heart you got, but the demon power at the Jindan stage is simply not enough to inscribe the new version of the spirit pattern or to refine the demon refining scatter anymore.
“噌”的一声，只见他左手未伤分毫。¤With a sound of ''miso'', he saw that his left hand was unharmed.
按照现在的进度我需要10年时间，我将成品分你一份。¤At the current rate of progress I need 10 years and I will share the finished product with you.
未等你回答他就自问自答。¤He asks himself a question before you answer.
轩岚诺左手骨甲脱落，掌心是的灵纹也随之溃散，这情景就好似你们初识之时。¤The bone armour on Xuan Lanuo's left hand fell off, and the spirit pattern on his palm collapsed, just as it did when you first met.
不要沮丧，此事本就是夺天地之造化，侵日月之玄机。自古以来觊觎这份力量的能人异士不知多少。¤Don't be disheartened, this is a matter of taking over the creation of heaven and earth and invading the mysteries of the sun and moon. Since ancient times, there have been countless people who have coveted this power.
嗯，是妖兽精血。怎么道友也如同那些迂腐之辈认为此乃邪道？¤Well, it is the blood of a Spirit Beast. How is it that you, too, are like those pedantic people who think this is an evil path?
灵性？¤Spirituality?
我现在还要理理思路，还用不到{LastName}你帮忙。¤I have to sort out my thoughts now and I don't need {LastName} your help yet.
额，你不会是要以我二人之力图谋化神妖圣吧？！！¤You're not going to use the two of us to try to reach Deity Transformation Demon Saint, are you?
是要五品元婴期的鲲族心脏么。¤Is it for a fifth-grade Genesis Kun heart.
你这丹药似乎不是以常规手法炼制吧。¤You don't seem to have made this Pill in the usual way, do you?
道友想说，以血肉炼丹总让人想到天魔道之流？¤Do you want to say that the use of flesh and blood to make pills always reminds people of the stream of the Heavenly Demon Path?
按照现在的进度我需要10年时间。¤At the current rate I need 10 years.
还需要很多妖兽的精血做实验。¤It also requires the blood of many Spirit Beasts for experimentation.
徒手接白刃，有时候真的很羡慕这些身怀金钥匙出身的种族啊。¤Sometimes I envy these races who are born with the golden key.
原来如此，那是我唐突了。¤I see, that was a tangent on my part.
你看得出来他很兴奋。¤You could tell he was excited.
不愧是{FirstName}道友，按照现在的进度我需要10年时间，我将成品分你一份。¤Not bad for a {FirstName} daoist, at the current rate of progress I need 10 years and I will share the finished product with you.
道友，可知炎麟大圣？¤Fellow Daoist, do you know the Great Sage Yan Lin?
怎么突然提及？¤Why the sudden mention?
我本意是将其永久的铭刻在肉体上，就如同妖兽的本命神通一般，不过现在还很不完善。¤I had intended it to be permanently inscribed on the flesh, like the native divine power of a Spirit Beast, but it is still very imperfect.
炼妖散毕竟是本门机密，就算是我改良的也不好公开交易。¤After all, the Demon Refining Scatter is a secret of our clan, so even if I improved it, it is not good to trade it publicly.
话说二姐与三妹这两个称谓是从何而来？¤Where did the terms second sister and third sister come from?
（腼腆地）嗯，比之前好多了。¤(coyly) Well, it's better than before.
唉…此事还需从长计议，荧儿莫要气馁才好。¤Alas...this matter needs to be considered in the long run, so don't be discouraged.
（腼腆地）你觉得荧儿是坏人嘛？¤(coyly) Do you think Ying'er is a bad person?
呐…究竟要怎么做，才算一个善良的人呢？¤Nah...what exactly does it take to be a kind person?
真正的人，除了这些以外，一定还具备很多我们没有的东西吧？¤A real person must have a lot more than that that we don't have, right?
（腼腆地）我擅自把负面的想法都丢给三妹…还害那么多无辜的魂体丧命……¤(coyly) I took the liberty of throwing all my negative thoughts at my third sister... and got so many innocent souls killed ......
（腼腆地）嗯…你来啦？¤(coyly) Well...you're here?
但现在看来，这些阴暗的想法并不会消失，只是有人帮我承担了而已。¤But now it seems that these dark thoughts don't go away, someone just takes them on for me.
我不做坏事，也只是有人帮我做了而已…我至始至终只是躲在后面，不敢面对。¤I don't do bad things, I just have people who do them for me...I just hide behind them to the end, afraid to face them.
有天赋只是一方面，但其实她对人的认识却是最少的，就像小孩子一样，要哄才行。¤Having talent is only one aspect, but in fact she has the least understanding of people and, like a child, has to be coaxed into doing so.
你恢复的怎么样了？¤How are you recovering?
那你们后来聊过了嘛？¤So did you talk afterwards?
保护我的是姐姐，需要保护的是妹妹，就这么叫下来啦。¤The one who protects me is my sister, the one who needs protection is my sister, and so it goes.
这…此事牵扯甚多，无法轻易定论…不过我并不觉得荧儿是坏人。¤This...is a very involved matter and cannot be easily determined...but I don't think Fluorescent is a bad person.
（腼腆地）在我们的开导下，三妹也终于开口说话了。¤(coyly) Thanks to our enlightenment, third sister also finally spoke up.
（腼腆地）嗯…其实二和三只是诞生的顺序。¤(coyly) Well... actually two and three are only in the order of birth.
（腼腆地）二姐还是和往常一样，但是她只是支持我的想法，并没有自己的建议。¤(coyly) My second sister was as usual, but she only supported my ideas and had no suggestions of her own.
（腼腆地）没…只恢复了一点点…¤(coyly) No...just a little bit...
（腼腆地）嗯…在伤势恢复之前，我会一直等在这里。¤(coyly) Well... I'll wait here until I recover from my injuries.
可能是那次对她的打击太大了吧。¤Maybe it was that time that hit her too hard.
（腼腆地）以前觉得，只要自己没有阴暗的想法，自己不做坏事，就是一个善良的人。¤(coyly) I used to think that if I didn't have dark thoughts and I didn't do bad things, I was a good person.
原来如此…¤So that's how it is...
今日便聊到这吧，我还会再回来看你的。¤That's all for today, I'll be back to see you again.
你能想到这些，就已经是一个善良的人了。¤You're already a good person if you can think of that.
她叹了一口气。¤She sighed.
她点了点头。¤She nodded her head.
而三妹从那之后就再也没有和我们说过话了……¤And third sister has not spoken to us since then ......
坏人？从何说起？¤Bad people? Where do I start?
在那之后，我再也没有把任何负面的东西丢给三妹，所以也开始慢慢地理解三妹了。¤After that, I never threw any negative things to third sister again, so I also began to slowly understand third sister.
三妹不是很强嘛？为什么还需要保护？¤Isn't the third sister very strong? Why does she still need protection?
聊过之后，我觉得我们中任何一人与真正的人相比都是不完整的，我想先成为一个真正的人。¤After talking, I feel that any one of us is incomplete compared to a real person, and I want to become a real person first.
（低声）我们两分头想办法在府里打听我大姐婚事的消息，等晚上我再想办法来找你。¤(Whispering) We split up to find a way to find out about my elder sister's marriage in the house, and I will find a way to find you in the evening.
{FirstName}道友你就先住在这儿吧，有什么事可以找府里的小厮。¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, you can live here first. If you have anything, you can ask the servant in the mansion.
“终于来了。”¤Finally, it's here.
你一路寻来，尽管没有确切的消息，但排除了许多地方，也打探了些线索。¤You have searched all the way here, although there is no exact news, but ruled out many places, but also poked some clues.
良久，一名魂体在岛上收集完神阴石后，才刚飞出岛，一条触须便从海底伸出，将它瞬间吸嗜殆尽。¤A long time later, a soul body had only just flown out of the island after collecting the divine Yin stones when a tentacle reached out from the bottom of the sea and sucked it out of its thirst instantly.
“此妖不除，不知又要祸害多少人。”¤This demon is not removed, I do not know how many more people will be harmed.
经过一番调查，你找到了那只特殊的元婴水母之所在。¤After some investigation, you found the location of the special genesis jellyfish.
收起神识，你极速前往事发地，运起功法便向它攻去。¤Put away the soul sense, you go to the place where it happened very quickly, and attack it with your kung fu.
想到此处，你运起功法便向它攻去。¤Thinking of this, you run up the power method will attack it.
趁着这个瞬间，你看清了它的本体——一只元婴期的冥河水母。你感觉它与一般水母有些不同，但初看之下也说不出个所以然。¤Taking advantage of this moment, you see its original body - a YuanYing stage placid jellyfish. You feel that it is a little different from ordinary jellyfish, but at first glance you can't tell.
最终，你找到了一处最可疑的地方，放开神识，静待幽厄的出现。¤In the end, you found a most suspicious place, let go of your soul sense, and waited for the appearance of the mysterious evil.
咳咳...没想到这件法宝威力这么大，还是先回宗门再说。¤Ahem... I didn't expect this magic weapon to be so powerful, I should return to the sect first.
你看四下无人，便捏了个法决，将两人尸体处理掉，然后飞快地离开了。¤Looking at no one around, you squeezed a squeeze, disposing of the two bodies, and then left quickly.
咳咳...没想到这件法宝威力这么大，还是先离开这里吧。¤Ahem... I didn't expect this magic weapon to be so powerful, let's get out of here first.
你检查躺在地上的男子，发现他已经断气了。¤You check the man lying on the ground and find that he has broken off.
而不通炼器之道的你显然也就是手忙脚乱的那一个。¤And do not know the way of refining, you are obviously the handy one.
说罢，大家便起火热炉开始在长老的指点下融化材料，有人得心应手也有的手忙脚乱。¤With that said, everyone started to heat up the furnace and began to melt the ingredients under the guidance of the elders, some with ease and some with fumbling.
索性之后没有什么意外的顺利成器了。¤Solely nothing unexpected went smoothly into the vessel afterwards.
即使按照长老的示范，融化的材料也如同不听话的顽童不愿聚集在一起，在台上示范的长老注意到你这边的情况。¤Even when following the elders' demonstration, the melted material is like disobedient urchins unwilling to gather together and the elders demonstrating on stage notice your side.
她先是一惊，疑惑的抬头看向你。¤She looks up at you first with a start, puzzled.
即使按照长老的示范，融化的材料也如同不听话的顽童不远聚集在一起。¤Even after following the elders' demonstration, the melted materials did not gather together as disobedient urchins.
大家在长老的指点下按部就班的进行着，稍有出错的人也被长老及时纠正。¤Everyone proceeded in a step-by-step manner under the guidance of the elders, and those who made slight mistakes were corrected by the elders in time.
嗯，多谢。¤Oh, Many thanks!
长老见人来的差不多了，便宣布炼器大会开始。¤When the elders saw that almost everyone had come, they announced the start of the weapon smelting conference.
噗呲~你这样强行捏合材料是不行的。¤Pfft~ You can't forcefully pinch materials like that.
好了，本次炼器大会到此为止，你们细细体会个中细节，希望你们在炼器之道上走的更远。¤Well, this is the end of this smithing conference. You will experience the details and I hope that you will go further in the path of smithing.
本门炼器大会既是为了精进门下弟子炼器之道，也是为了补充宗门制式法器。¤The Sect's Weapon Making Conference is designed both to refine the disciples' path of weapon making and to supplement the Sect's system of magic weapons.
我会在台上炼制法宝做示范，你们跟着我一步步来炼制法器、符器，宗门资源来之不易，切记不要出了差错。明白么？¤I will demonstrate on the stage by refining magic treasures, and you will follow me step by step to refine magic weapons and talismans. Do you understand?
多谢长老指点。¤Thank you, Elder, for your guidance.
嗯，你先在一旁稍作等候。¤Well, you wait aside for a moment.
你一边手掐法诀一道道灵纹融入器胚之中，一边对边上的女弟子暗暗传音指点。¤As you do so, you are able to incorporate a spiritual pattern into the tool embryo, while giving secret instructions to the female disciple at your side.
她按照你说的做手中动作不再慌乱，器胚也稳定起来。¤She does as you say the movements in her hands are no longer panicky and the vessel embryo is stable.
唉，你这个样子如何成器呢？按我说的做，听仔细了啊，我再讲一遍。¤Alas, how can you become a man in this condition? Do as I say, and listen carefully, for I will say it again.
谢长老教诲。¤Thank you, Elder, for your teaching.
你是来参加炼器大会的？（炼器大会需消耗两年时间）¤Are you here for the Weapon Making Competition? (The smithing convention takes two years)
台上长老，若有所思的望向你，想你传音道。¤The elders on the platform, looking at you thoughtfully, want you to transmit a message.
嗯，我作为炼器长老也是分内之事。¤Well, it's also my part as a Weaponry Refining Elder.
别慌，按我说的做~¤Don't panic, just do as I say~
在你旁边的女弟子就是手忙脚乱的人之一。¤The female disciple next to you is one of those who has her hands full.
在她的指点下融化的材料逐渐听话起来开始粘合在一起。¤Under her guidance the melting material gradually obeyed and began to bond together.
慌乱的她吸引了长老的注意力，在长老的呵斥下，总算转危为安安全成器。¤Panicking, she attracts the attention of the elders and, with their scolding, finally turns the tables and becomes safe.
同门之间互相帮助也是应该的，再说你这个器胚要是爆开来我也要遭殃呢。¤It's only right that we help each other, and I'll be in trouble if your weapon explodes.
之后有宗门长老收取了你们炼制的法宝。¤Afterwards a clan elder collected the magic treasures you had made.
以你的炼器造诣，区区成器不在话下，你甚至有余力看看其他同门。¤With your refining attainments, it is not a matter of becoming a weapon in the district, and you even have the spare capacity to look at other fellow disciples.
台上台下的长老和弟子都已经成器。¤The elders and disciples on and off the stage have all come into their own.
以你的炼器造诣，区区符器不在话下，所有步骤都在按部就班的进行，之后便没有什么意外的顺利成器了。¤With your refinement attainments, a mere talisman weapon is not a problem. All the steps are being followed step by step, and after that there is no surprise that the weapon will be completed smoothly.
之后，在长老的指点下融化的材料逐渐听话起来开始粘合在一起。¤After that, the melted materials gradually obeyed the elders' instructions and began to be glued together.
你看到不少本门弟子陆续前来参加炼器大会。¤You see quite a number of our disciples coming one after another to attend the Weapon Making Conference.
同门之间互相帮助也是应该的，再说她这个炸弹要是爆开来我也要遭殃呢。¤It's only right that we help each other, and if she explodes this bomb, I'll be in trouble too.
虽然万宝阁东西很多，但真的“好东西”还得要来这里啊。¤Although there are many things in Wanbao Pavilion, really good things have to come here.
千流岛功法虽强，但据我所知岛上规矩也多得很，并没有碎星岛和蓬莎岛来得自在。¤Although Qianliu Island exercises are strong, as far as I know, there are many rules on the island, and there is no such thing as Broken Star Island and Pongsha Island.
何为仙真，只在逍遥，道在心中，但求痛快！¤What is immortal truth, only in Xiaoyao, Tao is in the heart, but please be happy!
临行前掌门曾嘱托我寻找千年前于古迹中失踪的衍复长老，不过长老失踪已有千年，我担心...唉......¤Before I left, the headmaster once asked me to look for the elder Yanfu who disappeared in the monument thousands of years ago, but the elder has been missing for a thousand years, I am worried... alas...
传闻宁州古迹乃为上古正魔大战的主战场，其内定有许多大能残存的剑意。若机缘之下体悟此等剑意，定令我等获益匪浅。¤It is rumored that the ancient ruins in Ning Province are the main battlefields of the ancient Zhengmo wars. There are many powerful surviving sword intents in it. If we realize this sword intent under the opportunity, I will definitely benefit a lot.
万年前一战令魔修四把魔剑沦落各地，真想见识一下那魔剑究竟何等威力。¤Ten thousand years ago, a battle caused the four magic swords of evil cultivators to fall everywhere. I really want to see how powerful that demon swords is.
小子，看看有什么想要的？¤Boy, see what you want?
嗨，像你这样的，我来东石谷每天都要见到百八十个呢。只不过，真正能成正果的又有几个呢……¤Ha, I see about a hundred and eighty cultivators like you every day when I come to East Stone Valley. But how many of them can really achieve positive results well who can say...
修仙一途只有适合，没有最好。而最适合道友你的嘛……全在这里了！¤On the journey of cultivation, there is only suitable, there is no best. And the most suitable methods for you fellow Taoist... are all here!
灵气护罩，聚气疗伤，正适合客官您这样初出茅庐的青年才俊！¤Spiritual Shield, Gathering Qi to heal injuries, are suitable techniques for a fledgling young cultivator like you, esteemed customer!
原来是化尘教的{FirstName}长老，今日一见果真道骨仙风，有大家之范。¤It turned out to be the {FirstName} elder of the Aeonic Sands Temple. Today, when I saw Guozhen Dao Bingxianfeng, he was like everyone.
原来是竹山宗的长春长老，久仰大名，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤Ah, it is Lord Eternal Spring of the Bamboo Mountain Sect. Your fame preceeds you. If we find each other in the ruins, let us watch each other's backs.
原来是离火门的{FirstName}长老，今日一见果真道骨仙风，有大家之范。¤It turned out to be the {FirstName} elder from the Heavenly Fire Gate. Today, I saw Guozhen Daoxian Feng, like everyone.
这是自然，{$TmpTalkString}言重了，我倒是还有一事，烦请{$TmpTalkString}相助。¤That's natural, {$TmpTalkString} is too kind, I do have one more thing to ask {$TmpTalkString} for help.
宁州古迹横亘万年时光，不知其内是否能存在我宗门于历史中遗失的功法。¤Ning Province's historic sites have spanned thousands of years. I don't know whether there can be any exercises lost in history by our sect.
我派不少的功法传承由于年代久远有所缺失，现在已经失传了。¤Many of the practice inheritances that Our Sect have been lost due to ages, and now they have been lost.
原来是长春长老。许久未见，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤So it is Elder Changchun. I haven't seen you for a long time, so if we meet in the monuments this time, please take care of us.
宁州古迹横亘万年时光，希望其内能存在我宗门于历史中遗失的功法。¤Ning Province's historic sites have spanned tens of thousands of years. I hope that there will be in them the techniques that our sect has lost in history.
希望{FirstName}道友也能在宁州古迹中觅得自己的机缘。¤Hope {FirstName} fellow Daoists can also find their own opportunities in the historic sites of Ning Province.
{$TmpTalkString}此番若是能在古迹中找到什么有关我派功法传承的线索，还请帮忙留意一番。¤{If you can find any clues about our school's gongfu heritage in the monuments this time, please help keep an eye out for them.
希望{$TmpTalkString}也能在宁州古迹中觅得自己的机缘。¤I hope that {$TmpTalkString} will also find its chance in the Ning Province monuments.
原来是{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}，今日一见果真道骨仙风，有大家之范。¤Ah, it's {FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}, now that I've finally met you, indeed you walk with the air of a master.
原来是星河剑派的{FirstName}长老，今日一见果真道骨仙风，有大家之范。¤It turned out to be the {FirstName} elder of the Galaxy Sword Sect. Today, I saw Guozhen Dao Bingxian Feng, like everyone.
长春长老但说无妨。¤Speak freely Elder Eternal Spring.
原来是金虹剑派的{FirstName}长老，今日一见果真道骨仙风，有大家之范。¤It turned out to be the {FirstName} elder of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect. Today, when I saw Guozhen Dao Bingxianfeng, he was like everyone.
不错的灵力，这头推山兽绝非普通的筑基期妖兽实力，要小心应对！¤Not bad spiritual power, this push Mountain Pushing Beast is definitely not an ordinary base-building monster beast strength, you have to deal with it carefully!
阴风怒号，浊浪排空，日星隐曜，山岳潜形......\r\n一盏茶，一柱香的功夫，大半个宁州便被笼罩在这滚滚浓云之下。¤The gloomy wind is roaring, the turbid waves are emptying, the sun and stars are hidden, and the mountains are submerged ...... \r\n a tea, a column of incense, half of Ning Province was enveloped under these rolling thick clouds.
伴随着地裂山崩般的一声炸雷，酝酿许久的墨云霎时之间疯狂起来，好似惊涛骇浪一般，向着四面八方翻涌而去，迅速遮蔽了整个天空，浩浩汤汤，无边无际......¤With an explosive thunderclap like a cracking of the earth, the long-brewing ink clouds suddenly went wild, like shocking waves, surging in all directions, quickly covering the entire sky, vast and boundless ......
先是几道似有似无的雷鸣之声，由远及近，墨黑的浓云缓缓凝聚。¤First, there were a few sounds of thunder that seemed to come from afar, as thick, inky black clouds slowly coalesced.
小友功力深厚，我也是佩服的很啊。¤I admire you for your profound strength, too.
哈哈哈，痛快！痛快！¤Hahahaha, painful! Ouch!
你望向远处——这里除了你之外，竟然还有一名人类修士。¤You look into the distance - here, in addition to you, there is a human cultivator.
就算本座答应帮你，又有什么好处？¤Even if this seat agrees to help you, what good will it do?
我天生便是玄阴绝脉，正常的修炼之地并不适合我，反倒是待在这阴诡地狱之中要自在一些。¤I was born with the Xuan Yin vein, the normal cultivation place is not suitable for me, rather stay in this insidious hell to be more comfortable.
你没有跟他废话，直接运起功法向他攻去。¤You didn't talk nonsense to him, and directly attacked him with your kung fu.
道友可有改变主意？¤Have you changed your mind?
他所说的确不无道理，但这与他别有图谋也并不冲突。¤His words are indeed not without merit, but this does not conflict with his ulterior motives.
我这有一颗避阴珠，道友只管拿着此珠，看准机会潜入气旋便是，我自会掩护你，道友莫要担心。¤I have a Yin avoidance bead, you just take this bead, see the opportunity to dive into the cyclone is, I will cover you, do not worry.
前辈可有改变主意？¤Has the seniors changed their minds?
该不会是故意离间我与岛主，自己却别有用意？¤It is not intentionally separated from me and the island master, but their own ulterior motives?
……你若改变了主意，再来找我便是。¤...... If you change your mind, come back to me.
若你准备妥当，直接潜入那阴气旋便是，届时我自会掩护你。¤If you're ready, just dive into that Yin Qi whirlpool, and I'll cover you then.
该说的也都说完了。此事，道友意下如何？¤What needs to be said has also been said. This matter, what do you think?
…好，我考虑考虑。¤...Okay, I'll think about it.
据说这秘术的使用条件非常苛刻，需要等待一个特殊的时间。当然，这只是岛主自己的说辞...¤It is said that the conditions for the use of this secret technique are very harsh and requires waiting for a special time. Of course, this is only the island master's own words...
你可曾想过，岛主要那么多神阴石作甚？¤Have you ever wondered what the island wants so many divine Yin stones for?
岛主在这种事上说谎究极是想掩盖什么？¤What is the Island Lord trying to cover up by lying about such matters?
不错，只是你想让本座如何帮你？¤Not bad, but how do you want this seat to help you?
这气旋有专人把守，在下始终没能找到机会进去探查一番。¤The qi spiral is guarded, so I never got the chance to go in and check it out.
道友修为不俗，想必岛主已经将那几个任务交代给你了吧。¤Daoist cultivation is not bad, I think the island master has already explained those few tasks to you.
原来你是为此而来...¤So that's why you're here...
我天生玄阴绝脉，若不像这样寻觅些机缘，恐怕寿元早就耗尽了。¤I was born with the Xuan Yin extinct vein, if I didn't seek some chance like this, I'm afraid my life span would have been exhausted long ago.
前辈不知，在下天生便是玄阴绝脉，正常的修炼之地并不适合在下，反倒是待在这阴诡地狱之中要自在一些。¤I was born with the Xuan Yin vein, so a normal place of cultivation is not suitable for me.
既然道友已然推辞掉他们的任务，我便信得过道友了，说说倒也无妨。¤Since you have already resigned from their mission, I trust you, there is no harm in talking about it.
修仙本就是逆天而行…¤Cultivation of immortality is to go against the heavens...
道友可曾想过，这阴气气旋究竟从何而来？¤The actual fact is that you have ever wondered where this yin qi cyclone came from?
在岛上，不仅那秘术需要神阴石换得，借助阴气旋修炼也需要缴纳神阴石。¤On the island, not only does that secret art require divine yin stones in exchange, cultivation with the help of yin qi spiral also requires payment of divine yin stones.
此乃避阴珠，道友拿着此珠，便可隔绝阴气困扰。¤This is the Yin avoidance pearl. If you take this pearl, you can isolate yourself from Yin Qi.
只要前辈答应帮我，我自有方法拖住这些魂体。¤As long as seniors promise to help me, I have my own way of holding back these souls.
你表面上附和他，实际上却在暗自思忖。¤You superficially attached to him, but in fact in secret thoughts.
你向那人走去，他似乎并没有注意到你，只是在那通天的阴气旋前闭目修炼。¤You walk toward the man, he did not seem to notice you, just in front of that through the sky of the Yin Qi whirl closed eyes cultivation.
倘若气旋本就是岛主创造的，还有人会相信“气旋是为了供魂体修炼用”这种鬼话吗？¤If the cyclone had been created by the island master, would anyone believe the nonsense that the cyclone is for the cultivation of the soul?
届时前辈只需潜入气旋拿到宝物即可。¤At that time the seniors will only have to dive into the cyclone to get the treasure.
那关于这宝物，你可有什么头绪？¤So, do you have any clue about this treasure?
你跟本座讲条件？¤You're making a deal with me?
前辈可曾想过，这阴气气旋究竟从何而来？¤Has the senior ever wondered where this cyclone of Yin energy comes from?
还是先去幽冥海与玄冥海看看情况再做决断吧。¤Or go to the Underworld Sea and the Xuanmian Sea to see the situation before making a decision.
你感受到他的神情有一丝决绝。¤You sense a hint of determination in his demeanor.
道友既非阴魂，也需要借此阴气旋修炼？¤Daoist is not a yin soul, but also need to use this yin air spiral to cultivate?
他没有再作更多解释，而是意味深长地看了你一眼。¤He did not give more explanation, but gave you a meaningful look.
道友在此修炼多年，可曾了解过逆天造化术？¤Fellow Daoist has been cultivating here for many years, have you ever understood the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique?
该说的也都说完了。此事，前辈意下如何？¤What has been said has been said. What do you think of this matter, senior?
依我看，那复生之法多半也是子虚乌有。即便是有，也定然大有问题。¤From my point of view, the method of resurrection is most likely also false. Even if there is, there is certainly a big problem.
原来前辈是为此术而来，敢问前辈可有何疑问？¤So this is why you are here, do you have any questions?
这气旋有专人把守，我始终没能找到机会进去探查一番。¤This cyclone is guarded by a person, I never found the opportunity to go in and explore.
道友既然要去那里替他们办事，大可一探究竟。相信有心探索之下，一定会对这里有新的认识。¤The first thing you can do is to go there and work for them, so you can explore. I believe that with the intention to explore, you will definitely have a new understanding of the place.
只要道友答应帮我，我自有方法拖住这些魂体。¤As long as you promise to help me, I have my own way to stall these soul bodies.
以前辈的实力，剩下的自然都不是问题。¤With the strength of the seniors, the rest is naturally no problem.
倘若气旋本就是岛主创造的，你还会相信“气旋是为了供魂体修炼用”这种鬼话吗？¤If the cyclone was created by the island master, would you still believe in such nonsense as 'the cyclone is for the soul body to cultivate'?
道友准备好之后，直接潜入气旋便是。¤When you are ready, dive directly into the cyclone is.
难道不是为了维持气旋所用？¤Is it not used to maintain the cyclone?
依我看，这气旋下定有极阴的宝物存在。岛主搜集这么多神阴石，大抵便是滋养宝物之用。¤In my opinion, there must be extremely Yin treasures present under this cyclone. The island master collected so many divine yin stones, probably to nourish the treasures.
自然是为了隐瞒这气旋的真实来历。¤Naturally, it is to conceal the true origin of this cyclone.
这…难道并非天然形成？¤This...is not a natural formation?
恐怕是想利用这些魂体帮他收集神阴石。¤I'm afraid that I wanted to use these souls to help him collect the Divine Yin Stone.
道友只要小心一些，这些全然都不是问题。¤Fellow Daoist just need to be more careful, all these are not a problem.
其实，这阴魂岛并非从上古流传下来，而是由岛主一手创建的。¤In fact, this Yin Soul Island is not handed down from the ancient times, but created by the island master.
其中利弊，道友便自行思量吧。¤The advantages and disadvantages of this, you can think about it yourself.
你打算如何获取这宝物？¤How do you intend to acquire this treasure?
不是为了维持气旋所用？¤Not to maintain the cyclone used?
岛主对外宣称“这座岛是上古流传下来的”，便是彻头彻尾的谎言。¤The island owner claimed that 'this island is handed down from the ancient times', which is an outright lie.
也罢，本座便不计较了。¤So be it, I'll let it go.
老头，依你之见，此人说的是真是假？¤Old man, in your opinion, this person is true or false?
……前辈若改变了主意，可随时告知在下，在下会一直在此等候前辈。¤...... Seniors can always let me know if they change their mind, and I will always be here waiting for them.
所以任何机会我都不会放过，哪怕要冒生命危险。¤So any opportunity I will not let go, even if I have to risk my life.
不过今日却不同以往。道友若肯助我，这气旋也不是没有机会探查一二。¤But today is different from the past. If you are willing to help me, the cyclone is not without opportunity to explore a couple of.
你想问些什么？¤What do you want to ask?
若你不帮岛主他们做事，我倒不是不能给你透露一二。¤If you don't help the island master and his people, it's not that I can't reveal a thing or two to you.
只见他意味深长地看着你，不再说话。¤Only to see him look at you meaningfully and no longer speak.
但…岛主在这种事上说谎究极是想掩盖什么？¤But...what is the islander trying to cover up by lying about such things?
在下天生玄阴绝脉，若不寻觅些机缘，恐怕还未突破，寿元便先耗尽了。¤I was born with the Xuan Yin vein. If I don't find some chance, I'm afraid I'll run out of life before I can break through.
事成之后，定然少不了道友的好处。在下游历多年，最不缺的便是天才地宝。¤After the event is completed, there will be no shortage of benefits for you. I have been traveling for many years, and what I don't lack is genius and treasure.
这气旋乃是源源不断的聚集阴气，又非向外输出阴气，怎可能需要投入神阴石来维持？¤The cyclone is a constant source of gathering Yin Qi, and not outward Yin Qi output, how can it be necessary to invest in the divine Yin stone to maintain?
没错，岛主若真有这复生之法，只需等时候到了自己用便是，何必大费干戈当个岛主，还将这秘法公诸于众。¤That's right, if the island master really has this method of reincarnation, just wait for the time to use it themselves, why bother to be an island master, but also the secret method to the public.
那岛主隐瞒这些又有何目的？¤What is the purpose of the island master to conceal this?
在下这有一颗避阴珠，前辈只管拿着此珠，看准机会潜入气旋便是，在下自会掩护前辈，¤I have a pearl here to avoid Yin, just take the pearl and watch for an opportunity to dive into the cyclone, I will cover you.
岛主每过一段时间，都要将收集到的神阴石送下去，所以这气旋本身应该没有太大危险。就算有危险，最多也就是岛主的一些小伎俩罢了。¤Every once in a while, the island master sends down the collected divine Yin stones, so this cyclone itself shouldn't be too dangerous. Even if there is danger, at most, it's just some trick of the island master.
他点了点头，从储物袋拿出了一颗黑色的石珠。¤He nodded and took out a black stone bead from his storage bag.
那人转过头，上下打量了你一番。你注意到了他阴阳异色的双瞳，与你一样。¤The man turned his head and looked you up and down. You noticed his yin and yang pupils of different colors, the same as yours.
说着，他从储物袋拿出了一颗黑色的石珠。¤With that, he took out a black stone bead from his storage pouch.
哈哈哈，道友既然这么问了，想必对于岛主所言确也将信将疑。¤Hahaha, since you ask this, I think for the island master's words will indeed also believe.
倒也不无道理…可他究竟有何图谋？¤That's not unreasonable...but what exactly is his plan?
不错，只是你打算如何出手？¤Not bad, just how do you plan to strike?
此乃避阴珠，前辈拿着此珠，便可隔绝阴气困扰。¤This is a pearl to avoid Yin. If you hold this pearl, you will be protected from Yin Qi.
这种极阴的宝物乃我急需，阁下就算拿去别处卖掉，出的价位也不可能比我更高。¤This kind of extremely yin treasure is my urgent need, you even if you take it to sell elsewhere, the price offered can not be higher than me.
相信其中有许多也是对前辈有用之物。¤I believe that many of these are also useful to the previous generation.
你打算怎么探查这阴气旋？¤How do you plan to explore this Yin Qi spiral?
我并没有恶意，只是初来乍到，对于这阴魂岛还是诸多不解之处，不知道友可否指点一二？¤I do not have any malicious intent, I am just a newcomer to the island, there are still many things I do not understand about Yin Soul Island, I wonder if you can give me a few pointers?
他看了你一眼，没有理睬你。¤He gave you a look and ignored you.
若前辈准备妥当，直接潜入那阴气旋便是。¤If the senior is properly prepared, he can dive directly into the Yin Qi whirlpool.
届时道友只需潜入气旋拿到宝物即可。¤Then you just need to dive into the cyclone to get the treasure.
前辈可曾想过，岛主要那么多神阴石作甚？¤Has it ever occurred to you that the island needs so many Divine Yin Stones for what?
那依你之见，他究竟有何图谋？¤So what, in your opinion, is he up to?
不帮他们做事？具体要如何？¤Not to help them work? How exactly?
也罢，本座便破例帮你一次罢。¤Well, I'll help you for once.
就算我答应帮你，又有什么好处？你不怕我拿着宝物一走了之？¤Even if I promise to help you, and what benefit? You are not afraid that I will take the treasure and leave?
你我所谋之事不同，我对这秘术也毫无兴趣。不过你既已从岛主那里问到了这本秘术，莫非还有什么其它疑虑？¤What you and I are planning is different, and I have no interest in this secret art. But since you have already asked for this secret art from the island master, do you have any other doubts?
…此事太过危险，我们有何必要冒这个险？¤...the matter is too dangerous, why do we have to take the risk?
前辈既然这么问了，想必对于岛主所言确也将信将疑。¤Since elder asked so, I think for the island master's words will indeed also believe.
反倒是吸引他们的注意力，需要制造足够的骚乱。万一下不了台，情况定然比潜入更加气旋凶险。¤Instead, it is to attract their attention and need to create enough commotion. In case you can't get off the stage, the situation is bound to be more cyclonic and menacing than diving in.
他没有再作更多解释，而是坚定地看了你一眼。¤He did not make more explanations, but firmly looked at you.
没想到在这里竟然还能遇见别的人类修士，倒正好向他打探一番，探探那逆天造化术的虚实...¤I didn't expect to meet another human cultivator here, but it's just right to poke around with him and explore the reality of the Heavenly Creation Technique...
阴魂岛究竟有何图谋，道友应该可以透漏一二了吧？¤What exactly is the plan of the Island of Yin Souls, you should be able to divulge a little bit, right?
到时你只需推辞这些任务，自然便算是不帮他们做事。¤When the time comes, you just need to resign from these tasks, naturally you will be considered not to help them.
若前辈不帮岛主他们做事，在下便将事情的来龙去脉都告知前辈。¤If elders do not help the island master and his people, I will tell elders all the ins and outs of the matter.
哦？此事对你而言并不安全，你有何必要冒这个险？¤Oh? This matter is not safe for you, why do you have to take this risk?
在下绝无此意，只是此事所涉隐秘甚多，若是被岛主知道，在下同样有性命之忧，所以只能出此下策。¤I have no intention to do so, but this matter involves a lot of secrets, if the island master knows, I am also in fear of my life, so I can only resort to this.
不过今日却不同以往。前辈若肯助我，这气旋也不是没有机会探查一二。¤But today is different from the past. If the elder is willing to help me, the cyclone is not without a chance to explore a couple of things.
你向那人走去，他似乎感受到了你的威压，随即起身向你作了一揖。你注意到了他阴阳异色的双瞳，与你一样。¤You walk towards the man, who seems to sense your intimidation, and then rises and gives you a bow. You noticed his yin and yang pupils of different colors, the same as yours.
事成之后，定然少不了前辈的好处。在下游历多年，最不缺的便是天才地宝。¤After the matter is completed, it is certain that the benefits of elder will be less. I have been traveling for many years, and the last thing I lack is genius and geological treasures.
玄冥海，幽冥海与这里不同，虽然也有许多魂体，但并非都来自阴魂岛。¤The Xuanxu Sea, the Underworld Sea is different from here, although there are also many soul bodies, but not all from the Underworld Island.
这气旋下不知道有什么危险，道友就这么让我下去，似乎有所不妥吧？¤I don't know what dangers are under this cyclone, so it seems inappropriate for you to let me go down, right?
前辈来此，不知有何吩咐？¤elder is here, what do you want to tell me?
道友乃人类之躯，也需要借此阴气旋修炼？¤Fellow Daoist is a human body, and also needs to use this Yin Qi whirl to cultivate?
道友可曾听说过逆天造化术？¤Have you ever heard of the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique?
听说有很多地下交易的秘市，参加的人要蒙面敛息隐藏身份，非常神秘。¤I heard that there are many secret markets with underground transactions. Participants have to cover their faces and hide their identities, which is very mysterious.
你们本就不是来化龙海域生事的，故此并不打算残害无辜。你收回手中的法宝，那龙族窜入海中，很快便不见了踪影。¤You didn't come to Dragonborn Sea to cause trouble, so you don't intend to harm the innocent. You take back the magic weapon in your hand, and the dragon clan rushed into the sea and soon disappeared.
你并不打算手下留情，一声尖厉的长啸过后，那龙族便没了生机。¤You don't intend to be merciful. After a piercing and long howl, the dragon clan loses its vitality.
情急之下，你收捏法诀就准备驱使神通发动攻击。¤The first thing you need to do is to get ready to attack by driving the Avatar.
我现在若是出现在林府中，难免被发现，然后抓回去严加看管。所以只能拜托{FirstName}道友帮我去调查一下了。¤If I appear in the Lin House now, it is inevitable that I will be discovered and then arrested and taken back under strict supervision. So I can only ask {FirstName} Daoist friend to help me to investigate.
你是何人？为何闯入我的居所？¤Who are you? Why did you break into my residence?
睁开眼时，却看见一个陌生的女性修士正在安静的看着你。不过下意识的神识探测后，你却完全无法发现她的神识波动，好似房中站的不过是一个逼真的傀儡。¤When I opened my eyes, I saw a strange female Vagrant Cultivator is quietly watching you. But after subconscious soul sense detection, you can not find her soul sense fluctuations at all, as if the room stood but a realistic puppet.
但若是急于搜集证据，难免被几位长老察觉。若是因此在林家爆发战斗，难得逃离不说，还容易引起警戒，之后要行动更是难上加难。¤But if I'm in a rush to collect evidence, it's inevitable that several elders will notice and if this causes a fight to break out, it'll be difficult to escape! Not to mention that they're already alert, making it even harder to act.
啊，可以么？¤Ah, is it possible?
林姑娘既有应对之策，那我也就放心了。¤I'm glad you have a plan to deal with this.
好，林姑娘便在此等我消息吧。¤The first thing you can do is to wait until you hear from me.
修仙已是逆天而为，吾辈修仙者岂能让他人安排命运，这个忙我帮定了！¤Cultivation of Immortality is already to go against the heavens, my generation of cultivators can not allow others to determine our fate, I've decided to help!
见状，她在原地坐下哭了起来。你也不关心是真是假，只是不想冒这个风险，干脆封闭了自己的五感，继续修炼。¤Seeing this, she sat down in place and cried. You also do not care whether it is true or not, just do not want to take the risk, simply closed their five senses and continue to cultivate.
刚才的法宝便是能在这方面助道友一臂之力。只要在进入林府之前用灵力激发法宝，纵是几位金丹长老也难以察觉行踪，之后只要不是正面撞上，就不必担心啦。¤The magic treasure I gave you just now is able to help you in this regard, as long as you activate it before entering the Lin Manor, even if several Golden Core realm cultivators scan with their Soul Sense, there is no need to worry.
既然道友已经了解了许多，那我就长话短说好了。¤Since you have understood a lot, I'll make it short.
危机感从心中骤然升起，你强行退出了修炼状态，将按功法在经络中游走的灵气逼回了丹田之中。¤The sense of crisis suddenly rose from the heart, you forced out of the state of cultivation, the aura that was traveling in the meridians according to the gong method was forced back into the dantian.
不过我怀疑是二长老和三长老中有人收了好处，这才执意要促成这次联姻。如果能搜集到相关证据，就能说服大长老暂延此次婚事。等父亲出关我就不用担心被逼着与那冲虚老鬼结成道侣啦。¤But I suspect that someone in the second and third elders received a benefit, which insisted on facilitating this marriage. If we can gather the relevant evidence, we can convince the Elders to postpone the marriage. I don't have to worry about being forced to make a Daoist couple with the old ghost of Chong Xu when my father comes out of the gate.
我有些事想找你帮忙，但看你在修炼，就没好意思打搅你...¤I had something I wanted to ask you for help with, but seeing that you were cultivating, I didn't feel like disturbing you...
不必担心。大长老{color=#d0380a}通羽上人{/color}一向关爱我和姐姐，若是能找上他，只要说清缘由，料想会关照{FirstName}道友一番。所以此行的目的便是去{color=#d0380a}长老堂{/color}向大长老寻求帮助，等道友回来后，我们再做下一步计划。¤no need to worry. The Great Elder {color=#d0380a}Master Tongyu{/color} has always cared about my sister and me. If you can find him, as long as you explain the reason, you can expect to take care of fellow Daoist {FirstName}. So the purpose of this trip is to go to the {color=#d0380a}Presbyterian Church{/color} to seek help from the Great Elder, and we will make the next step after fellow Daoists return.
凭我的微末修为当然做不到...不然你在这也见不到我了...¤With my meager cultivation of course I can't do it... Otherwise you wouldn't see me here...
我怀疑二长老和三长老中有人收了好处，这才执意要促进这次联姻。如果能搜集到相关证据，就能说服大长老暂延此次婚事。等父亲出关我就不用担心被逼着与那冲虚老鬼结成道侣啦。¤I suspect that some of the second and third generation elders have received benefits, which is why they insist on forcing this marriage. If we can collect evidence, I wont have to worry about becoming a dao couple with that freak Chongxu...
而另外两位长老，他们都肩负不同事务，不会在府中闲逛，无需担心。至于其他人，若是问起只需推诿是姐姐请你来府访问即可。¤As for the other two elders, they both have different tasks and will not hang out in the mansion, so there is no need to worry. As for the others, if you ask about it, you just need to excuse the elder sister and invite you to visit the government.
哦？不知林姑娘有何事？¤Oh? I wonder what Miss Lin wants?
哎？哎！等等！我没有恶意！¤Hey? Hey! Wait! I have no malice!
本想找他帮忙的，但城内没有他的气息，应该是被倪伯父带走了。我又没有其他可以信赖的人了，只能尝试向你求助了...¤I wanted to ask him for help, but there was no trace of him in the city, so he was taken away by Uncle Ni. I don't have anyone else I can trust, so I can only try to ask you for help...
细看之下，你发现眼前的女子确实与在林家见过的林沐雪有几分相似，便是放下了心中的戒备。但想起这林二小姐是从林府私逃出来的，若是跟她扯上关系，免不了有很多麻烦，又暗自多了几分防范。¤Under a closer look, you find that the woman in front of you does have some resemblance to the Lin Mu Xue that you have seen in the Lin family, so you let down your guard. But remembering that this second Miss Lin is a private escape from the Lin House, if you get involved with her, there will inevitably be a lot of trouble, and secretly a few more precautions.
林家擅长以神识查探，对此也是极为自信，因此只要能躲过神识探查，便不用再担心其他。¤The Lin Family is good at detecting with their Soul Sense, and is extremely confident in this, so as long as you can avoid Soul Sense detection, you wont have to worry about anything else.
道友可知这天星城中发生了何事才导致封城？¤Do you know what happened in the Heavenly Star City to cause the Cultivate of the city?
危机感从心中骤然升起，你强行退出了修炼状态，此前散于四肢百骸中的灵气也尽皆收归丹田之内。¤The sense of crisis suddenly rises from your heart, you forcefully exit the cultivation state, previously scattered in the limbs and bones of the aura also all collected in the Dantian.
让我一个{$Var}修士去面对几位金丹期的长老也太冒险了，林姑娘还是另找他人帮忙吧。¤I'm too risky to let a {$Var} Vagrant Cultivator face a few Jindan stage elders, Miss Lin should find someone else to help.
唔，怎么说比较好呢...总之就是我反对此次婚事，但有两位长老却极力促成，于是势弱的我就只好趁宾客俱在，几位长老放松戒备时逃出林府。¤Well, how to say it better... In short, I opposed the marriage, but two elders were trying to make it happen, so I had to take advantage of the guests, and a few elders relaxed their guard to escape from the Lin House.
哼，还不是林家几位长老逼我与星宫那一脸猥琐的家伙结为道侣。于是我先是表示顺从，等到长老们放松警惕去专心接待宾客时，用族中秘宝掩盖了气息，趁机溜出林府。却不知为何在离开天星城前就被发觉。¤Hmph, it's not that I wanted to become the dao companion of that lecherous-looking guy from the Star Palace. The elders tried to force me and I obeyed, so when they let down their guard to concentrate on guests, I used the clan's secret treasure to cover my breath and slip out of the manor. But somehow I was discovered before I could leave Star City!
倪兄确实有向我介绍过。¤Brother Ni did introduce to me.
噢...不过我原本所求也不是出城。¤Oh... But what I originally wanted was not to leave town anyways.
发现我跑了，他们能不急么。就只能趁我还没来得及出城去，赶紧下令封城咯。¤When they found out that I ran away, how could they not be anxious? So they ordered the city to lockdown before I could escape...
嘿嘿，这个嘛，既然找{FirstName}道友帮忙，我自然是有妙计应对。¤Hey, hey, I know this well, since I'm looking for daoist {FirstName} for help, I naturally have a good plan.
林姑娘？你不是...你在我房里干什么？¤The latter, though guessing something, had to send you out of the house after some apologies. Miss Lin? You are not... What are you doing in my room?
我是林家的二小姐林沐心，相信武陵城的那个傻子已经向你介绍过我了。¤I am the second young lady of the Lin family, Lin MuXin, I believe that fool from Wuling City has already introduced me to you.
睁开眼时，却看见一位女性修士正在安静的看着你。但你的神识扫过房间后却告诉你房内并没有第二个人，好似是眼前的女修只是个残影，完全没有神识波动。¤When you open your eyes, you see a female Vagrant Cultivator is quietly watching you. But your soul sense sweeps through the room and tells you that there is no second person in the room, as if the female Vagrant Cultivator in front of you is just a remnant, with no soul sense fluctuations at all.
但林府甚大，我又对其中结构不太熟悉，若是像头霜熊般在府内乱闯，恐怕也...¤But the Lin House is very large, and I am not familiar with its structure, so if I were to barge around the house like a frosty bear, I'm afraid I would...
确是如此，但也仅是知道林家与星宫联姻一事，至于天星城为何封城就是一概不知了。¤That's true, but only in regards to the matter of the Lin Family Marriage, I'm not sure why the Heavenly Star Palace s closed.
那我要如何帮助林姑娘呢？难不成是要带林姑娘出城去？¤So how do I help you Miss Lin? Is it hard to take you out of the city?
所以我们还是得从长计议。¤So we have to think long and hard about it..
但我现在若是出现在林府中，难免被发现，然后抓回去严加看管。所以只能拜托{FirstName}道友帮我去调查一下了。¤But if I show up in the manor now, I'll inevitably be discovered and taken back under close guard.. So I can only ask fellow daoist {FirstName} to help me investigate.
只是没想到我极力掩盖行踪，还是在溜出天星城之前就被他们发现。结果你也看到了...¤I just didn't expect them to find me before I slipped out of the Heavenly Star City even though I tried my best to cover my tracks. As you can see, the result...
林沐心摆出一副楚楚可怜的样子看着你，但你却是不为所动。¤Lin MuXin put on a pitiful look and looked at you, but you were unmoved.
{FirstName}道友既是与倪家那个傻子一同来林府观礼，想必对天星城发生的事有一些了解了。¤Daoist {FirstName}, since you came to the Lin manor to observe the ceremony with that fool of the Ni family, you must have some understanding of what's going on in Star City.
对方似乎是天机阁修士，见到你过来，停下来{SayStcVal=924}地看着你。你决定...{w}{w=0.5}¤The other party seems to be the cultivator of Heavens Secrets Pavilion. Seeing you come over, I stopped {SayStcVal=924} and looked at you. You decide...{w}{w=0.5}
我也不是很了解附近的近况。¤I don't know much about the current situation nearby.
走？{xiaozi}留下吧。¤Go? {xiaozi} stay.
对方{SayStcVal=924}地看着你，不想与你交易，你决定离开。¤The other party {SayStcVal=924} looks at you, not wanting to deal with you, you decide to leave.
道友，何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤Friends, what's the matter? {w}{w=0.5}
对了，天机阁家大业大，这执事多半不是庸人，{xiaozi}你自己小心行事。¤By the way, the Heavens Secrets Pavilion family has a lot of work, and most of this deacon is not a mediocre person. {xiaozi}, be careful by yourself.
那就不多打扰道友了。¤Then don't bother fellow Daoists much.
你能感知到，对方是金丹后期修士。你决定...{w}{w=0.5}¤You can perceive that the opponent is a late-stage Golden Core cultivator. You decide...{w}{w=0.5}
{xiaozi}，有事？{w}{w=0.5}¤{xiaozi}, something?{w}{w=0.5}
只见他，服用了数瓶丹药。¤I saw him, taking a few bottles of pills.
这天机令道友收好，道友可凭此参加我天机阁拍卖会。¤On this occasion, fellow daoists can take it away, so that fellow daoists can participate in my Heavens Secrets Pavilion auction.
看来，已经有人邀请过道友了，那我就不多做打扰了。¤It seems that someone has already invited fellow daoists, so I won't bother too much.
应该是天机阁的执事，一般是行走于世间搜集宝物与人交易。¤It should be the deacon of Heavens Secrets Pavilion, who usually walks the world to collect treasures and trade with people.
你拿出信物对他示意。¤You take out the token to signal to him.
前辈，可有吩咐？{w}{w=0.5}¤Senior, do you have orders? {w}{w=0.5}
道友找我，还有别的事吧？¤Fellow Daoist is looking for me, is there anything else?
对方似乎松了一口气，小心翼翼地和你道别。¤The other party seemed to be relieved and bid you farewell cautiously.
对方虽有顾忌，但还是同意与你交易。¤Although the other party has scruples, he still agrees to trade with you.
道友不妨前去看看，说不定大有收获。¤Friends of Taoism might as well go and take a look, maybe you will be rewarded a lot.
对方的气息远强于你，你不敢细细查探。你决定...{w}{w=0.5}¤The other party's breath is much stronger than you, so you dare not check it carefully. You decide...{w}{w=0.5}
我天机阁收集天下奇珍异宝，每10年一届，举办拍卖会。金丹期以上修士皆可参加。¤My Heavens Secrets Pavilion collects the world's rare treasures, and holds an auction every 10 years. All cultivators above the Jindan period can participate.
同时也会举办修士集会，交流修炼心得，交易物品。¤At the same time, a gathering of cultivators will be held to exchange training experience and trade items.
(不愧是天机阁的人，还真是出手壕气啊。)¤(As expected of the Heavenly Secret Pavilion, they are really stunned.)
抱歉，要事在身。¤Sorry, it's up to you.
哼！敢对我天机阁的人动手。¤Huh! Dare to do something to the people in my Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
道友，可听说过我天机阁拍卖会？¤Friends, have you heard of my Heavens Secrets Pavilion auction?
唉？那边是？老头你知道是谁吗？¤Huh? It's over there? Old man, do you know who it is?
走？{xiaozi}拿命来。¤Go? {xiaozi} take his life.
嗯，我明白了。¤oh, I understand now.
金虹剑派掌门正要接过，却被一位身着淡金色衣袍的修士截入手中。¤The Golden Rainbow Sword Sect leader was about to take it when a cultivator in pale gold robes intercepted it into his hands.
多谢白鹿师兄，那我这便告辞了。¤Thank you, Brother White Deer, then I will take my leave now.
多谢师祖，那我这便告辞了。¤Thank you very much, Master, then I will take my leave now.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来邀请白鹿师祖届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to invite the White Deer Master to come and observe the ceremony at that time.
{FirstName}道友，请问此番光临我派有何贵干？¤{What is the purpose of your visit to our school?
竟是{FirstName}前辈亲自登门，请问此番有何贵干？¤What is the purpose of this visit?
你将请帖从储物袋中取出，随手丢向对方。后者则是恭敬地将之接在手中。¤You take the invitation out of your storage bag and casually throw it at the other person. The latter, in turn, respectfully takes it in his hands.
金虹剑派的大殿一时间陷入寂静之中。¤The Great Hall of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect fell into silence for a while.
眼看白鹿真人眉头紧皱，金虹掌门也不敢出声打扰，而你更是没甚么开口的必要，只是在等着他看完请帖后发话。¤Seeing the frown on the brow of the real White Deer, the Golden Rainbow Sect did not dare to make a sound to interrupt, and you had little need to speak up, just waiting for him to read the invitation and then give his word.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来贵派邀请白鹿道友届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension, and has asked me to come to your school to invite Fellow Daoist White Deer to observe the ceremony at that time.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来邀请白鹿师兄届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to invite Brother White Deer to come and observe the ceremony at that time.
见过白鹿师祖。¤Meet the White Deer Master.
此人也不言语，只是点了点头表示回复，而后便开始认真检查请帖的内容。¤The man did not say a word, but merely nodded in reply, and then began to examine the contents of the invitation in earnest.
{FirstName}师祖，今日这是...？¤{FirstName}Sifu, today this is...?
{FirstName}{shidi}，今日这是...？¤{FirstName}{shidi}, today this is...?
多谢白鹿道友，那我这便告辞了。¤Thank you, Fellow Daoist White Deer, then I will take my leave now.
多谢白鹿前辈，那我这便告辞了。¤Thank you, Senior White Deer, then I will take my leave.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来贵派邀请白鹿前辈届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to come to your school to invite Senior White Deer to observe the ceremony at that time.
炼丹长老能够以更低的价格在门派内购得草药资源，以精进自身丹道。¤Alchemy elders can purchase herbal resources in the martial arts at a lower price to improve their own alchemy.
只见{$zhangmen}与各位长老们面面相觑，用不可思议的眼神看着你。¤I saw {$zhangmen} looking at each other with the elders, looking at you with incredible eyes.
只见掌门与各位长老们面面相觑，然后纷纷摇头叹息。¤I saw the head and the elders looking at each other, and then shook their heads and sighed.
多谢{$zhangmen}。¤Thank you {$zhangmen}.
开辟洞府，自然是选择灵气越浓郁的地方越好，这样对未来闭关修炼时的速度大有益处。¤To open a cave, it is natural to choose a place with richer spiritual energy, as this will greatly benefit the speed of retreat in the future.
炼丹长老负责掌管门派炼丹房，定期组织普通弟子，或是亲自为门派炼制所需的丹药。¤The alchemy elder is in charge of the sect alchemy room, regularly organizes ordinary disciples, or personally refines the required Pill for the sect.
另外，金丹期长老就有权在我派的驻守范围内自行开辟洞府进行修炼了。¤In addition, the elders of the Golden Core Stage have the right to open up caves for cultivation on their own within the scope of my garrison.
不同职位的长老职责不同，权利与俸禄也不相同，师侄可以按照自己的特长与需求进行选择。¤Elders in different positions have different responsibilities, and their rights and salaries are different. Nephews can choose according to their own strengths and needs.
我派长老按职责不同，分为授业长老，外务长老，炼丹、炼器长老以及挂名长老。¤I send elders according to their responsibilities, and they are divided into elders of the profession, elders of foreign affairs, elders of alchemy, refining tools, and named elders.
授业长老需负责指点门派内门子弟，并定期举办讲法。¤The teaching elders are responsible for guiding the inner sect children of the sect and holding regular lectures on the Fa.
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为授业长老恐怕不能服众。¤With your reputation in the clan, I'm afraid that if you become an Ordained Elder you won't be able to convince the public.
{FirstName}师侄能够在200岁前顺利结丹，总算是渡过了这个难关。¤{FirstName} Martial Nephew was able to smoothly condense the pill before the age of 200, and finally overcame this difficulty.
炼器长老负责掌管门派神兵阁，定期组织普通弟子，或是亲自为门派炼制所需的法宝。¤The refining elder is in charge of the sect's Shenbing Pavilion, regularly organizing ordinary disciples, or personally refining the magic weapons needed for the sect.
不过若是耽误了宗门要务，你在宗门的声望也会遭受损失的。¤But if you delay the important affairs of the sect, your reputation in the sect will also suffer a loss.
这...倒也不算太糟，若是未来有些别的机缘，师侄还是有望再进一步的。¤This...it's not too bad. If there are other opportunities in the future, Shi Nephew is still expected to go further.
唔...{shidi}对于炼器一道的造诣恐怕还无法胜任我派炼丹长老一职。¤Well... {I'm afraid that I'm not yet competent to serve as an alchemist elder in my school.
见过{$zhangmen}。¤I have seen {$zhangmen}.
师侄这般资质，可万万不可荒废。说不定数百年后，我派又能多一个元婴实力的长老啊。¤Senior nephew's qualifications must not be abandoned. Maybe hundreds of years later, I will send another elder with the strength of Nascent Soul.
当然，挂名长老没有其它的实权，所能获得的俸禄也会相应的低上许多。¤Of course, the named elders have no other real power, and the salary they can get will be correspondingly much lower.
炼器长老能够以更低的价格在门派内购得各类材料，以精进自身器道。¤The refining elder can purchase all kinds of materials in the martial art at a lower price to improve his own craftsmanship.
唔...{shidi}对于炼丹一道的造诣恐怕还无法胜任我派炼丹长老一职。¤Well... {I'm afraid that my attainment in alchemy is not good enough for the position of Alchemy Elder of my school.
你来到宗门大殿，只见门派内的诸位长老都悉数在场，{$zhangmen}站在大殿中央，正笑脸盈盈地看着你。¤When you came to the main hall of the Zongmen, all the elders in the clan were all present. {$zhangmen} was standing in the middle of the hall, looking at you with a smile.
好了...该说正事了。¤Okay...it's time for business.
{FirstName}师侄虽然刚刚晋入金丹期，但对于金丹期的修炼，乃至未来结婴所需做的准备想必还是一头雾水，陌生的很吧。¤Although {FirstName} Martial Nephew has just entered the Golden Core Stage, he is still confused about the cultivation of the Golden Core Stage and the preparations needed for future nascent soul. He is very unfamiliar.
外务长老负责驻守门派驻地，以及外出收集门派需求的资源等等事宜。¤The foreign affairs elders are responsible for guarding the sect's station and collecting resources needed by the sect and so on.
师侄你以后所若是想要担任其他长老，也可以来寻我，不过间隔时间需在50年以上。¤If you wish to serve as another Elder in the future, you may also come to me, but the interval must be at least 50 years.
{FirstName}师侄这般年纪还能够结丹成功，倒是大大出乎我们的预料，也算没有辜负师侄这些年来的努力。¤The ability of {FirstName} to be able to form a pill at such an age as Martial Nephew is far beyond our expectation, and it is considered that it has not failed Martial Nephew's efforts over the years.
哈哈哈，妙哉，妙哉。¤Hahaha, wonderful, wonderful.
授业长老能够以较低的价格在门派藏经阁内兑换各类秘籍，以提升自身修为与悟道。¤The elders can exchange all kinds of cheats in the sect Tibetan Scripture Pavilion at a lower price to improve their cultivation and enlightenment.
虽然杂事诸多且需及时处理，却也是门派内俸禄最高的职位。¤Despite the many chores and the need to deal with them in a timely manner, it is the most highly paid position in the sect.
呵呵，我就猜到你会这么选。¤Hehe, I guessed you would choose this way.
{FirstName}师侄能结成如此金丹，只要不遇到什么重大的变故，何愁大道不成啊！¤{FirstName} Martial Nephew can form such a Golden Core, as long as there is no major change, why not worry about the road!
不过若是{FirstName}师侄本就精通于布阵之道，以后也可以自己在洞府内布置更好的阵法。¤However, if the {FirstName} nephew is already proficient in the formation of formations, he can also arrange better formations in the cave in the future.
只见{$zhangmen}眉头微微一皱，似乎在考虑些什么...¤I saw {$zhangmen} frown slightly, as if thinking about something...
以后，宗门的重要事务都会以传音符的形式发放，师侄务必记得及时查看。¤In the future, important affairs of the sect will be issued in the form of sound transmission notes, so please remember to check it in time.
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为外务长老恐怕不能服众。¤Given your reputation in the clan, I am afraid that you would not be able to convince the public if you were to become an Outer Elder.
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为炼丹长老恐怕不能服众。¤With your reputation in the clan, I am afraid that you would not be able to convince the public if you were to become an Alchemy Elder.
{FirstName}师侄，如今你既然已经突破金丹，自然也该成为我派长老，享受和其他金丹期长老一样的待遇。¤{FirstName} Nephew, now that you have broken through the golden core, you should naturally become our elder and enjoy the same treatment as other golden core elders.
{FirstName}师侄修炼至今，似乎还不到150岁吧，真是前途不可限量。¤{FirstName} Martial Nephew has cultivated so far, it seems that he is less than 150 years old. The future is really limitless.
{$shanming}附近{$shuxing}属性灵气丰富，很适合我派修士修炼。一会儿师侄去神兵阁领取了开辟洞府需要用到的阵旗，就可以前往{$shanming}寻觅合适的洞府地点了。¤The nearby {$shanming} {$shuxing} has rich attributes and aura, which is very suitable for me to send cultivators to practice. After a while, my nephew will go to the Shenbing Pavilion to receive the flags needed to open the cave, and then go to {$shanming} to find a suitable cave. Location.
不知...{FirstName}师侄丹成几品？¤I don't know... what grade is {FirstName} Martial Nephew Dan Cheng?
挂名长老虽在门派内担负长老名位，但实际上没有什么俗事缠身，只是一种威慑的存在，最为自由。¤Although the named elders assume the position of elders in the sect, there is actually no mundane matter, they are just a deterrent and they are the most free.
{FirstName}师侄所言非虚？¤What the nephew {FirstName} said is true?
以你在宗门的声望，若是成为炼器长老恐怕不能服众。¤With your reputation in the clan, I am afraid that you would not be able to convince the public if you were to become a Weaponry Refining Elder.
这九品金丹可是传说中的存在，我派最近数千年来的记载中也无一人有此机缘啊。¤This Ninth-Rank Golden Core is a legendary existence, and no one in my records in the last thousands of years has this opportunity.
若师侄在这方面有任何问题，皆可向我请教，我定倾囊相授。¤If your nephew has any questions in this regard, you can ask me for advice, and I will give it to you.
宗门炼制有一些基础的聚灵阵旗，有了这些阵旗，即便是对阵道一窍不通之人也能布下阵法。¤Zongmen refining has some basic spirit gathering array flags. With these array flags, even people who don't know anything about the Dao can set up an array.
可惜，可惜...但总算是突破这层难关，总好过一辈子被困在筑基。¤It's a pity, it's a pity... but it is better to break through this level of difficulty than to be trapped in the foundation for a lifetime.
{FirstName}师侄修炼至今，似乎还不到100岁吧，真是不可思议。¤{FirstName} Martial Nephew has practiced so far, he seems to be less than 100 years old, it's incredible.
青玉符剑-主动：吸收1点灵气。冷却时间2回合。¤Green Jade Rune Sword - Active: Absorbs 1 point of Qi. Cooldown 2 rounds.
重浪针-主动：造成2段1点水系伤害。冷却时间1回合。¤Heavy Wave Needle - Active: Deals 2 instances of 1 point of water damage. Cooldown 1 round.
可是新来的小师妹？这里有三把供新弟子挑选的法器，师妹选一柄趁手的吧。¤Are you the new junior sister? Here are three magic weapons for new disciples to choose from, so choose one that you find fitting.
水灵剑-主动：造成6点水系伤害。冷却时间1回合。¤Water Spirit Sword - Active: deals 6 points of water damage. Cooldown 1 round.
这是你的法器与道袍，千万小心别弄丢了。¤This is your magic weapon and Taoist robe, be careful not to lose it.
你可别小看了天字杀手。¤You don't underestimate the skywriter.
如此一来，或许真的有机会让他自己露出马脚...¤In that case, there might be a real chance of him revealing himself...
你的消息还真是灵通。¤You're really well-informed.
他和你说了些什么？¤What did he say to you?
若是有了什么新的线索，及时告知我便是。¤If there are any new clues, just let me know.
这样也好，否则琚运琦若是交给你什么让你难以下手的悬赏，你恐怕会陷入两难的境地。¤This is good, otherwise if Ju Yunqi handed you some kind of bounty that would make it difficult for you to start, you would be in a dilemma, I'm afraid.
我告诉他，滥杀无辜并非明智之举。¤I told him that it was not wise to kill an innocent person indiscriminately.
好...说正事吧。琚运琦应该已经找过你了吧？¤Well... Let's get down to business. Ju Yunqi should have approached you already, right?
哈哈哈，他应该很满意这个答案。¤Hahaha, he should be happy with that answer.
既然你未曾取得琚运琦的信任，那与其冒险调查打草惊蛇，倒不如静观其变。¤Since you have not gained Ju Yunqi's trust, it would be better to wait and see what happens rather than risking an investigation that would alert the snake.
我告诉他，只要灵石到位，杀谁都一样。¤I told him that it was the same to kill anyone as long as the spirit stones were available.
依我看，他应该巴不得你对这长老会的权利毫无兴趣，做一个一心赚取灵石的杀手。¤In my opinion, he should not want you to have no interest in the power of this council of elders and be a killer who is bent on earning spirit stones.
除此以外就没有别的了，我也未曾发现什么与血剑宫有关的线索。¤Other than that there is nothing else, and I have not found any clues relating to the Blood Sword Palace.
据我所知，血剑宫近些年来与白帝楼多有纠葛。他们若还有什么大的动作，或许还会与琚运琦有所联系。¤As far as I know, the Blood Sword Palace has had many entanglements with the White Emperor House in recent years. If they have any more big moves, they might even have a connection with Ju Yunqi.
若说魔门的话，与古神教和天魔道有关的悬赏倒是有，与血剑宫有关的确是未曾见过。¤If we talk about the Demon Sect, there are bounties related to the Ancient God Sect and the Heavenly Demon Dao, but it is true that we have not seen any related to the Blood Sword Palace.
但总还是有些异常的，你在风雨楼接取了不少悬赏，可有曾发现过与血剑宫有关的悬赏？¤But there is still something unusual. You have taken many bounties at the Rain and Wind Tower, have you ever found any bounties related to the Blood Sword Palace?
你成为天字杀手，对于风雨楼虽是一件大好事，但对他而言毕竟多了一些不稳定的因素。¤Although it is a great thing for Rain or Shine House that you have become a Heavenly Character Killer, it is after all a little more unstable for him.
元婴期修士各有底牌，到了以命搏杀之时，即便修为高出一筹者也不敢说有必胜的把握，与那切磋较艺的天机大比不可同日而语。¤When it comes to fighting for their lives, even those with a higher level of cultivation dare not say they are sure of victory, and it is not the same as the Tianji Competition, which is a competition of art.
后面的事我会设法调查，若有了什么新的线索，我也会及时告知于你。¤I will try to investigate the latter and keep you informed if there are any new clues.
而能够完成天阶悬赏，杀死元婴期目标的天字杀手，几乎堪称是化神之下的最强战力了。¤And a Heavenly Word assassin who can complete a Heavenly Rank bounty and kill a target at the Nascent Soul stage can almost be considered the strongest combatant below the Deity Transformation.
{FirstName}{$daoyou}，恭喜你晋升为风雨楼天字杀手。¤{FirstName}{$daoyou}, congratulations on your promotion to the Weather House Heavenly Word Killer.
大名鼎鼎的{$daihao}，如今在风雨楼中可是无人不知，无人不晓了。¤The famous {$daihao} is now unknown to everyone in the Rain or Shine House.
血剑宫关系重大，琚运琦不会轻易就让别人发现明显的线索。¤The Blood Sword Palace has a great deal at stake, and Ju Yunqi will not easily allow others to discover the obvious clues.
但仅凭这个这也说明不了什么。¤But this alone this doesn't tell us much.
不过如此一来，再想获取他的信任是绝无可能了...¤But then, it would never be possible to gain his trust again...
风雨楼事宜，虽说需由长老会共同决断。但如今风雨楼中，琚运琦威望最甚，大小事宜皆是他一人说了算。¤Although it is said that the Elders' Council has to decide on matters of the Wind and Rain House, Ju Yunqi has the most prestige in the House. But nowadays, Ju Yunqi has the most prestige in the House and he alone has the final say on all matters.
他居然连此事都与你说了，看来对你已经有所信任...¤He even told you about it, so he seems to have some trust in you...
既然你已经取得了琚运琦的信任，那与其冒险调查打草惊蛇，倒不如静观其变。¤Since you have already gained Ju Yunqi's trust, it is better to wait and see what happens rather than risking the investigation and alerting the snake.
你是怎么答复他的？¤How did you reply to him?
以你我之间的交情，不必如此。¤With the friendship between you and me, there is no need to do so.
我所结交之人中，除你以外，恐怕再找不出第二人能够做到了。这次是我欠了你一份人情。¤I am afraid there is no other person I have ever befriended who could have done the same, except for you. I owe you a debt of gratitude this time.
况且本是普通散修的他，却突然富裕了起来，还结交不少好友。他确实有意无意中打听过有关倪府的消息，你这一说我就想起来了。¤Moreover, he, who was originally an ordinary, poor independent cultivator, suddenly became rich and made many friends. At one point he did inquire about the Ni family but I didn't remember until you asked just now.
好的。\n¤Good. \n
是的，每次英杰会我们都会相聚，那时我们正在喝酒，突然他面色很痛苦，也是在那时候他体内有这股气息的。¤Yes, every time the Young Hero's Competition comes around we drink together. At that time he suddenly had a painful look on his face and that's when I felt this strange Qi fluctuation in him.
武陵城因为英杰会是有各地修士来此，但近些时日确实是发生了一些不同寻常之事。¤Due to the Young Hero's Competition, Wuling City has been visited by cultivators from all over Ning Province, some unusual things have indeed been happening in recent times.
怎么，有可疑的陌生人打听倪家和白帝楼的事？¤Why? Was there a strange person asking about the White Emperor Pavillion and the Ni family?
我原以为他已无再进的可能，没想到今年他却突然突破至炼气巅峰，更是习得数门威力强大的法门，虽未获得魁首却也小出风头。¤I thought he would be stuck at this stage his whole life, but he suddenly broke through and acquired several powerful techniques.
客栈掌柜眼神微微一凝，随即面色恢复正常，低声说道。¤The inn shopkeeper's eyes narrowed slightly, then his complexion returned to normal, and he whispered.
白帝楼与倪家府邸附近总有陌生人出现，我特来调查此事。¤There are always suspicious people near the White Emperor Pavillion and Ni's mansion, I'm here to investigate this matter.
本来我也很替他高兴，但是今年我和他喝酒的时候，一次偶然间觉得他体内散发出某种气息，不像是正道功法。¤Originally I was very happy for him, but this year while we were drinking I noticed a strange Qi fluctuation in his body, which felt very unorthodox.
唉，你来晚了，他上个月就退房离去了。¤Alas, you are late, he checked out and left last month.
原来是白帝楼来人，不知有何吩咐？¤Ah, you turned out to be from the White Emperor Pavillion. I don't know what orders you have for me?
恰恰相反，是我熟识的一位老顾客，近来很是...¤On the contrary, it's an old customer I know well. Recently, they're acting very...
今年他正好39岁也是最后一次参加这个盛会了，但今年的他突破至炼气巅峰，更是习得数门威力强大的术法，虽未获得魁首却也小出风头。¤This year, he happened to be 39 years old, just away from the cut-off point of the competition. He suddenly broke through to the peak of Qi Refinement and learned several powerful techniques, although he didn't win he was still in the limelight.
但今年，李天对于倪家大少、家主的事格外上心，不过我们这些底层修士也没啥能告诉他的就是了。¤But this year, Li Tian is extra attentive to the matter relating to Ni family's mater and younge master. Though we low level cultivators have nothing to tell him really.
他现在就住在我这里...¤He lives with me now...
他的师傅也不过是一老道士，拿到一本残缺的《吐纳功法》。和您这样的青年才俊不同，我们这种散修一般能破先天入炼气已是福缘了，像是倪家、白帝楼这种顶流修仙势力，哪是我们应该关心的？¤His master is just an old Taoist priest, and he got an incomplete copy of Tu Na Technique. Unlike young talents like you, it is a blessing for us to break the innate and cultivate Qi as independent cultivators. Such as the Ni family, Baidilou and other top-level cultivators, what should we care about?
道友，要住店么？{w}{w=0.5}¤Friends, do you want to stay in this inn ? {w}{w=0.5}
带我去见见他吧。¤Take me to meet him.
直说了吧，此人名叫李天，原是这附近的一名散修，与我有几分交情。他虽机缘巧合之下突破至炼气中期，但多次参加英杰会比试都铩羽而归。¤To be frank, this man's name is Li Tian, originally he was an independent cultivator who operated around Wuling City. He coincidentally broke through to the Mid Qi Refining stage. He failed the Youth competition many times.
而且也就如你所说，本是普通散修的他，突然富裕了起来，结交不少好友，他对于倪家和白帝楼的上心程度也太诡异了，你这一说我就想起来了。¤And just as you said, he was originally an ordinary independent cultivator. He suddenly became rich and made a lot of friends. His sudden interest towards the Ni family and White Emperor Manor is too weird. I remembered.
直说了吧，此人名叫李天是逸风城附近的一名散修，虽机缘巧合之下突破至炼气中期，但种种原因影响已无再进的可能，前两届英杰会都是来碰碰运气，一来二去也算是我和熟识。¤To put it bluntly, this person's name is Li Tian, ​​who is a independent cultivator near Yifeng City. Although by chance, he broke through to the middle stage of refining Qi, but there is no possibility of further advancement due to various reasons. By some chance we got to know each other.

草药还没找回来吗？¤Have you found the herbs yet?
对了，我炼制的凝神丹还需{color=#d0380a}轻灵草{/color}、{color=#d0380a}天青花{/color}两味草药，麻烦{shidi}多走一趟了。¤By the way, I still need {color=#d0380a}Windborn Palm{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Azuresky Flower{/color} for the Mind Clearing Pill I am refining, so I will have to trouble {shidi} to make another trip.
唉，这家伙丹不炼成不出炼丹房，麻烦{shidi}帮个忙让他赶快炼好丹从我这儿出去吧......¤Hey, this fellow can't make a pill without making a pill, please {shidi} do me a favor and let him quickly make a good pill and get out of me...
多谢{shidi}的几次相助，这是我研究出的丹方，你拿去研究吧。¤Thank you {shidi} for your help a few times. This is the pill that I have researched. You can study it.
徐凡接过草药便丢进了丹炉，露出了如释重负的笑容。¤Xu Fan took the herbal medicine and threw it into the pill furnace, showing a relieved smile.
那便有劳{shidi}了。¤Then there will be trouble {shidi}.
徐凡守着炼丹炉，口中喃喃自语。¤Xu Fan muttered to himself while guarding the alchemy furnace.
去去去，没事别打扰我炼药。¤Go, go, don't bother me refining medicine.
你是新来的{shidi}？麻烦你帮忙找来{color=#d0380a}夜交藤{/color}和{color=#d0380a}天青花{/color}吧，我正在炼丹一时走不开。¤Are you the new {shidi}? Could you please help me find some {color=#d0380a}Nightryst Vine{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Azuresky Flower{/color}? I'm in the middle of synthesizing this Pill and can't leave.
多谢{shidi}。实不相瞒我准备将这些丹药送予一位朋友，女性修士想来更喜欢驻颜丹多些。¤Thank you {shidi}. To be honest, I am planning to give these pills to a friend. Female cultivators prefer Zhuyan pills if they want to come.
劳烦{shidi}最后帮我寻{color=#d0380a}玄冰花{/color}回来吧。¤Thank you {shidi} and lastly please help me find some {color=#d0380a}Clearfrost Petals{/color}.

天衍阁是我天机阁售卖情报玉简之所道友要事有兴趣探探秘境，不凡去看看。¤Tianyan Pavilion is the place where my Heavens Secrets Pavilion sells information jade slips. Daoists are interested in exploring the secret realm. Don't go and see it.
呼，这离火门卧虎藏龙，我还是先离开吧。¤Huh, this is a crouching tiger, hidden dragon from the Heavenly Fire Gate, I'd better leave first.
把这老头打晕再悄悄溜进去，速度得快一些以免他上告宗门......¤Knock this old man out and then sneak in quietly, faster to prevent him from suing the sect...
罢了，此次不伤你这{xiaozi}的性命，日后切莫再犯。¤I'm not going to hurt your {xiaozi} life this time, so don't do it again in the future.
今天就到此为止，去告诉赤发鬼 ，这些人的魂魄我们就收下了，桀桀桀桀桀...¤That's it for today, tell the Chi-Fa Ghost, we will accept the spirits of these people, Jie Jie Jie Jie Jie...
他奶奶的，哪里冒出来的{xiaozi}。¤His grandmother, where did {xiaozi} pop up.
桀桀桀桀，你今天表现的不错，以后你就算我们禾山道的人了，等回了山寨，少不了你的奖赏。¤Jie Jie Jie Jie, you performed well today. In the future, even if you are from Heshan Road, you will be rewarded when you return to the cottage.
不打了不打了...打跑一个又来一个，真是没完没了...¤If you don't fight, you won't fight...one after another, it's really endless...
妈的，快...快去叫人！¤Damn, hurry... go get someone!
你别看掌门师尊和几位长老们平时嘴上不说，但心里对这些虚名还是有几分看重的。{shidi}若是能在猎魔试炼中表现出色，说不定还能得到掌门师尊的嘉奖呢。¤From the outside the master Sect Leader and the elders won’t talk about it, but they still value these nominals in their hearts. If {shidi} can perform well in the demon hunting trial, maybe you can get it: the master's commendation.
那是自然，上一届的猎魔试炼便是由我带着其他筑基期的师兄妹们一起参加的。¤That's natural. The last demon hunting trial was attended by me and other brothers and sisters from the foundation building period.
这灵核这是各大门派争夺的一种重要资源，我们竹山宗也不例外。所以你收集到的所有灵核都可以在宗门内部换取其它你需要的东西。¤This spiritual core is an important resource that various sects compete for, and our Bamboo Mountain Sect is no exception. So all the spiritual cores you collect can be exchanged for other things you need inside the sect.
虽然我们竹山宗最后取得的名次不佳，但好在那次还没有人在里面丧命。¤Although our Bamboo Mountain Sect won a poor ranking in the end, fortunately, no one died in it.
你将{color=#d0380a}灵气消散的飞剑{/color}交给大师兄，并将自己在路上遭到剑灵袭击的事悉数告知。¤You hand over the flying sword{/color} with the dissipated spirit of {color=#d0380a} to the big brother, and tell you all about your being attacked by the sword spirit on the road.
此次能战胜地魔你功不可没，不愧是我竹山宗弟子！¤This time, you have contributed to the battle against the demon. You are indeed a disciple of my Bamboo Mountain Sect!
哎快来快来，那个师弟就是......（低声耳语）¤Hey, come on, that junior is... (whispering)
{shidi}伤势可痊愈了？若有不适还是回洞府多加修养，以免落下后患。¤{shidi} is the injury healed? If you feel unwell, you should return to the cave mansion for more training, so as to avoid future troubles.
魔门沉寂千年，只怕这次假借二弟之手取回戮仙剑的计划只是一个开端。¤The Devil's Gate has been silent for a thousand years, so I am afraid that this plan to retrieve the Immortal Executing Sword under the guise of my second brother is just the beginning.
一切安好，不知倪家主近期如何？¤Everything is fine, I wonder how Patriarch Ni is doing lately?
我知道你心中定有很多未解之惑，若有什么想知晓的来问我便是。¤I know you have a lot of unanswered questions, if you have anything you want to know, just ask me.
这宁州古迹虽隐迹于时空狭缝中，但每隔一千五百年左右便会在宁州出现，某些资质泛泛者可能终其一生都没有机会触摸到宁州古迹的大门。细细算来，大概{$TempValue}年后宁州古迹便会开启了。¤Although this ancient site of Ning Province is hidden in the gap of time and space, it will appear in Ning Province every 1,500 years or so. Some people with general qualifications may not have the opportunity to touch the gate of the ancient site of Ning Province in their lifetime. Calculating carefully, the historic sites in Ning Province will be opened in about {$TempValue} years later.
宁州古迹乃是上古时期大战后形成的战场残骸，因聚集的灵力过多造成了空间扭曲而鲜少现世，只有其灵力波动与大陆达成一致时才会在化尘教以北的荒漠中出现。¤The ancient ruins in Ning Province are the remains of the battlefield formed after the war in the ancient times. Because of the accumulation of spiritual power, the space is distorted, and they rarely appear in the world. Only when their spiritual power fluctuations reach an agreement with the mainland will they be located north of Aeonic Sands Temple. Appeared in the desert.
二弟他本性忠厚纯良，这次不知怎的中了古神教的阴谋诡计。倪府众人已把控住他，并押送至秘境治疗。¤The second brother is loyal and pure in nature. This time he was somehow caught in the conspiracy and tricks of the ancient gods. Everyone in the Ni Mansion has taken him under control and escorted him to the secret realm for treatment.
不过也不见得那掌门修习了魔门功法才如此猖狂...或许问题出现在剑身上。¤But it doesn't necessarily mean that the headmaster has practiced the magic gate technique to be so rampant... Maybe the problem lies with the sword.
我观{FirstName}小友心性可嘉，多年过去不受杂念侵扰，道心仍如初到武陵城那般坚定，很好，很好。希望你勿失本心，早日领悟道之法门。¤I think {FirstName}'s little friend has a commendable heart. For many years, he has not been disturbed by distracting thoughts. Dao Xin is still as firm as when he first arrived in Wuling City. It is very good and very good. I hope you will not lose your original heart and understand the method of Dao soon.
御剑门...让我想想......可是九嶷山之上的那个御剑门？¤Imperial Sword Sect...Let me think about it...but the Imperial Sword Sect above Jiuyi Mountain?
希望长老及供奉能够尽快祛除二弟体内的魔蛊，让他恢复本心。¤I hope that the elders and the guest elders can get rid of the magic gu in the second brother as soon as possible, so that he can restore his original mind.
{FirstName}小友别来无恙？¤{FirstName} don't come here without problems?
这处独立的小空间便是所谓的宁州古迹...后来宁州修士倾尽人力几经搜罗，几次进入古迹搜索，才觅得戮仙剑，交由武陵城中的白帝保管。而绝仙剑被魔修找回，诛仙剑与陷仙剑则下落不明。¤This small independent space is the so-called ancient site of Ning Province...Later, the cultivators in Ning Province exhausted their manpower to search for and search for the historic site several times before they found the Immortal Executing Sword, which was handed over to the Baidi in Wuling City for safekeeping. The fairy sword was retrieved by the evil cultivator, but the whereabouts of the Zhuxian sword and the trapped fairy sword are unknown.
倪家主沉吟片刻，像是在组织语言。¤Patriarch Ni pondered for a moment, as if organizing language.
我倪氏一族曾揣测这四把魔剑绝非凡物，心智不坚定之人会受其内魔气侵蚀，逐步堕入魔道。¤My family of Ni has speculated that these four magic swords are extraordinary things. People who are not firm in their minds will be eroded by their inner demonic energy and gradually fall into the magic way.
剑......？¤sword......?
万年前在宁州的那场正魔大战，当年的金虹剑派掌门凭借独到的剑意强行破阵，甚至破开了位面屏障，将整个区域卷入了另外一处小空间，四把魔剑也就此下落不明。¤During the great battle between good and evil in Ning Province ten thousand years ago, the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect leader back then forced his way through the formation with his unique sword intent, even breaking through the dimensional barrier and swept the entire area into another small space, leaving the four magic swords unaccounted for.
提起戮仙剑，就不得不说诛仙剑阵。此剑阵威力无穷，变幻莫测，阵法内幻境法术虚实相生，令入阵者心神动摇，若修为不足便会当场殒命。¤When you mention Immortal Executing Sword, you have to talk about Zhuxian Sword Formation. This sword formation is infinitely powerful and unpredictable. The illusion and reality in the formation are in the form of false and real spells, which will shake the minds of those who enter the formation. If the cultivation level is insufficient, they will die on the spot.
多谢倪家主。说来有件事在下十分在意，家主方才所言中的宁州古迹为何地？¤Thank you, Master Ni. There is one thing that I am very concerned about. What is the Ning Province monument that the Master mentioned?
据说御剑门掌门也是个惊艳绝伦的人物，可惜与魔门勾结落了个死无全尸的下场。¤It is said that the head of the Imperial Sword Sect is also a stunning figure, but it is a pity that colluding with the Demonmen resulted in a dead end.
这诛仙剑阵由四把魔剑构成，戮仙剑便是其中一把。其余则分别为诛仙剑。绝仙剑和陷仙剑。此四把剑各有所长，以任何一柄作为阵眼，皆可发挥不同妙用。¤This Immortal Punishing Sword Formation consists of four demonic swords, of which the Immortal Executing Sword is one of them. The rest are the Immortal Punishing Sword. The others are the Sword of Execution, the Sword of Extermination and the Sword of Trapping. Each of these four swords has its own strengths, and any one of them can be used as the eye of the formation to bring about different uses.
按往年的记录，这薄弱之处往往会出现在{color=#d0380a}岫络谷{/color}的附近，到时仅需靠金丹期修为便可打开通道，进入宁州古迹所在的那片空间。¤According to the records of previous years, this weakness often appears in the vicinity of {color=#d0380a}Xiuluo Valley{/color}. At that time, only the Jindan period cultivation base can open the passage and enter the Ning Province historic site. That piece of space.
宁州古迹中法宝灵器随处可见，除此之外，上古时期的大能也在其中留下了不少传承。历年来能够在其中获得传承的修士无一例外，皆成就造化，距化神一步之遥！¤Magical and spiritual artifacts can be seen everywhere in Ning Province historic sites. In addition, the great powers of ancient times have also left a lot of inheritance in them. The cultivators who have been able to obtain inheritance in it over the years, without exception, have all achieved good fortune, and they are one step away from being a Deity Transformation cultivator!
可以说只要获得宁州古迹中的传承，便打开了通往化神期的大门。不过在这古迹中传承多处于凶险之地，像是器灵纷杂的战场，灵力汹涌的深谷，凶兽遍地的密林...而且这些大能性格古怪，即使有幸寻得传承之地，也不知会面临怎样的考验。¤It can be said that as long as you obtain the inheritance from the ancient ruins in Ning Province, you will open the door to the Deity Transformation stage. However, the inheritance in this ancient ruins is mostly in a dangerous place, like a battlefield with multiple weapons and a deep valley with surging spiritual power. The dense forest full of beasts... and these powerful characters are weird, even if they are lucky enough to find a place of inheritance, they don't know what kind of test they will face.
我省得了，多谢倪家主的提点。¤I can save it, thanks to Patriarch Ni for the point.
多亏小友的天蝉灵叶，想必再有几日我便能恢复如初。¤Thanks to the young friend's Skyscada Leaf, I'm sure I will be able to recover in a few days.
正是，御剑门掌门曾在千年前的宁州古迹中误打误撞得到了一柄魔剑。他性格本就桀骜乖张，得了通天灵宝后愈发目中无人。与他知交的时任金虹剑派掌门闻讯前去劝说他，反倒被打出了九嶷山。¤Exactly, the Master of the Royal Sword Sect once obtained a magic sword by mistake in a Ning Province monument a thousand years ago. He was already an unruly and unruly man, and he became more and more unruly after acquiring a heavenly treasure. The then head of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect, who knew him well, went to persuade him, but was beaten out of Jiuyi Mountain.
宁州古迹看似是难得一见的福缘之地，但其中隐藏的危险与杀机足以令人万劫不复。机遇总是与风险并行，日后如有机会前往古迹，{FirstName}小友定要牢记这句话。¤Ning Province historic sites seem to be a rare place of good fortune, but the hidden dangers and murderous opportunities in them are enough to make people irresistible. Opportunities always go hand in hand with risks. If there is a chance to go to the historic sites in the future, {FirstName} kids must keep in mind This sentence.
你悄悄地打量着倪家主，他略显苍白的面庞上仍旧带着威不可侵的气势。看来倪府供奉们颇有手段，短短数十日时间便将倪家主的病象拔除干净。¤You look at Master Ni quietly, his slightly pale face still has an invincible aura. It seems that the Guest Elders of the Ni Mansion have quite a means to remove Patriarch Ni’s disease in just a few dozen days. .
自那以后，御剑门掌门性情大变，好杀喜伐。几大门派联手打探后终于确信御剑门掌门已弃明投暗，魔功大成，才有了后续剿灭御剑门之事。而那魔剑也随着御剑门掌门的陨落不知所踪。¤Since then, the Royal Sword Sect's master has changed his temperament, and is a killer and a fighter. After several sects joined forces to investigate the matter, they were convinced that the Sword Master had abandoned the light and turned to the dark side. The demon sword was also lost with the fall of the Sword Master.
上古时期，宁州古迹也算是一座较为繁荣的城池。后因成为正魔大战的主战场而衰败，整座城池也由于巨大的灵力引起空间塌陷，落入了时空乱流中。¤In ancient times, Ning Province's historic sites were considered to be a relatively prosperous city. Later, it declined because it became the main battlefield of the battle between the real and the demons. The entire city collapsed due to the huge spiritual power and fell into the turbulence of time and space.
这宁州古迹虽隐迹于时空狭缝中，但每隔千年左右便会在宁州的岫络谷附近出现，某些资质泛泛者可能终其一生都没有机会触摸到宁州古迹的大门。细细算来，大概{$TempValue}年后宁州古迹便会开启了。¤Although this ancient site of Ning Province is hidden in the gap of time and space, it will appear near the Xiuluo Valley in Ning Province every thousand years. Some people with general qualifications may not have the opportunity to touch the gate of the ancient site of Ning Province in their lifetime. Calculating carefully, the historic sites in Ning Province will be opened in about {$TempValue} years later.
今日多有叨扰，待家主痊愈之后我必定再来拜访。¤There is a lot of harassment today, and I will definitely come to visit again after the family master recovers.
怎么又是你？¤why is it you again?
{/t}额...先说一下，老夫我这相术可是祖师真传，所以看一次，要收你100块灵石。{/t}¤{/t}Uh... let me talk about it first, my old man, my physiognomy is a true biography of the ancestor, so I will collect 100 spiritual stones from you once I see it.{/t}
我看道友这一身修为，应是拜入了离火门的师门，老夫说的可对？¤I think Fellow Daoist's cultivation base should be worshipped as teacher from Heavenly Fire Gate. Is that what the old man said right?
只见他拿出一片翠绿色的残玉，神秘兮兮的拿给你看。¤I saw him take out a piece of emerald green residual jade and show it to you mysteriously.
道友不信也是正常，不过这玉佩可不是凡物，道友不妨亲自试试，用全力攻击这块残片，它定不会有任何损伤。¤It's normal for fellow Daoists not to believe it, but this jade pendant is not a mortal thing. Fellow Daoists might as well try it personally and attack this fragment with all their strength. It will definitely not cause any damage.
等等...这碎片倒是与上次在御剑门遗迹中捡到的那片有几分相像，没准还真属于同一块玉佩。¤Wait...this fragment is somewhat similar to the one found in the Imperial Sword Sect ruins last time, maybe it really belongs to the same piece of jade pendant.
那...那这次姑且就再信你一次。按你说的，2000灵石，这块玉佩残片就归我了。¤Then... Then I will believe you again this time. According to you, 2000 Lingshi, this piece of jade pendant belongs to me.
哼，那我便试上一试。¤Hmph, then I will give it a try.
咳咳...原来是这位道友，哈哈。¤Ahem...It turned out to be this fellow Taoist, haha.
我看道友这一身修为，应是拜入了竹山宗的师门，老夫说的可对？¤I think that the Taoist fellow's cultivation base should be worshipped by the master of the Bamboo Mountain Sect. Is this the old man right?
不管是不是钥匙，但定然不是凡物，也算值得一试。¤Whether it is a key or not, it is definitely not a thing, and it is worth a try.
这个，老夫突然想起来还有些别的事要处理，就先走一步了，咱们有缘再见。¤Well, the old man suddenly remembered that there are other things to deal with, so he should take a step forward, and we have a chance to see you later.
嗯...道友如今应是{$nianling}岁，修炼了{$year}年有余，修为刚到{$xiuwei}，对否？¤Yeah...you should be {$nianling} years old now, and have been practicing for {$year} for more than a year. He has just arrived at {$xiuwei}, right?
诸位过往道友，本仙人得祖师真传，预知前程，能断后世，且来看上一卦啊。¤Dear friends from the past, this immortal has obtained the true biography of the ancestor, foreseeing the future, and able to cut off future generations, let's take a look at the last trigram.
什么有事要处理，我看你分明是见到我心虚想走。¤If you have something to deal with, I think you clearly saw me want to leave.
顺为凡，逆为仙...¤Shun is the ordinary, the reverse is the fairy...
噢？原来是这位道友，老夫对你可是印象深刻啊。¤Oh? It turned out to be this fellow Daoist. The old man is really impressed by you.
即便你说的是真的，如果找不到洞府的具体位置，就算收集齐了这些碎片又有何用？¤Even if what you said is true, if you can't find the specific location of the Dongfu, what's the use of collecting all these fragments?
千年前宁州曾出过一赫赫有名的元婴期散仙，唤作涵虚仙人。此人不知用何法门，活了快两千年，一身修为通天，据说同境界之下罕有敌手。¤Thousands of years ago, Ning Province once came out of a well-known Yuanying stage Sanxian, called Hanxu immortal. I don't know how to use this person, he lived for almost two thousand years, and his cultivation is through the sky. It is said that he is rare under the same realm.
这位道友，老夫看你乌云盖顶，印堂发黑，面有死气，似有大凶之灾啊，不如请到一边，待我为你看上一相，如何？¤This fellow Daoist, the old man sees your dark clouds cover your roof, the hall is darkened, and your face is dead. It seems to be a catastrophe. Why don't you please come aside and wait for me to see you?
等等...这碎片虽然看起来普通，但上面雕刻的图案纹样倒是让我有一种莫名熟悉的感觉，可能真有什么玄机也未可知。¤Wait... Although this fragment looks ordinary, the patterns carved on it make me feel inexplicably familiar. Maybe there is really no secret.
我看道友这一身修为，应是拜入了星河剑派的师门，老夫说的可对？¤I think Fellow Daoist's cultivation base should be worshipped by the master of the Galaxy Sword Sect. Is that what the old man said right?
你不会是想说，这破碎片就是那元婴大能洞府的钥匙吧？¤You don't mean to say that this broken piece is the key to the Nascent Soul Da Neng Dongfu, right?
我看道友这一身修为，应是拜入了金虹剑派的师门，老夫说的可对？¤I think Fellow Daoist's cultivation base should be worshipped by the master of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect. Is what the old man said right?
（不会吧，难道这碎片还真是那什么涵虚仙人洞府的钥匙？）¤(No way, is this fragment really the key to that Hanxu Immortal Dongfu?)
谁知道这是不是你哪里捡来的垃圾，我有那么好骗么？¤Who knows if this is the rubbish you picked up, am I that good to cheat?
他在渡劫前曾放出消息，将他洞府的“钥匙”分成数份，分散到了各处。凡是能将这些钥匙的碎片拼凑完整者，就能打开他的洞府，得到他的传承。¤Before he crossed the Tribulation, he had released the news and divided his Dongfu's keys into several parts and scattered them everywhere. Anyone who can piece these key fragments together can open his Dongfu and get his inheritance.
哈哈哈，道友猜得不错！这便是那把钥匙的碎片之一，老夫我也是在一次机缘巧合之下偶然所得啊。可惜这么多年过去了，也没有得到有关其他碎片的消息，索性今日就当赐你一份机缘，2000灵石卖给你了。¤Hahaha, fellow daoist guessed right! This is one of the fragments of that key. Old man, I also got it by chance by chance. It's a pity that after so many years, I haven't received any news about other fragments. Today, I should give you a chance to sell you 2000 spirit stones.
不如这样，道友只需出上500灵石，这次我便帮道友好好算上一卦，保管灵验，如何？¤Why don't it be like this. Dao friends only need to pay 500 spiritual stones. This time I will help Dao to be friendly and count as a trigram, and keep the efficacious.
你若有所思的念叨了几句，再抬起头的时候，发现那名老道不知何时已经走远了...¤You muttered a few thoughtfully, and when you raised your head, you found that the old Taoist did not know when he had gone far...
额...就这点儿？¤Uh... just that?
道友，你这命理倒是十分诡异，难以测算。不过依老夫看，你虽命中多劫难，但只需始终坚守着自己的一份道心，最终便能逢凶化吉啊。¤Friends of Daoist, your numerology is very weird and difficult to calculate. However, according to the old man, although you have suffered many catastrophes, you only need to stick to your own Dao heart, and eventually you will be able to turn good luck.
站住！¤stop!
我看道友还未曾拜入宁州大派，至今还是一介散修，老夫说的可对？¤I think fellow Daoists have not yet joined the Ning Province School. They are still a independent cultivator. Is that correct?
咳咳，道友莫急，老夫这门祖传的相术，上可看往生，下可算后世。这往生皆已是定数，自然好看，但后世乃未定之数，可没有那么容易。¤Ahem, fellow daoist, don't worry, the old man, this ancestral physiognomy, can be seen in the past life, and the next life can be regarded as the next life. This life is a fixed number, and it is naturally beautiful, but the future generations are indefinite.
怎么样，老夫所言非虚吧。¤Well, what the old man said is true.
据老夫猜测，一旦将玉佩拼凑完整，就能够通过玉佩感知到洞府的大概位置了。¤According to the old man's guess, once the jade pendant is pieced together, the approximate location of the cave can be perceived through the jade pendant.
咳咳...这样吧，你我二人也算有缘，今日竟然又遇见了，老夫便赐你一个机缘，过去的事情就莫要再提了。¤Ahem...Let's do it, you and I are also considered to be predestined, but we met again today, and the old man gave you a chance. Don’t mention the past.
道友的命理粗看杂乱无章，多有险阻。但所谓顺为凡，逆为仙，修真本就是逆天而为，命数不由天定。道友的曙光或许就在历经磨难，破棘而出的那一刻。¤The numerology of a Daoist is disorganized at first glance, and there are many dangers. But the so-called obedience to the ordinary, the reverse is the immortal, the cultivation of the true is to go against the sky, the number of fate is not determined by the sky. The dawn of the Daoist may be through the hardships, breaking the thorn Moment.
罢了罢了，你有多少灵石就出多少灵石吧。¤It's fine, you can produce as many spirit stones as you have.
若非老夫年事已高，恐怕时日无多，也不会甘心把这份机缘让给他人...哎...你拿去吧。¤If the old man is not old, I am afraid that time is running out, and he will not be willing to give this opportunity to others... hey... take it.
你看，这是什么？¤Look, what is this?
你这所谓的算卦之术，最多不过是一些能辨人年龄修为的小法门。至于算往生，定来世，就完全只是说一些套话来糊弄人罢了。¤Your so-called fortune-telling technique is at best a small technique that can distinguish people's age and cultivation base. As for the calculation of the death and the afterlife, it is just to fool people by saying some clichés.
他一边说着，又要往客栈外走去...¤While he was talking, he was going to go outside the inn again...
法宝有灵，这玉佩既然是洞府开关的钥匙，想必和洞府间必然有着深刻的联系。否则当年涵虚仙人也不会放出消息，让大家收集玉佩残片。¤The magic weapon is alive. Since this jade pendant is the key to the cave mansion switch, it must have a deep connection with the cave mansion. Otherwise, the Hanxu immortal would not release news back then and let everyone collect jade pendant fragments.
道友命理诡异，却又能频频逢凶化吉，实乃老夫生平罕见。¤The Daoist numerology is weird, but he can frequently turn the bad into the auspicious. It is really rare in the life of an old man.
倒有几分眼力，不过你能不能说些有意义的？¤I have some insight, but can you say something meaningful?
我看道友这一身修为，应是拜入了化尘教的师门，老夫说的可对？¤I think that the Taoist fellow's cultivation base should be worshipped by the teacher of the Aeonic Sands Temple. Is what the old man said right?
怎么又是你这个骗子，你是不是对每个人都说一样的话？¤Why are you a liar again, do you say the same thing to everyone?
啧啧啧，道友面露煞气，想必也是个杀伐果决之人呐。只是这修仙一途，虽是逆天改命，但这逆天之事行的越多，日后受天道考验之时也越是凶险，道友当慎重而为啊。¤Tsk tusk tusk, fellow Daoist cheeks sullen, presumably he is also a person who kills the fruit. It's just that this path of cultivation is against the heavens and changes your fate, but the more things you do against the heavens, the more you will be tested by the way of heaven in the future. The more dangerous it is, fellow daoists should act cautiously.
要不就把你之前骗我的灵石还给我，不然我就在这里当众揭穿你的骗术。¤Or give me back the spirit stone you deceived me before, or I will expose your deception in public here.
你聚集灵气，朝那枚碎片狠狠刺去，只见一道蓝光一闪，刚刚的攻击竟消失的无影无踪，碎片果然完好无损。¤You gathered your spiritual energy and pierced fiercely at the fragment, only to see a blue light flashing, the attack just disappeared without a trace, and the fragments were intact as expected.
见过掌门。¤Meet the Master.
{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}，这次我派能够复原失传多年的《真元玄典》，并收入秘阁，多亏了你在宁州古迹中找到的残本。¤{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}, This time our faction was able to recover the long lost True Origin Xuan Dian and include it in the secret pavilion, thanks to the remnants you found in the Ning Province monuments.
这次请师祖回来，正是为了亲手把这复原的《真元玄典》交予您手中。¤This time, I have asked the Master to return precisely to personally hand over this restored copy of the True Elemental Canon to you.
我竹山宗于数万年前创立时，能够在宁州扎稳脚根，靠的便是这《真元玄典》。我派后续的诸多功法，法门，也皆以此心法为基础所创。¤When the Bamboo Mountain Sect was founded tens of thousands of years ago, it relied on the ''True Element Mystic Canon'' to establish a firm foothold in Ning Province. Many of the subsequent techniques and teachings of our sect were also created on the basis of this Heart Method.
多谢掌门。¤Thanks a lot, Master.
好，你们辛苦了。¤Well, you have worked hard.
这次让{$TmpTalkString}回来，正是为了亲手把这复原的《真元玄典》交予你手中。希望你能好生研习，将此功法传承下去。¤I have asked {$TmpTalkString} to return this time precisely to personally hand over this restored True Origin Xuan Dian to you. I hope that you will study it well and pass on this technique.
师弟，据说你和诸位长老已将《真元玄典》复原完毕？¤Senior brother, it is said that you and the elders have finished restoring the True Genesis Xuan Dian?
正是。这次我派能够复原失传多年的《真元玄典》，并收入秘阁，多亏了师祖当年在宁州古迹中找到的残本。¤Exactly. This time, our school was able to recover the long-lost True Genesis and include it in the secret pavilion thanks to the remnants of the book that our master ancestor found in the monuments of Ning Province back then.
身后的铁剑应声安定下来，眼前的景色变换，你从血色的幻象之中脱离出来，惊魂未定地喘着粗气...¤The iron sword behind you settled down, the scenery in front of you changed, and you escaped from the bloody illusion, panting in shock...
玄骨老祖阴鸷的双眸冷冷地扫过人群，最终紧紧黏着在你的身上，你与他的目光稍一接触，身后的铁剑便无可抑制地抖动起来。¤The eagle eyes of Patriarch Dark Bones swept across the crowd coldly, and finally clung to you. The moment you make contact with his gaze, the iron sword behind you trembles irresistibly.
{color=#d0380a}诛仙剑{/color}...你是说？¤{color=#d0380a}Zhu Xianjian{/color}...you mean?
伴随戮仙剑的消失，大殿中的煞气也逐渐变得稀薄起来。但宁州古迹本就处于不稳定的位面中，古神教护法的一剑更是令此地雪上加霜，巨大的引力似乎要将所有人抽入虚空之中。¤With the disappearance of the Immortal Executing Sword, the evil spirit in the hall has gradually become thinner. But the ancient monuments of Ning Province are already in an unstable plane, and the sword of the ancient gods’ guardian makes this place even worse. The huge Gravity seems to have to Dump everyone into the void.
双目变得通红，你仿佛突然置身于一片血海之中，无数的尸骨从你身边飘过。尽管你道心坚定，也不由的感到惊骇，下意识地向后退了一步。¤Both eyes turned red, as if you were suddenly in a sea of ​​blood, and countless bones drifted past you. Although your Dao heart was firm, you couldn't help but feel horrified and took a step back subconsciously.
诛仙剑与戮仙剑之间互有感应，那玄骨恐怕已经顺着这股气息发现了你。¤There is resonance between the Zhuxian Sword and the Immortal Executing Sword. I am afraid that Profound Ancient has found you following this breath.
不好，这片位面快要崩塌了，快走！¤No, this plane is about to collapse, go!
大家先离开这座地宫，到空间相对平稳的地方去！¤Everyone first leave this underground palace and go to a place where the space is relatively stable!
想来那幽绿的火芒定是某种能够让人在空间裂隙中穿梭的神通，你们虽想追击却也无可奈何。¤If you want to come, the green flames must be some kind of magical power that can let people shuttle through the spatial rift. Although you want to pursue them, you have no alternative.
戮仙剑剑刃所过之处，一道宽阔的空间裂隙如放大的眼眸般睥睨着你们，其中传来的强大吸力甚至令弥漫的煞气也减淡了几分。¤Where the blade of the Immortal Executing Sword passes, a wide spatial rift stares at you like enlarged eyes, and the powerful suction that comes from it even diminishes the suffocation a little bit.
魏无极目光严肃地盯着玄骨老人，你竟少有地从他的眼神中看到一丝担忧。¤Wei Wuji stared at the old man Profound Ancient seriously, you rarely see a trace of worry in his eyes.
具体的情况等离开这里以后再说，这玄骨老祖凭戮仙剑之威劈开了空间，这片小位面很快就要崩塌了，必须尽快离开这里！¤The specific situation will be discussed after I leave here. Patriarch Dark Bones split the space with the power of the Immortal Executing Sword. This small plane is about to collapse soon, and I must leave here as soon as possible!
魏老...这，这是怎么回事？¤Old Wei...what, what's going on?
那玄骨道人瞥了你一眼，咧嘴一笑。幽绿的光芒突然自戮仙剑燃起，迅速地烧至古神教护法全身，他头也不回地大步跨进那道庞巨的空间裂隙中。¤The Profound Ancient Taoist glanced at you and grinned. The faint green light suddenly ignited from the Immortal Executing Sword and quickly burned to the body of the ancient gods’ guardian. He strode into the huge spatial rift without looking back. In the rift.
定！¤set!
不过除了这些人，你还见到了两个熟悉的面孔，他们匆匆赶来，在离你稍近的地方观礼。¤But in addition to these people, you see two familiar faces who have hurried over to watch the ceremony from a little closer to you.
你腾空而起，四下观瞧，在附近的岛屿上找了一处开阔的空地准备迎接天劫。¤You rise into the air and look around, finding an open space on a nearby island to prepare for the apocalypse.
不过除了这些人，你还见到了一个熟悉的面孔，他匆匆赶来，在离你稍近的地方观礼。¤But in addition to these people, you see a familiar face who has hurried over to watch the ceremony from a little closer to you.
在这片海域上，也有不少的修士被这天地异象所吸引，但他们不敢靠近，只能远远的围观。¤On this sea, there were also many cultivators who were attracted by this heaven and earth vision, but they did not dare to approach and could only watch from afar.
不过除了这些人，你还见到了几个熟悉的面孔，他们匆匆赶来，在离你稍近的地方观礼。¤But in addition to these people, you see a few familiar faces who have hurried over to watch the ceremony from a little closer to you.
何况，就算长老能赶到，二叔怕是已经......对了！那颗丹药！¤What's more, even if the elders can arrive, the second uncle is probably already... by the way! That pill!
那金丹修士似光电般急速退远，召出法宝再度上前。两人战到一起，兵戈之声铮铮不绝，你与倪旭欣站在一旁焦急地等待着。¤The Golden Core cultivator retreated quickly like a lightning, and summoned a magic weapon to step forward again. The two fought together, and the sound of soldiers was endless. You and Ni XuXin stood aside anxiously and waited.
竟是倪家之人...这倒是有些难办。¤It's actually from the Ni family... This is a bit difficult to handle.
这点小事你不必放在心上，今日还是多亏你二叔救了咱们，只凭我可拦不住那人。¤You don't have to worry about this little thing. Today, thanks to your second uncle who saved us, I can't stop that person.
这位道友看来是想插手此事？¤This fellow Taoist seems to want to intervene in this matter?
倪家二叔本就强打精神与他对峙，见此情景心下一松，昏死过去。¤The second uncle of the Ni family had already confronted him with strong fighting spirit. Seeing this scene, he felt relieved and passed out.
倪兄可知你们家族的其他长老赶过来还需多久？¤Brother Ni, know how long it will take for the other elders of your family to come over?
可惜，你们今天遇到的是老夫。¤Unfortunately, it was an old man you met today.
那人声色俱厉地呵责着倪旭欣，但你仍能看出其中浓厚的关切之意。¤The man scolded Ni XuXin violently, but you can still see the deep concern in it.
二叔！你来啦！¤Second Uncle! You are here!
哎呀错了错了，不是这个。¤Oh, wrong, wrong, not this.
但见到服下丹药的倪叔几息之间便充盈生气，身上的伤口迅速地恢复起来，你顿感或许是自己多心了。¤But seeing Uncle Ni who took the pill, he was full of anger within a few breaths, and the wound on his body quickly healed. You suddenly feel that you may be worried.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}快帮我找找！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} help me find it!
二叔！二叔你没事吧！¤Second Uncle! Second Uncle, are you okay!
对对对！上次在龙隐洞拿到的那个丹药！就是它！¤Yes, yes! The pill that I got in Longyin Cave last time! That's it!
咳...咳咳......¤Cough...cough cough...
他一边说着，一边祭出一柄银色的短剑，一看便不是凡品。你和倪旭欣面面相觑，都感到事情有些棘手...¤While he was talking, he sacrificed a silver dagger. It was not a common product. You and Ni XuXin looked at each other, and both felt that things were a little tricky...
你上前同倪旭欣一起查探他的伤势，发现他的状况并不乐观。¤You went forward to investigate his injuries with Ni XuXin and found that his condition is not optimistic.
莫非你是说......？¤Do you mean...?
说时迟那时快，只见那人右手一挥，金色长剑骤然出现，以雷霆万钧之势向前劈去。¤It's too late to say that it's fast, I saw the man waved his right hand, and the golden long sword suddenly appeared, slashing forward with the force of thunder.
（摇头）二叔刚才应该是诓他，我可没有听说过什么命符还可以用来通知家族长老支援的。¤(Shaking his head) The second uncle should have blamed him just now. I haven't heard of any life talisman that can be used to notify family elders to support.
二人修为将近，僵持良久也未能分出胜负。金丹修士见状一时恶向胆边生，运了十足的力气直向倪旭欣冲来。¤The two are similar in their level of cultivation, and the fight has been in a stalemate for a while. Seeing this, the Golden Core cultivator suddenly turned to and rushed towards Ni XuXin with full strength.
有几分本事，若是寻常的金丹修士也许还真拿不住你们两个。¤Quite skillful. It's possible that an ordinary Golden Core cultivator wouldn't be able to deal with you two.
这下暂时应该没问题了......不过还是得赶紧送二叔回武陵城才是。¤It should be okay for now...but you still have to send your second uncle back to Wuling City quickly.
倪旭欣慌忙地从储物袋里倒出一堆丹药瓶子，五花八门的标签让你眼花缭乱。¤Ni XuXin hurriedly poured out a bunch of pills of medicine bottles from the storage bag. The various labels dazzled you.
不知道友受何人所雇取我侄儿性命？那人所出报酬我倪家愿双倍奉上。¤I don't know who your friend hired to take my nephew's life? The Ni family would like to double the reward for that person.
咳咳......你虽伤了我，但刚刚也中了我的剑气。要是再强行运气施展法术，导致经脉受损，自己也讨不得好。¤Cough cough...Although you hurt me, you just caught my sword aura. If you use your luck to cast spells and cause damage to the meridians, you won't be pleased.
道友手下留情！¤Friends of Taoism are merciful!
那{xiaozi}和你可以走，但你侄子必须留下好让我交差。¤Then {xiaozi} and you can go, but your nephew must stay so that I can cross.
道友言下之意是？¤What does the Taoist fellow mean?
你小子可叫我好找！每次出门都闯祸，最后叫家里人给你善后。¤You kid can make me easy to find! Every time I go out, I get into trouble, and finally I ask my family to help you deal with the aftermath.
不过受人钱财，替人办事。报酬我已收下，事情必须得有个结果。¤But I accept money and do things for others. I have accepted the reward, and things must have a result.
紧要关头，那人舍身护住倪旭欣，替他挡下了致命的一击。金丹修士眼见计谋落败，祭起法宝又想再攻。¤At a critical moment, the man sacrificed himself to protect Ni XuXin and blocked a fatal blow for him. The Golden Core cultivator saw that his plan was about to fail, he grab on to his magic weapon and wanted to attack again.
黑色瓷瓶里倒出的丹药上流动着暗金光芒，不知为何你隐约感觉这颗来历不明的丹药存在着某些问题。¤The pill poured out of the black porcelain bottle is filled with dark golden light. For some reason, you vaguely feel that this pill of unknown origin has some problems.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，今日我又欠了你一个人情，我...¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, today I owe you another favor, I...
你还是赶紧送你二叔回武陵城疗伤去吧！¤You should send your second uncle back to Wuling City for healing!
既然如此，那便手下见真章！¤If this is the case, then see the real chapter!
那金丹修士面色阴晴不定，左思右想下大抵还是觉得性命更重，踩着剑便逃遁而去。¤The Golden Core cultivator's complexion was uncertain, but after thinking about it, he still felt that his life was more important, so he stepped on the sword and fled.
刚刚我已通过命符通知家族的其它长老，奉劝你还是走为上策。伤了我又想害旭欣，倪家定叫你偿命。¤I have just notified the other elders of the family through the destiny, and I advise you to take the best policy. I hurt Xuxin and want to harm Xuxin, Ni Jiading asks you to pay for my life.
看来此地至少有元婴期龙族战死，这冲天战意混着这死气，早已把这此地变成大凶之地了，这种地方最有可能产生渊血冥花、厉魂血珀之类的宝物。¤It seems that this place at least the YuanYing stage dragon war dead, this sky war intention mixed with this dead air, has long turned this place into a place of great evil, this kind of place is most likely to produce the abyssal blood meditation flower, LiShenBloodPer and other treasures.
你神识扫过。¤You soul sense swept.
此地似乎并没有什么。¤This place does not seem to have anything.
你眼前是一片废墟，其中死气弥漫。¤In front of you is a rubble filled with death.
嗯，我会自己小心的。¤Well, I will take care of myself.
9011，岛屿修士争斗（普通）¤9011, Battle of the Island cultivators (Normal)
要去哪里采集呢？{w}{w=0.5}¤Where are we going to collect?{w}{w=0.5}
方才听见外面的打斗声我斗胆一试，拼尽全力将元神波动送出阵法外，幸而你发现了。¤I just heard the sound of fighting outside. I tried my best and tried my best to send the soul fluctuation out of the formation. Fortunately, you found out.
这些修士被你打得七零八落，栽栽歪歪地靠在墙上，你看到他们狼狈的样子摇了摇头，飞快地沿着台阶向上跑去。¤These cultivators were beaten up by you, leaning on the wall crookedly, you shook your head when you saw them embarrassed, and ran up the steps quickly.
抱歉，我{SayStcVal=917}二层，只接纳金丹期及以上前辈，或是财资雄厚的道友。¤Sorry, I’m on the second floor of {SayStcVal=917}, and only accept seniors of Jindanqi and above, or those with strong financial resources.
前辈请~¤Senior please~
城外村落星罗棋布，城内仙府鳞次栉比，各安天命，一派安详。¤The villages outside the city are dotted with villages and the immortal houses inside are lined up, each in peace and tranquillity.
沿着山路奔波数日，终于来到了武陵城下。¤After traveling along the mountain road for several days, We finally arrived at the foot of Wuling City.
不错，不错...¤Not bad...
算了算了，老夫再找找别人吧...¤Forget it, I can find someone else...
嗯...看来这味“龙须根”还是有些问题...¤Hmm...it seems that there are still some problems with this dragon root...
你来的正好，老夫这炉丹药正炼到关键时候，脱不开身。现在还缺了一味”百草露“，你身上可有备着？¤Ah you are here just at the right time. This old man can't leave the Pill furnance right now, but I still require a Panacea Dew, do you happen to have one?
你来的正好，老夫这炉丹药正炼到关键时候，脱不开身。现在还缺了一味”火精枣“，你身上可有备着？¤Ah you are here just at the right time. This old man can't leave the Pill furnance right now, but I still require a Firelight Jujube, do you happen to have one?
你来的正好，老夫正要开炉炼丹，你再来给老夫打个下手。¤You are here just right, the old man is about to open the furnace to make alchemy, you come to give the old man a start.
生命值上限-1¤Max HP-1
没想到这“龙纹草”作为药引还有如此功效，不错，不错...¤I didn't expect that using Dragonvein Leaf as temperature control can have such an effect, not bad, not bad...
看来这里使用“五柳根”还是有些问题，不能直接用来代替古方中的材料...¤It seems that there are still some problems with the use of the Petrificious Root. It cannot be used directly to replace the ingrediants in the ancient recipe...
生命值上限+3¤Max HP +3
嗯...看来是“黄枫草”中和了\"龙须根”的毒性...¤Hmm... It seems that the yellow maple herb has neutralized the toxicity of the dragon's beard root...
这个...晚辈正好肚子不舒服，前辈还是找别人帮忙吧！¤This...junior just happens to have an uncomfortable stomach, seniors should ask someone for help!
晚辈这会儿正有些急事要办，前辈您看....¤Junior is having something urgent to do right now, senior, look at it...
臭{xiaozi}，没有你说有，你莫不是在拿老夫寻开心？¤Smelly {xiaozi}, without you saying yes, are you making fun of the old man?
你来的正好，老夫这炉丹药正炼到关键时候，脱不开身。现在还缺了一味”天元果“，你身上可有备着？¤Ah you are here just at the right time. This old man can't leave the Pill furnance right now, but I still require a Skyborne fruit, do you happen to have one?
（长老好像正在研究丹方...我还是不要打扰他了）¤(The elder seems to be studying the pill...I still don't bother him)
加了一味“龙须根”，居然还能有这等妙用，有趣，有趣...¤Adding a taste of Dragon Root, it can still have such magical effects, interesting and interesting...
哈哈哈哈，你来的正好，老夫这批新药刚刚出炉，正想找人来试一试呢。¤Hahahaha, you just came here, the old man has just released this batch of new medicines, and I'm looking for someone to try it out.
你接过丹药长老手中的扇子，替他慢慢扇起火来...¤You take the fan in Elder Pill Medicine and slowly fan the fire for him...
嗯，不错，你的修为相比上次倒是又有了些长进。老夫也不会白让你辛苦这一个多月，这枚洗髓丹就当你帮我看护丹炉的报酬了。¤Well, good, your cultivation has improved compared to last time. This old man will not let you work for more than a month in vain. This Minor Qi Pill will be your reward for helping me take care of the alchemy furnace.
算了算了，老夫还是自己想想办法吧。¤Forget it, the old man should think of a solution by himself.
你服下药丸，味道不错，但好像什么效果也没有...¤You take the pill, it tastes good, but it seems to have no effect...
药丸入口即化，你只觉得一股暖流直通你的丹田，你连忙盘腿打坐，将药力完全炼化开，只觉得浑身精力充沛，说不出来的舒坦。¤The pill melts in the mouth. You just feel that a warm current flows through your dantian. You quickly meditate cross-legged to fully refine the power of the medicine. You only feel energetic and uncomfortable.
嗯...这“雪玉骨参”不亏是天下奇药，连炼制起来的方法都和一般的草药不一样。¤Um...this Snow Jade Bone Ginseng is a wonder medicine in the world, and even the method of refining it is different from ordinary herbs.
你服下药丸，没过多久，就觉得头晕眼花，浑身乏力了起来...¤You took the pill and it didn't take long for you to feel dizzy and weak...
哈哈哈哈，老夫这龙虎丹终于练成了，这古方中的材料果然是可以用药性相似的草药去替换的。¤Hahahaha, this old man has finally synthesized the Wild Beast Pill, I was right that the materials listed in this ancient recipe can be replaced with herbs with similar medicinal properties.
阁下这可不是问问题的态度。¤This is not the attitude of your Excellency to ask questions.
离火门{FirstName}{LastName}，运送火麟玉而来。¤The Heavenly Fire Gate {FirstName}{LastName}, carrying the Fire Lin Jade.
咱有些问题想要问问道友，不知可否移步？¤We have some questions for you, may I move?
一不留神，你陷入了一座困阵之中。¤Inadvertently, you are caught in a trapped formation.
恒如道友客气了，留步。¤You are welcome, Daoist Heng Ru, stay for a while.
阁下跟了我一路了，也不知有何贵干啊。¤Your Excellency has followed me all the way, and I don't know what you're up to.
走好，不送。希望还有再见之日。¤Goodbye, no farewell. I hope to see you again.
你察觉到一缕气息自你出了化尘教，就一直尾随在你身后。¤You perceive a wisp of breath that has been trailing you since you left the Cult of the Transfiguration.
恒如长老早就吩咐下来了，我这就传信通知他。¤Elder Heng Ru ordered it down a long time ago, so I'll send a message to inform him.
何苦呢？困兽之斗，不过是多吃点苦头罢了。¤Why suffer? A trapped beast is just a little more suffering.
此次火麟玉品质上乘，多谢道友及时送达了。¤This time, the Fire Forest Jade is of the highest quality, so thank you for delivering it in time.
虽是许久无人维护，但眼前的药田到没有完全荒废。¤Although it has been unmaintained for a long time, the medicine field in front of me has not been completely deserted.
一番查探你发现此地的尚有一座阵法在运转，其中长有几株草药。¤After some investigation, you find that there is still a formation in operation here, and there are several herbs growing in it.
道友出海时若是遇上乱流也无需太过惊慌，可以看看附近是否有修士聚集的避难岛屿。某些修士会在乱流到来时就近选择岛屿开辟洞府，求得一线生机。¤If you encounter turbulence when you go out to sea, you don’t need to be too alarmed. You can see if there are nearby refuge islands where cultivators gather. When the turbulence comes, some cultivators will choose the nearby islands to open up caves to get a glimmer of life.
好险...禾山道和沂山派打架，我凑啥热闹，唉...¤Good risk... Heshan Dao and Yishan faction are fighting, why should I join in the fun, alas...
哪里多出来的{xiaozi}，坏我们好事。¤Where is the extra {xiaozi}, it's a good thing for us.
哼今天先放过你们，我们走！¤Huh, let you go today, let's go!
他奶奶的，要不是大哥不在，轮得到你们嚣张？¤His grandma, if it wasn't for the eldest brother's absence, it would be your turn to be arrogant?
哈哈哈哈，你们刚刚不是很能么？¤Hahahaha, weren't you very good just now?
这玉简当真能跑……好在追它的时候，倒也习得了一丝遁术的门道。¤This jade jane when really can run ...... well when chasing it, but also learned a trace of the doorway of the art of evasion.
说是静室，但这里大得出奇，又异常空旷，倒是个施展拳脚的好地方。¤It is said to be a quiet room, but it is surprisingly large and unusually empty, so it is a good place to practice your fists and feet.
你运起遁术，将速度提升到极致，但以你的速度却根本无法追上它。¤You used your transport technique to increase your speed to the extreme, but with your speed you can't catch up with it at all.
领悟遁术《{color=#d0380a}鹤点足{/color}》¤The newest and most popular of these is the '{color=#d0380a}Crane Pointing Foot{/color}'.
你追上去又试着触碰了它几次，并仔细观察它逃走的原理。如此反复了数个时辰。¤You went after it and tried to touch it a few more times, and carefully observed the principle of its escape. This was repeated for several hours.
你试图动用灵力将它吸入手中，但它却不受此影响，纹丝不动。¤You tried to draw it into your hand with your spiritual power, but it was unaffected by this and did not move.
原来如此，这空间波动的原理，我若能运用在遁术上，必然大有突破。¤I see, this principle of spatial fluctuations, if I can apply it to the art of evasion, there will be a great breakthrough.
“飘在空中的玉简？倒是闻所未闻，不知其中究极有何玄机。”¤A jade slip floating in the air? It is unheard of, I wonder what the mystery is.
你运起遁术，将速度提升到极致，但是随着你的速度越快，它消失的速度便也越快。¤The more you transport the art of evasion, the more speed you can increase to the extreme, but the faster you go, the faster it disappears.
但以你的悟性，根本看不出什么门道。¤But with your enlightenment, you can't see any doorway at all.
你索性盘腿坐下，潜心感悟这玉简的运行原理……¤You simply sit down cross-legged, dive into the operation principle of this jade brief ......
你似乎发现了它在逃走的那一瞬间所隐含的空间波动。¤You seem to have discovered the spatial fluctuations implied by the moment it fled.
这玉简怎如此诡异？究竟是有何蹊跷？¤How can this jade slip be so weird? What is so strange about it?
整个静室内，只有一枚泛着红光的玉简飘在空中，显得甚是诡异。¤The entire quiet room, only a red glowing jade brief floating in the air, looks very strange.
你来到一处怪异的静室。¤You came to a strange quiet room.
玉简在被碰到的前一瞬，竟诡异的消失了，下一瞬便出现在静室的另一处，依旧是一动不动。¤The jade brief was touched a moment before, but bizarrely disappeared, the next instant it appeared in another part of the quiet room, still motionless.
如此反复了数个时辰，你的对遁术的运用愈加熟练，竟多出了一分踏破空间的意思。¤After repeating this for several hours, your use of the evasion technique became more and more proficient, and you actually had a point of stepping through space.
“难道说？”¤Does it mean?
只见玉简上写着《鹤点足》三个字，再往内便隔绝神识，无法探查了。¤Just see the jade slip with the three words 'crane point foot' written on it, and further inside it will isolate the soul sense and cannot be probed.
{FirstName}道友，这是...？¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, is this...?
魔修竟会混入化尘教内部，不知其余各派是否安好...¤The evil cultivator will be mixed into the dust sect, I don't know if the other factions are well...
赤火元铜精...！没想到宁州古迹中竟真有此物的存在，如此看来当真是那位的天命...！¤Crimson Fire Yuan Bronze Essence...! I didn't expect this thing to exist in the ancient ruins in Ning Province, so it seems that it is really that person's destiny...!
{FirstName}长老，这是...？¤Elder {FirstName}, is this...?
多谢道友找回我宗门传承，这是你应得的报酬！¤Thank you fellow daoists for retrieving our Sect inheritance, this is the reward you deserve!
哈哈哈哈，门派定不会亏待{FirstName}长老，这是你应得的报酬！¤Hahahaha, the school will not treat elder {FirstName} badly, this is the reward you deserve!
小心，不要轻易刺激到这里的胃壁，那样会加快这些酸液的腐蚀性。¤Be careful not to easily irritate the stomach lining here, as this will speed up the corrosion of these acids.
你四处搜索了一番，果然找到了不少未被腐蚀高阶材料，和几颗不知来路的红色晶石。¤You searched around, and sure enough, you found a lot of uncorroded high-level materials, and a few red spar that didn't know where they came from.
哈哈哈，这里确实是个不错的修行之处。鲲族直接施展神通吞噬天地灵气，效果可比一般的聚灵阵法好太多了。¤Hahaha, this is indeed a good place to practice. The Kun people directly use their magical powers to devour the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and the effect is much better than the general spirit gathering formation.
能抵挡住浪方大圣腐蚀的肯定都不是凡物，这些红色晶石说不定也大有名堂...先一并收下再说。¤Those who can resist the corrosion of the Great Sage Langfang are definitely not ordinary things. These red spar may also be famous... Let's accept them together first.
仔细看看，这里还有不少没有被消化干净的妖兽残骸，仔细搜索一番应该会有所收获。¤Take a closer look, there are still a lot of undigested remains of monsters, and a careful search should yield something.
短时间内应该没什么危险了，这浪方体内的灵气极其充裕，只要能把带有腐蚀性的部分净化掉，我甚至能在这里闭关修炼。¤There should be no danger in a short period of time. The spiritual energy in this Langfang is extremely abundant. As long as the corrosive part can be purified, I can even practice retreat here.
看来浪方大圣果然不在全盛状态，连这吞噬神通的威能也下降了不少。¤It seems that the Great Sage Langfang is really not in his prime, and even the power of devouring magical powers has dropped a lot.
随着吸力的减弱，你终于从浪方黏糊糊的肉壁上挣脱开，跳到了下方开阔的空地上。¤As the suction weakened, you finally broke free from the sticky walls of the waves and jumped into the open space below.
肉壁被你轰出一个大洞，海水瞬间涌了进来。你抓住机会，从洞口逃了出去...¤You blasted a big hole in the meat wall, and the sea water poured in instantly. You took your chance and escaped through the hole...
或许你师傅便是想让你克服这一点？¤Maybe that's what your master wants you to overcome?
谢谢你。¤Thank you.
可究竟如何才算拼尽全力？倘若事后发觉有更好的解法，可还算是拼尽全力？¤But what is the best effort? If you find out later that there is a better solution, is that still a good effort?
世事无常，每个人都有自己的局限，若拼尽全力仍然无法解决问题，坦然接受便好。¤Everyone has their own limitations. If you can't solve the problem despite all your efforts, just accept it.
其实有关变故的事你早已从师妹口中知晓，只是故作玩笑语气，好让他坦白的没有太大压力。¤In fact, you already knew about the change from your sister's mouth, but you only pretended to have a joking tone so that he could confess without too much pressure.
这种状态…¤This state...
李青麟听罢，若有所思地点了点头。¤Qinglin Li nodded thoughtfully as he listened.
多谢。{FirstName}道友，请！¤Thanks a lot. {FirstName}Daoist, please!
虽说紧急关头随行长老出手，将弟子们尽数救了下来，但我自入门以来，从没感受过这样的无力…与挫败…¤Although the elders who were with me in the emergency saved all the disciples, I have never felt such powerlessness...and frustration since I started...
只是这与心魔究竟有何联系？¤Just how exactly does this relate to the demons of the mind?
塞翁失马焉知非福，就算最初能找到合适的对手切磋论道，后续发展也不一定都能如愿。¤Even if you can find the right opponent initially, the subsequent development may not always be what you want.
亏你能想出缠绕自身这种取巧的方法，不过以你的水平，想赢我还早了一百年呢。¤You're lucky to have come up with such a tricky way of winding yourself up, but at your level, it's still a hundred years too early to beat me.
若我分析的不错，只要青麟多加实战历练，懂得灵活变通，这心魔也就不攻自破了。¤If my analysis is correct, as long as Qinglin has more practical experience and knows how to be flexible, this demon will not be broken.
这心魔究竟对你造成了什么样的影响？¤What kind of effect has this demon had on you?
若没有那些戾气，我又怎会去招惹那妖王？¤If I didn't have all that hostility, why would I have messed with that demon king?
李青麟暗自咬了咬牙。¤Qinglin Li secretly gritted his teeth.
相互道别后，你二人便当即离开了此地。¤After saying goodbye to each other, the two of you left the place at once.
若能帮到青麟兄，这点小忙又算得了什么？¤If I can help Brother Qinglin, what is this small favour?
我传音邀道友切磋，乃是为了除去长久以来的心魔。¤I have sent a message to invite you to a sparring session in order to remove a long-standing demon.
望你早日克服心魔，后会有期！¤I hope you get over your demons soon and I'll see you later!
每次切磋，李青麟都能掌握一丝诀窍。一个月以来，他的实战技巧大有长进。¤Each time he sparred, Li Qinglin was able to grasp a hint of the knack. Over the past month, his practical combat skills have improved greatly.
{FirstName}道友的实力与品性皆为上佳，自然是为首选。¤{FirstName}Daoist friends are naturally preferred because of their superior strength and character.
不过，在与你交手过后，我总算明白了师尊的良苦用心。¤However, after having fought you, I finally understand the good intentions of my master.
经过这一个月的切磋，你二人之间全然没有了刚见面时的那种拘谨。¤After a month of sparring, the two of you have lost all the formalities between you that you had when you first met.
青麟兄？¤Brother Qinglin?
我原本可以帮师妹争取到更多时间，可那只异种魔的反常举动却让我慌了神。¤I could have helped my sister buy more time, but the perverse behaviour of the fae demon made me panic.
随着李青麟的落败，一阵爽朗的笑声传来。¤As Li Qinglin fell, a hearty laugh came from him.
但如果我没有天灵根，入不了内门呢？面对这个问题，我甚至不敢往下思考。¤But what if I didn't have the Heavenly Spiritual Root and couldn't enter the Inner Sect? Faced with this question, I didn't even dare to think down the road.
此番还是多谢道友了。¤Thank you very much for this time.
既然青麟兄有此心魔，此次约在下切磋又是何意？我又如何能帮你消除心魔？¤Since Brother Qinglin has such a demon in his heart, what is the point of asking me to spar with him? How can I help you eliminate your demons?
事后回想之时已然窥见其全貌，自然会有更好的方法，不必为此自责。¤In retrospect, we have seen the whole picture, and there is a better way to do it, so there is no need to blame ourselves.
这又是从何说起？¤Where does this start?
论道持续了约莫一炷香时间…¤The discourse lasted for about an incense stick...
畏惧魔物我尚能理解，不过你我二人只是切磋罢了，何需如此？莫非我比那魔物还要可怕？¤I understand the fear of the demon, but you and I are just sparring, why do we need to do this? Am I more fearful than that demon?
原本我等合力击败一只筑基中期的妖兽即可，但当时我心高气傲，便去了一个筑基巅峰的腾蛇洞穴。¤Originally, it was enough for us to combine our efforts to defeat a middle Foundation Establishment Spirit Beast, but at that time I was so high-minded and arrogant that I went to the cave of a peak Foundation Establishment Teng Snakes.
它让我变得不自信…不，说是怯懦也不为过。¤It made me unsure of myself...no, it's not too much to say cowardly.
师尊指示我，若想在结婴之前克服心魔，需要与同辈中的佼佼者切磋论道一番。¤I was instructed by my master that if I wanted to overcome my demons before I formed a baby, I needed to have some sparring sessions with the best of my peers.
说来也是蹊跷。¤It's strange to say the least.
现在就算不敌你，至少也不会生出心魔。但对上别人又当如何，我暂时还没有把握。¤Even if I can't beat you now, at least I won't have a demon in my heart. But I am not sure what I will do against others yet.
在宗门内，我只是倚仗天灵根与师尊的悉心教导，才在同辈中立于不败之地。¤Within the clan, it was only by relying on my Heavenly Spiritual Root and my master's careful teaching that I was able to stand undefeated among my peers.
嗯，此番恩情在下必然铭记在心，后会有期！¤Well, I'm sure I'll remember this kindness, so I'll see you later!
若不是闭关枯坐太过无聊，我又何至于生出那些戾气？¤If I hadn't been so bored with sitting in seclusion, why would I have developed those hostile vibes?
又辩论一会后，他低头沉思了片刻。¤After debating for a while longer, he looked down and pondered for a moment.
这个问题让你一时语塞。¤This question leaves you speechless for a moment.
虽然只有数息时间，可也放跑了那只异种魔，让师妹陷于危难之中…好在有道友相救，才使我不必那么内疚。¤Although it was only a few breaths of time, I let the fae demon get away and put my sister in danger...fortunately, I was saved by my fellow Daoist so that I didn't have to feel so guilty.
还记得，当时{FirstName}道友连番邀请我杀魔，我却以照顾师妹为由推辞了，其实那更像是一个借口。¤I remember when {FirstName}Daoist friends repeatedly invited me to kill demons, but I excused myself on the grounds that I was looking after my sister, which was actually more of an excuse.
他低头沉思了片刻。¤He looked down for a moment in contemplation.
难道说…你师傅认为正是缺乏实战历练，才导致你滋生心魔？¤Could it be that... your master believes that it is the lack of actual combat experience that has caused you to develop demons?
若早知道切磋论道能学到这般技巧，我当初又何必整天闭关枯坐？¤If I had known that I could learn such skills in the dao, why would I have sat in seclusion all day?
至于为何是切磋？切磋如何能消除心魔？其中真意，我却无从得知…¤As for why a cut? How can a sparring session remove the demons of the heart? I have no way of knowing the true meaning...
{FirstName}道友所言极是，不过以{FirstName}道友之见，此心魔应当如何克服为好？¤{But in {FirstName} your opinion, how should this demon be overcome?
我一直埋头修行，倒是从未想过通过外物的方法克服心魔。¤I have always buried my head in my practice, but I have never thought of overcoming my demons through external means.
此事还要从我筑基初期时的那次历练说起。¤This matter also begins with that adventure when I was in the early stage of my foundation building.
既然{FirstName}道友已经看出了端倪，我若再隐瞒反倒是辜负了一片好意。¤Since {FirstName}DaoYou have already seen the light, I would be disappointing my good intentions if I were to conceal it.
略微寒暄几句后，你二人便相互告别离开了此地。¤After exchanging a few pleasantries, the two of you said goodbye to each other and left the place.
倒也不无可能。我自入门以来，大部分时间都在闭关修炼，与同门的比试也通常缺乏挑战，像今天这样的切磋倒是头一遭。¤It's not impossible. Since I started, I have spent most of my time in seclusion, and competitions with fellow disciples have usually lacked challenges.
诚然，表面上缺乏历练与心魔毫无关联，但他师傅的指示也绝不可能无的放矢，这里面一定有什么更深层次的原因。¤Admittedly, the apparent lack of experience had nothing to do with the demons of the heart, but his master's instructions could never be uninformed either; there must be some deeper reason for this.
你二人星河为友，竹林为伴，日夜切磋论道，沉沦其中。其中逍遥自在，只有你二人知晓。¤You two are friends in the river of stars and the bamboo forest, and you spend your days and nights discussing the dao and sinking into it. You two are the only ones who know the freedom of it.
你察觉到了他的异样，随即停下攻击，走上前去。¤You sense the difference in him and then stop your attack and step forward.
炼气时，师尊看我身具天灵根，便让我成日闭关修炼，无趣的紧。¤When I was refining Qi, my master saw that I had heavenly spiritual roots, so he told me to spend my days in seclusion and cultivation, which was boring.
我也正有此意，请。¤That's exactly what I'd like to do, please.
即便如此，在真正需要我的时候，我却连伸出援手都做不到。¤Even so, I couldn't even lend a hand when I was really needed.
所以，我再也不敢看不起，甚至是有些敬佩我的那些师兄弟们——为什么在如此不利的条件下，竟然还能有这般成就？¤So I no longer dare to look down on, or even somewhat admire, my brothers and teachers - how is it possible to achieve so much under such adverse conditions?
客气，此番能帮到你，便是再好不过了。¤You are most welcome, and it is good to be of help to you this time.
闭关枯坐或许能增长修为，但若要面对日后的种种困境，空有修为自然是远远不够。只用一套功法体系也满足不了实战中的各种需求。¤Sitting in seclusion may increase your cultivation, but if you have to face all kinds of difficulties in the future, empty cultivation is naturally far from enough. A system of gong methods is not enough to meet the various needs in actual combat.
在那以后，每当我遇到类似的情形，我都会想起这段往事…它俨然已经成为了我的心魔。¤After that, whenever I was in a similar situation, I would think about it...it had become a demon in my mind.
那一瞬间，我又回想起了我的心魔。¤In that moment, I had a flashback to my demons.
丹药？¤Pill?
若青麟兄能做到念头通达，或许心魔便能迎刃而解了？¤If Brother Qinglin can achieve a clear mind, perhaps his demons can be resolved?
实战中变数之多，就算打坐一辈子恐怕也无法完全领悟，只有多切磋历练、学习请教方能有备无患。¤There are so many variables in actual combat that even a lifetime of meditation may not lead to full comprehension, so the only way to be prepared is to have more sparring sessions and to seek advice.
的确，青麟兄不如与我论道一番，或许在下愚见能帮助到青麟兄一二。¤Indeed, why don't you discuss with me? Perhaps my humble opinion can help you in some way.
若没去招惹那妖王，我又怎么会生出这心魔？¤If I hadn't provoked that demon king, how would I have developed this demon?
挑战妖王那次，若你经验丰富，知道与筑基巅峰妖王的差距，又或者你非常了解腾蛇，知道缠绕功法很难针对到它，都不至于使同门陷入险境。¤The time you challenged the Demon King, if you were experienced and knew the difference between you and the peak Foundation Establishment Demon King, or if you knew the Teng Serpent well enough to know that it was difficult to target it with your entanglement techniques, you would not have put your fellow disciples in danger.
你隐约观察到，虽然他功法修为极高，所施展的神通亦然强劲，可一招一式皆在你预料之内，并无多少变化。¤You vaguely observe that, although his kung fu training is extremely high and the divine powers he performs are powerful, every move is within your expectation and there is little variation.
所以，说心魔是因为缺乏实战经验而导致的也不为过。¤So it is not too much to say that the demons of the mind are caused by a lack of experience in real combat.
天下没有不散的宴席，既然你已然想明白去路，便后会有期罢。¤There is no such thing as a banquet that doesn't end. Since you've figured out your way out, I'll see you later.
而天魔眼中，若你能提前考虑到分神控制第三只异种魔的后果，也不会因为突如其来的变故而乱了心神。¤And in the eyes of the Heavenly Demon, if you can consider the consequences of distracting yourself from controlling a third Fae demon in advance, you won't be disrupted by a sudden change of heart.
那时我刚将师尊传给我的功法神通修炼至瓶颈，便接到任务带一批练气期弟子去方壶山历练。¤At that time, I had just reached a bottleneck in the cultivation of the divine power passed on to me by my master, and I was given the task of taking a group of Qi training disciples to Fang Hu Mountain for training.
抱歉，让道友见笑了。¤Sorry to make you laugh, my friend.
切磋时，你所使用的功法神通虽然威能不俗，但大都缺乏变通，以至于面对奇招之时疲于应对。¤During the sparring sessions, the techniques you use are not bad, but most of them lack adaptability, so you are tired of dealing with strange moves.
我开始怀疑自己，是否真的如同我想的那么强。¤I began to wonder about myself and whether I was really as strong as I thought I was.
哈哈哈，不知{FirstName}兄以为这招如何？¤Hahahaha, I wonder what {FirstName} brother thinks of this move?
择日不如撞日，道友可愿留下与我操练一番？¤Would you like to stay and train with me?
此番谢过{FirstName}道友了，后会有期。¤Thank you for this {FirstName}, I'll see you later.
不愧是青麟兄，厉害！¤As expected of Brother Qinglin, great!
慌乱的神情只持续了数息时间，便消失不见。¤The panic lasted only a few breaths before it disappeared.
可是…念头通达，谈何容易？¤But...how easy is it to talk about the passage of the mind?
此事，我倒有一丝头绪。¤I do have a clue about this matter.
当真是造化弄人，造化弄人呐…¤It's really a matter of fate...
若我所记不错，你当初面对那三只异种魔时，便是相同的神情吧？¤If I remember correctly, you had the same look when you faced the three Fae demons, didn't you?
李青麟犹豫了一会，最终还是叹了口气。¤Li Qinglin hesitated for a moment, but finally sighed.
而真正的原因是，我受到心魔的影响，内心之中对未知的恐惧占了上风，直到数个时辰之后才缓过神来。¤And the real reason is that I was affected by the demons of my mind and the fear of the unknown prevailed in my heart and I did not get over it until several hours later.
他们纷纷看着我，希望我力挽狂澜，但我却什么都做不到，只是愣在原地……\t¤They all looked at me, hoping I would save the day, but I couldn't do anything but freeze in place ......\t
多谢{FirstName}道友提醒，我这便去拜会本门的炼丹长老，后会有期。¤Thank you {FirstName} for reminding me, I will go and pay my respects to the alchemy elders of our sect, see you later.
随着你奇招频出，他的神情开始慌乱，动作也变得僵硬起来。¤As you make your strange moves, he begins to look flustered and his movements become stiff.
青麟兄不妨尝试一下，通过服用丹药增加心境的方式遏制心魔？¤Brother Qinglin might try to curb his mind demons by taking pills to increase his state of mind?
或许在我能灵活应对各种情形之时，便是我心魔便完全消除之日。¤Perhaps when I am able to respond flexibly to all situations, the day my demons will be completely removed.
{FirstName}道友所说确实不无道理，在下这便回洞府消化一番。¤{FirstName}Daoist friend's words are indeed not without merit, I will go back to my cave to digest some of them.
这一个月来，不知你那心魔可还健在？¤In the past month, I wonder if your demon is still alive?
可谁想，那条腾蛇异常灵活，我的缠绕功法非但没有对它产生效果，其藤曼反倒为它所用，同行的炼气期弟子都被它缠得动弹不得。¤But who would have thought that the teng snake was so flexible that instead of my winding technique having an effect on it, its vine man was instead used by it, and the fellow Qi Refining disciples were unable to move as they were entangled by it.
怎么了，你是不是想起了什么？¤What's wrong, do you think of something?
周天的灵气倏然平静下来，你明白自己已经离开了空间裂隙，进入了一个相对安稳的位面空间之中。¤Zhou Tian's aura suddenly calmed down. You understand that you have left the space rift and entered a relatively stable plane space.
没什么，我可以确定千年前自己来过这里，但当年到底在这里发生了什么...¤Nothing, I can be sure that I came here thousands of years ago, but what happened here that year...
看来这里就是古战场所在的位面，灵气虽然还算充沛，但并不如宁州那样稳定。¤It seems that this is the plane where the ancient battlefield is located. Although the aura is still abundant, it is not as stable as Ning Province.
走吧，这里应该离古战场的核心区域应该还有不少的距离，总之还是先找到那座古城所在的位置吧。¤Let's go, there should be a lot of distance from the core area of ​​the ancient battlefield. In short, let's find the location of the ancient city first.
哼，能接下我几招，倒也有几分本事。¤Hmph, it's a bit of a skill to be able to take on my tricks.
我们龙族一向以强者为尊，我认可你的实力。但百里家所窃龙珠于我族意义重大，又事关我龙族尊严，今日若是无法讨得一个说法，我定不会善罢甘休！¤Our dragon family has always respected the strong, and I recognize your strength. But the Dragon Ball stolen by the Baili family is of great significance to our clan, and it is also related to the dignity of our dragon clan. If I can't get an answer today, I will not give up!
也罢，既然我已取回龙珠，那先前同百里家的恩怨便既往不咎，与蓬莎岛及广陵城的协议也就此作罢。不过若你们百里家再打龙珠的主意，我龙族之威可不是你们承受得起的！¤Anyway, since I have retrieved the Dragon Balls, the previous grievances with the Baili family will be forgotten, and the agreement with Pongsha Island and Guangling City will also be abandoned. However, if your Baili family has the idea of ​​playing Dragon Ball again, the might of my dragon clan is not something you can afford!
等眼下的事情忙完...或许我会重新出海游历，去挑战不同海域的强者，磨练自己的修为。¤When the things at the moment are finished... Maybe I will travel to the sea again to challenge the powerhouses in different sea areas and hone my cultivation.
不过这四大妖圣个个都有{color=#d0380a}化神期{/color}实力，我虽然很想见识一番，但只凭我如今的修为实在是有些不自量力了。¤However, all of these four demon saints have the strength of {color=#d0380a}Deity Transformation stage{/color}. Although I really want to see them, I am really overwhelmed by my current cultivation.
龙湛出手的速度比你快上许多，电光火石间便与百里奇战成一团。¤Long Zhan's shot speed is much faster than you, and the lightning and flint fought with Bailiqi.
哎...没想到你们两个小娃娃能有这般心境，倒是比百里家那些个虚长几辈的长老有出息的多。¤Hey... I didn't expect you two little babies to have such a state of mind, but they are much more promising than the elders of the Baili family.
哈哈哈，那这次就先算我百里奇欠{xiongdi}一个人情，日后若有任何需要我帮忙的地方，我必当尽力而为！¤Hahaha, then this time, I will first consider that Bailiqi owes {xiongdi} a favor. If there is any need for my help in the future, I will do my best!
如今龙族与我们的协议已经作罢，我要先与父亲一起重新规划家族商队的航线。¤Now that the agreement between the dragon clan and us has been terminated, I must first re-plan the route of the family caravan with my father.
不知百里兄之后有什么打算？¤I don't know what is Brother Baili's plan in the future?
龙族长老未曾化为本体，就已经有如此实力，真想见识见识那名列于四大妖圣之位的龙族族长覆海大圣，到底有多强。¤The elders of the dragon clan have such strength before they have been transformed into their own bodies. I really want to see how strong the dragon clan chief Fuhai Great Sage, who is listed in the position of the four demon saints, is really strong.
你在一旁观战，趁两人距离稍远时大喊出声。¤You watched the battle, yelling while the two were a little further apart.
传说无尽之海有四大妖圣，分别是化龙海的{color=#d0380a}覆海大圣{/color}，吞云海的{color=#d0380a}吞云大圣{/color}，无尽海渊的{color=#d0380a}九幽大圣{/color}，以及浪方海域的{color=#d0380a}浪方大圣{/color}。¤Legend has it that there are four great demon saints in the endless sea. They are the {color=#d0380a}sea-covering great sage{/color} from the sea of ​​dragons, the {color=#d0380a}cloud-swallowing great sage{/color} from the sea of ​​​​clouds. {color=#d0380a}The Great Sage of the Nine Nethers{/color} in Haiyuan, and {color=#d0380a}The Great Sage of Langfang{/color} in the Langfang Sea.
更不用说海上还有另外三位与之齐名的妖圣，个个修为通天，若此生没有机会与这样的强者交手，岂不是一大憾事。¤Not to mention that there are three other demon saints with the same name in the sea, all of whom have cultivation bases reaching the sky.
想找到龙宫的话，只有先去化龙海，向{color=#d0380a}附近的修士{/color}打探一番，看能不能得到一些有用的线索了。¤If you want to find the Dragon Palace, you can only go to Hualonghai first, and inquire with the cultivators{/color} near {color=#d0380a} to see if they can get some useful clues.
龙湛前辈，且先听我一言。百里兄并非有意失约，实在是事出有因！¤Senior Long Zhan, please listen to me first. Brother Baili didn't mean to miss the appointment, it really happened for a reason!
我曾听说龙族在化龙海建有一座{color=#d0380a}龙宫{/color}，不过却并不知道龙宫的确切位置。¤I once heard that the Dragon Clan built a {color=#d0380a}Dragon Palace{/color} in the Dragon Sea, but I didn't know the exact location of the Dragon Palace.
不臾多时，得了龙珠的龙族果然信守承诺，没有过多计较便返回了无尽之海。你与百里奇回到码头，跳下飞剑落在地面上。¤After a short while, the Dragon Clan who got the Dragon Ball really kept their promise and returned to the Endless Sea without too much care. You and Bai Liqi return to the dock, jump off the flying sword and land on the ground.
百里兄言重了，这次与你一同出海，我也长了不少见识，收获颇丰。何况以我们之间的交情，谈谢不谢的未免有些见外。¤Brother Baili is serious. I have gained a lot of knowledge and gained a lot from going to sea with you this time. What's more, with the friendship between us, it's a bit outlandish to talk about thank you.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，这次多亏你出手相助，才能化解我们百里家与龙族的恩怨，真不知该如何答谢你。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, thanks to your help this time, we can resolve the grievances between our Baili family and the dragon clan. I really don't know how to thank you.
好，那我便先回府处理家族事宜了。日后有事，{xiongdi}便用传音符与我联系吧。¤Well, then I'll go back to the house to deal with family matters. If something happens in the future, {xiongdi} will contact me with the voice transmission.
你将这阵发生的事情细细道来，龙湛看起来略显不悦地接受了你的解释。百里奇乘机奉还龙珠，龙湛的脸色这才好看了许多。¤You explained what happened in detail, and Long Zhan accepted your explanation with a slightly unhappy look. Bailiqi took the opportunity to return the Dragon Ball, and Long Zhan's face became much better.
我们问道楼除了出售法门神通还出售丹方，道友不妨看看？¤We asked the building not only to sell magical powers, but also to sell pills. Daoist friends, why not take a look?
你们这丹方也不便宜呢。¤This formula of yours is not cheap either.
道友别嫌弃丹方昂贵，这丹方除了记载了药材配比，还记录了前人对于丹道的感悟，阅读之后能够精进自身的丹道领悟。¤Daoist friends, don't dislike the expensive pill recipes. In addition to recording the ratio of medicinal materials, this pill recipe also records the predecessors' perceptions of the pill way. After reading it, you can improve your own Pill understanding.
你将草药纳入储物袋，心满意足地离开了。¤You put the herbs in your storage bag and left contentedly.
找死。¤Looking for death.
你与炎萧见到一人正以手中魔晶吸取周围的魔气。对方发现了你们。¤You and Yan Xiao saw a person is in the hands of the magic crystal to absorb the surrounding magic Qi. The other side found you.
同时，你似乎与九霄雷狱的空间节点产生了一缕微妙的共鸣，但细细探查又被海上狂暴的灵气风暴所阻。¤At the same time, you seem to have a subtle resonance with the spatial nodes of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, but a closer look is blocked by the violent aura storm at sea.
呼~看来现在还是难以找到这九霄雷狱之所在。¤Phew~ It seems that it is still difficult to find the location of this Nine Heavens Thunder Prison.
在你击散了雷灵之后，它的核心悬浮于水面之上。¤After you have dispersed the thunder spirit, its core hovers above the surface of the water.
虽是道道雷电直击肉身，但层层暗劲却难奈何你。¤Although the thunderbolt strikes directly at your flesh, the layers of dark energy can hardly help you.
就便是吸收雷晶后，所领悟的锻体法门吧。¤This is the body forging technique that I have learned after absorbing the thunder crystal.
核心倏地一下钻入了你的掌心，你似乎和先天灵气建立了某种联系。¤The core burrows abruptly into your palm and you seem to establish some kind of connection with the innate aura.
你奋力斩杀了毒虫，采摘了不少谷内灵药后转身离开此地。¤You fought hard to kill the poisonous insects, and after picking up a lot of Pill in the valley, you turned and left here.
你实力不济，根本不敌此毒虫。你咬咬牙，放弃了采摘灵药的念头直接离开了山谷。¤You are not strong enough to match this poisonous insect. You gritted your teeth, gave up the idea of ​​picking Pill and left the valley directly.
对方头也不回的跑了。¤The opponent ran away without looking back.
算了，放他走了，免得和竹山宗结下大仇。¤Forget it, let him go, so as not to forge a big feud with Bamboo Mountain Sect.
奇怪，此处土属性灵气并不浓郁，为何会有三星石出现？¤Strange, the earth attribute aura is not strong here, why is there a three-star stone?
咳咳...这，老夫也只是再翻阅古籍时见过，想完全读懂还是有些困难。¤Cough cough... This, the old man has only seen it when he was flipping through ancient books, and it is still a little difficult to fully understand it.
看，这石头上似乎刻着什么文字？三星石坚硬异常且不容易被风化，古人常用此记录一些重要事件。你且把它擦干净试试。¤Look, what words seem to be engraved on this stone? The three-star stone is extremely hard and not easy to be weathered, and the ancients often used it to record some important events. You try to wipe it clean.
你施展了一个水枪术，三星石的表面瞬间便被冲刷干净，露出了一个个晦涩难懂的文字。¤You cast a Water gun, and the surface of the three-star stone was instantly washed away, revealing obscure words one by one.
你认识这些字？¤Do you know these words?
算了算了，那就先收着吧。说不定以后能遇到看得懂这些古代文字的人呢。¤Forget it, let's take it first. Maybe in the future, I will meet people who can understand these ancient characters.
这……竟是上古时期的文字！¤This... is actually a text from the ancient times!
这是...三星石？¤This is... a three-star stone?
你赢了。¤You win.
焦师弟，你的功力也大有长进，我观你的修为已经快要达到瓶颈期了，这次又得了一颗筑基丹，等这次回去便好好准备一下闭关筑基的事情吧。¤Brother Jiao, your skill has also improved a lot. I think your cultivation is about to reach the bottleneck. Since you recieved a Foundation Pill. When you go back, you should begin your breakthrough preperations.
一名竹山宗的巡逻弟子从前方经过，但因为修为太低，并没有发现你的存在。¤A patrol disciple of the Bamboo Mountain Sect passed by, but because his cultivation level was too low, he didn't notice your existence.
站住！此地竹山宗所属，闲杂人等速速离去！¤Stop! This place belongs to the Bamboo Mountain Sect, and the idlers leave at the same speed!
道友功力深厚，在下佩服。¤Taoist fellows have profound skills, and I admire them.
哦？你也出来找猎物啊？¤Oh? Are you looking for prey too?
钟师弟，白帝即将渡劫飞升，我此番前来是受他之托，邀请炎麟道友届时前往观礼。¤Brother Zhong, the White Emperor is about to ascend through the tribulation, and I am here at his request to invite Daoist Brother Yan Lin to observe the ceremony at that time.
钟师兄，白帝即将渡劫飞升，我此番前来是受他之托，邀请炎麟前辈届时前往观礼。¤Brother Zhong, the White Emperor is about to ascend through the tribulation, and I have come here at his request to invite Senior Yan Lin to attend the ceremony.
那此事便拜托钟师兄了。¤Then this matter is in the hands of Senior Brother Zhong.
不过师尊如今闭关未出，只得等师尊神游而归，才能将此事告知了。¤However, the Master is now in seclusion and has not yet left, so I will have to wait until he returns from his divine journey before I can tell him about this.
那此事便拜托钟师弟了。¤Then I will leave this matter to Senior Brother Zhong.
原来是白帝前辈要飞升了，这的确是一件大事。按师尊与前辈的交情，到时候一定会去捧场的。¤It turns out that Senior White Emperor is about to ascend, which is indeed a big event. According to senior's friendship with senior, he will definitely be there to support him when the time comes.
早知道就先去那采筠阁买上一手情报，花点小钱也好过竹篮打水。¤If I knew it, I would go to Caiyun Pavilion to buy some information. It's better to spend a little money than to fetch water with a bamboo basket.
这次出海运气可真差，大半年的时间也没打到几件值钱的材料。¤This time, the sea freight is really bad. I haven't gotten a few valuable materials in more than half a year.
哼，都是些不值钱的玩意儿。¤Huh, these are worthless things.
不必担心，这里的事情我都已经听说了，我这次正是为此而来。¤Don't worry, I've heard about everything here, and I'm here for this this time.
平日里来侵扰村庄的大多是些灵智未开的野兽，完全不是你的对手。偶有妖兽出现，也被你轻松驱赶。如此一个月后，终于不再有妖兽出现了。¤On weekdays, most of the beasts that invade the village are witless beasts. They are not your opponents at all. Occasionally, monsters appear and are easily driven away by you. After such a month, finally no monsters appear.
仙师您这边请，我这就让大家帮您准备休息的房间。¤Great Celestial, please this way, I will let everyone help you prepare a rest room.
你一边说着，一边挥手将这些草药装进了储物袋中，然后不再搭理身后那些绝望的村民，扭头便离开了这里。¤While you were talking, you waved these herbs into the storage bag, then ignored the desperate villagers behind you, turned your head and left here.
仙师大人...村子里虽然拿不出什么特别值钱的东西，但平日里大家上山打猎，也收集不少草药和材料。仙师要是感兴趣的话，统统都可以拿去！¤Great Celestial...Although the village does not have much of value, everyone goes hunting in the mountains and collects a lot of herbs and materials. If you are interested, you can take them all!
仙师大人，这是我们能拿出来的全部了，请您一定要帮帮我们啊！¤Great Celestial, this is all we can bring out, please help us!
要除去这些妖兽并不难，但我的时间可金贵的很。我凭什么为了你们这些凡人，在这里等上十天半月？¤It is not difficult to remove these monsters, but my time is very expensive. Why should I wait here for ten and a half days for you mortals?
这里是附近比较大的一处村落，远远望去屋舍成群，但大都房门紧闭，街道上也冷冷清清，没有几个人待在外面。¤This is a relatively large village nearby. I can see a group of houses from a distance, but most of the houses are closed and the streets are deserted. Few people stay outside.
多谢大人，多谢大人！¤Thank you sir, thank you sir!
你略施法术，便在指尖凝聚了一团灵气火焰。¤You just cast a spell, and you gather a group of spiritual energy flames at your fingertips.
不错，区区低阶妖兽，也只敢侵扰你们这些普通凡人。要解决它们，对于我来说并不是什么难事。¤Yes, low-level monsters only dare to invade you ordinary mortals. It is not difficult for me to solve them.
接下去的一段时间，你被村民们安顿在村中最大的房子休息，村庄虽然贫困，但每日都会拿出最好东西款待你。¤In the next period of time, you will be settled in the biggest house in the village by the villagers. Although the village is poor, you will be treated with the best things every day.
哦？拿来看看。¤Oh? Take a look.
您...您是仙师大人？¤You... are you Great Celestial?
最近村子里已经有好几人死在这些妖兽的利爪之下，大家现在都人心惶惶，不敢出门。请仙师大人一定要救救我们啊！¤Recently, several people in the village have died under the claws of these monsters. Everyone is panicked and dare not go out. Please Lord Immortal must save us!
你对这些低阶的草药不屑一顾，不再搭理身后那些绝望的村民，扭头便离开了。¤You dismissed these low-level herbs, stopped paying attention to the desperate villagers behind you, turned your head and left.
村民们拼拼凑凑，拿出了三十余株一品的低阶草药。数量虽然不少，但都不是什么值钱的东西。¤The villagers pieced together and came up with more than 30 single-grade low-level herbs. Although there are a lot of them, they are not valuable things.
这位{xiongdi}，天快黑了，你还是快些回家吧。这段时间附近不太平，要是撞到了妖兽可就麻烦了。¤This {xiongdi}, it’s getting dark soon, so you should go home soon. It’s not peaceful around this time. If you hit a monster, it will be troublesome.
你放心，我一定帮你们村子除掉这些祸害，这也是我们这些正道修仙者的本分。¤Don't worry, I will help your village get rid of these scourges. This is also our duty of righteous cultivators.
几经波折，众人终于回到了岫络谷，但也有一些修为不高或因为别的原因没有来得及逃出来的人，永远地留在了那里。¤After several twists and turns, everyone finally returned to Xiuluo Valley, but there were also some people who hadn't had time to escape because of other reasons, and stayed there forever.
就连几位元婴修为的大能也有一些狼狈，对比进入古迹时岫络谷中热闹的景象，此时不免有些凄凉。¤Even the great powers of the Nascent Soul's cultivation base are a little embarrassed. Compared with the lively scene in the Xiuluo Valley when entering the historic site, it can't help but feel a little bleak at this time.
他手上水灵气若隐若现，显然已经开始酝酿攻击。¤The aura of water in his hand is looming, and he has obviously begun to attack.
龙湛长老，龙族到底为何对百里家穷追不舍？¤Elder Long Zhan, why on earth is the Dragon Clan pursuing the Baili Family relentlessly?
许是化形的龙族，{FirstName}{xiongdi}，多加提防。¤Xu is a transformed dragon, {FirstName}{xiongdi}, beware.
你又是何人？¤Who are you?
无妨¤No problem
你们试图偏离航线，但那人却如蛆附骨般紧紧跟随着你们。¤You tried to deviate from the course, but the man followed you like a maggot attached to a bone.
长老，等等！¤Elder, wait!
哈哈哈，好一个不分青红皂白。你们百里族人心机狡诈，背信弃义，在碎星岛对我龙族出手，居然还有脸来化龙海撒野？¤Hahaha, it's so indiscriminate. You Baili people are cunning and treacherous, attacking my Dragon Race on Broken Star Island, so you still have the face to turn the Dragon Sea into the wild?
真是奇怪，寻常修士虽擅御剑而行却也鲜少在这无尽之海中只身出行，莫非此人打算借浪潮炼体吗？¤It's really strange. Although ordinary cultivators are good at swordsmanship, they rarely travel alone in this endless sea. Does this person plan to use the wave to refine their bodies?
他手上灵气若隐若现，显然已经开始酝酿攻击。¤The spiritual energy in his hand is looming, and he has obviously begun to attack.
我们来这里只是想调查当年之事的原委，若是再添新仇恨，也实非我的本意。¤We are here just to investigate what happened in the past. If we add new hatred, it is not my intention.
百里兄，是那些龙族不分青红皂白便对我们出手，我们总不能任人宰割。¤Brother Baili, those dragons attacked us indiscriminately. We can't be slaughtered.
哈哈哈，你同百里小儿一并在化龙海域撒野，竟连此处主人都认不出来吗？¤Hahaha, you and Baili Xiaoer went wild in the Dragonborn Sea, even the owner here can't recognize it?
哼，不管怎么说你二人当日打伤龙湛之事本座无法置之不理！¤Hmph, anyway, you two injured Long Zhan that day, I can't ignore it!
不多时，龙湛阴郁的面色稍微缓和了些，看向你们的眼光也没有了浓重的杀气。¤In a short while, Long Zhan's gloomy complexion eased a little, and the eyes that looked at you did not have a strong murderous aura.
本座乃龙族四长老龙湛，知晓老夫名号也好叫你们做个明白鬼。¤This seat belongs to Long Zhan, the fourth elder of the dragon clan. Knowing the name of the old man will make you a ghost.
看来你们并非为世仇而来，年轻人。¤It seems that you are not here for feuds, young people.
先前被你击退的小龙突然从海中跃出，小声地与面前的龙湛说着什么。¤The little dragon that was repelled by you before suddenly jumped out of the sea, whispering something to Long Zhan in front of him.
本座乃龙族四长老龙湛，知晓老夫名号也好叫你们做个明白鬼。百里族氏之人心机狡诈，背信弃义，我龙族断不会放过任何一个贼子后人！¤This seat is Long Zhan, the fourth elder of the dragon clan, and knowing the name of the old man will make you a ghost. The people of the Baili clan are cunning and treachery. My dragon clan will never let any thief descendants!
幼龙发出一声悲鸣，你将法宝收回，顺势一掌将它击退。¤The young dragon uttered a mournful cry. You took the magic weapon back and knocked it back with a palm.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你没事吧。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, are you all right.
废话少说，真当我不知道你们在碎星岛上打伤龙昌海之事吗！¤Stop talking nonsense, I really didn't know that you injured Long Changhai on Broken Star Island!
百里兄，你看前方海浪中是否有人？¤Brother Baili, do you see anyone in the waves ahead?
看样子，此人或许来者不善。¤It seems that this person may be a bad person.
幼龙发出一声悲鸣，你挥剑将它的龙头斩下。¤The young dragon uttered a mournful cry, and you swung your sword to cut off its dragon head.
果然是龙族！¤It really is a dragon!
你们权衡之下决定停下灵舟，询问那位修士的意图。¤After weighing it, you decided to stop the spirit boat and ask the cultivator's intentions.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，手下留情。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, be merciful.
灵舟逐渐前行，那人仿佛一直等待着你们般在原地静静地注视着灵舟。¤The spirit boat is moving forward gradually, and the person is watching the spirit boat quietly as if waiting for you all the time.
你们行至化龙海域深处，白浪翻涌间你似乎看见一人负手立于浪中。¤You go to the depths of the Dragonborn Sea, and you seem to see a person standing in the middle of the waves while the white waves are turning.
不外乎一战，难不成你我合力还斗不过他一人吗？¤It's nothing more than a battle. Is it possible that you and I can't fight him alone if we work together?
哎...原本我只是想调查当年家族之事的原委，如和龙族又新添仇恨，实在非我本意。¤Hey... Originally, I just wanted to investigate some family affairs back then. It wasn't my intention to start an enmity with the dragon clan.
请问道友可是在海中迷失方向了？¤May I ask fellow Taoists lost their way in the sea?
哈哈哈，好一个不分青红皂白。你们百里族人心机狡诈，背信弃义，在碎星岛对我龙族出手，现在居然还有脸来化龙海撒野？¤Hahaha, it's so indiscriminate. You Baili people are scheming and treacherous, attacking my Dragons on Broken Star Island, and now you still have the face to turn the Dragon Sea into the wild?
火墙也不知何时开始转化为青、苍、赤三色交杂，与之倾轧的玄紫色的神通不像之前还能与之分庭抗礼，而是节节败退，甚至连阵法空间也因承受不住而趋于崩溃。¤The wall of fire also does not know when it began to transform into a mixture of green, pale, red, and pouring with the Xuan purple divine power unlike before can still be separated from it, but defeated, and even the formation space also tends to collapse because it can not withstand.
你和炎萧为防这魔修偷袭，只好以神识为眼向那玄紫色魔气中探查，不，如今连玄紫色的光芒也消失殆尽，那魔修原在地方只剩下黑暗，张牙舞爪地，像是随时要吞噬你二人的黑暗。¤You and Yan Xiao in order to prevent this evil cultivator sneak attack, had to use the soul sense as the eye to that xuan purple magic gas to explore, no, now even the xuan purple light has disappeared, that the evil cultivator original place only darkness, open teeth and claws, like the darkness that will devour you two at any time.
没有...我又尝试了联系其他人，但都没有回复...就好像，传音符失效了。¤No... I tried to contact the others again, but there was no reply... It's like, the voice transmission charm failed.
你在自言自语时，一道算不上虚弱但带着些疲惫的声音出现在你耳边。¤You are talking to yourself when a voice that is not weak but with some fatigue appears in your ears.
转过身来，刚好看见炎萧终于是因长时间高强度战斗结束，而因此绷紧的精神也突然放松，乃至昏迷过去倒向海中。¤Turn around, just to see Yan Xiao is finally due to the end of a long period of high-intensity combat, and therefore tense spirit also suddenly relaxed, and even faint past fall into the sea.
至于天魔眼，这么久都没出过问题，料想也只是白帝发现了什么苗头，让你去排查下隐患而已。况且回宁州还需要些时日，也不差这一天半日。¤As for the Heavenly Devil's Eye, so long there has been no problem, it is expected that only the White Emperor found the first signs of something, let you go to check the hidden danger. Besides, it will take some time to return to Ning Province, and it's not bad for a day and a half.
伴随着那足以破浪分海的神通远去后，一声惨叫传来，这场以少胜多的战斗也是宣告结束。¤With that enough to break the waves and divide the sea after far away, a miserable scream came, this battle with less than many is also declared the end.
你废话太多了。¤You talk too much nonsense.
一舟俩人，就此离开这片海域。¤One boat and two people, this leaves this sea.
这天魔道修士虽仗着阵法的威能在战斗时对你造成了些许麻烦，但毕竟综合实力相比你还是差很多，很快便是败下阵来，并在你的猛烈攻势下连元婴都被绞杀，只留残躯无力地掉入海中。¤Although this Heavenly Demon Dao cultivator caused you some trouble during the battle with the power of the formation, but after all, the overall strength is still much worse than you, and soon lost the battle, and under your fierce attack even the original baby was strangled, leaving only the remnants of the body helplessly fall into the sea.
疲惫这种状态本不应该出现在元婴修士身上。但，没错，炎萧虽然脱离了昏迷状态，可现在也算不上好过多少。¤Fatigue such a state should not have appeared in the YuanYing cultivator. But, yes, although Yan Xiao is out of the coma state, but now it is not much better.
这元婴期魔修虽是境界压你一头，但实战能力远不如你，更不用说她与炎萧鏖战已久，早就后继乏力。¤This YuanYing stage evil cultivator although the realm presses you head, but the actual combat ability is far inferior to you, not to mention she and Yan Xiao fierce battle has been a long time, long after the weakness.
你轻笑一声，将下落中的炎萧扛在肩上，随后便是寻一小岛供炎萧修养去了。¤You laughed lightly and carried the falling Yan Xiao on your shoulders, then it was to find a small island for Yan Xiao to recuperate.
呵，即便你击杀那俩人，但也已经遍体鳞伤，想必此时不过是强弩之末。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're doing.
但我此前曾...去过天魔眼，不知...是否于此有关联。¤But I had previously... I don't know if... I don't know if it's related to this.
磔磔磔，我还以为是哪方大能，连我天魔道的闲事都敢管。结果就这点实力？¤I thought it was a great power, even my heavenly demon dao's idle affairs dare to care. So this is all the strength you have?
而炎萧前些时候发现你在战斗中占了上风，也是不在保留，硬抗一记神通后拼着重伤击杀了对敌的一个魔修。¤And Yan Xiao found out some time ago that you had the upper hand in the battle and was not holding back, fighting hard against a divine power and then killing one of the opposing evil cultivators with a serious injury.
你并没有理会这魔修的嘲笑，只是在默默地吸收灵气，试图在被击杀之前再挣扎一番。¤You don't pay any attention to the evil cultivator's mockery, but are just silently absorbing aura, trying to struggle some more before being killed.
你晃了晃脑袋，仔细一想炎萧在这大阵之中与三个同阶魔修缠斗如此之久，只怕早已是强弩之末，却还能坚持到现在，换做是你战后的状态只怕也好不到哪去。¤You shake your head, think carefully Yan Xiao in this formation and three of the same class evil cultivator tangled for so long, only afraid that has long been the end of the strong, but still able to hold on to the present, replaced by your state after the war is not good to go.
有回复么？¤There is a reply?
但你又怎会让他得逞。¤But how can you let him have his way.
炎萧{$ChenHu}，多谢...炎萧{$ChenHu}?¤Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}, many thanks... Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}?
先不提这魔修的神通功法诡谲异常，令人难以应对，单是那阵法便已是让你十分头疼。¤Not to mention that the devil cultivator's magic techniques are treacherous and difficult to deal with, the formation alone is already a big headache for you.
以至于他说完顿了片刻，像是大病初愈的凡人般，缓了口气才继续说下去。¤So much so that he paused for a moment after finishing, like a mortal recovering from a serious illness, and slowed his breath before continuing.
（但为何天魔道会知道炎萧{$ChenHu}的行踪呢...）¤(But why would the Heavenly Demon Road know the whereabouts of Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}...)
当你的神识触及到那片黑暗中心时，却什么都没有发现，或者说除浓重到让人不适的魔气外，什么都没有，连阵法都已是支离破碎。¤When your soul sense touched the center of that darkness, but found nothing, or nothing except a demonic aura so thick that it was uncomfortable, and even the formation was already in pieces.
（虽说可能只是巧合...但若是我的推测没错，魔门随时会入侵宁州，现在可不能再浪费时间了！得赶紧用传音符通知倪兄或是白帝楼才行！）¤(Although it may just be a coincidence... But if my speculation is correct, the devil door will invade Ning Province at any time, now can not waste any more time! Have to hurry to use the voice transmission talisman to notify Ni brother or White Emperor House to do!)
玄紫色魔气疯狂地肆虐着，却被一面夹杂着些许青色的赤色火墙隔离开，无法伤你分毫。¤The Xuan purple devil gas rampaged madly, but was separated by a wall of crimson fire interspersed with a little cyan, unable to hurt you in the slightest.
在天魔眼取出的东西？¤In the eye of the heavenly devil to take out the thing?
事实也是如此，你凝集自身最后的灵气，一道不起眼的神通穿越火墙而去，伴随着那魔修的一声惨叫和阵法空间的彻底崩圮，这场艰巨的战斗终于是彻底结束了。¤The truth is also true, you condense your own last aura, an insignificant Avatar through the wall of fire and go, along with a scream of that evil cultivator and the complete collapse of the formation space, this arduous battle is finally completely over.
。但事与愿违，仅凭这一击，便让他丧失了抵抗能力，向咆哮着的海面坠去，半途又被炎萧补上几记神通，化作飞灰散去。¤. But things are not as they should be, and with this blow alone, he lost his ability to resist and fell toward the roaring sea, halfway down the road and was complemented by Yan Xiao with a few divine powers, turning into flying ash and scattering.
这魔修本就不是你对手，现下更是没有了阵法加持，很快便是败下阵来，并在你的猛烈攻势下连元婴都被绞杀，只留残躯无力地掉入海中。¤This evil cultivator was already no match for you, and now without the support of the formation, he was soon defeated, and under your fierce attack, even the firstborn was strangled, leaving only the remnants of his body to fall helplessly into the sea.
也好。先用传音符联系白帝楼吧。¤It is also good. Let's first contact the White Emperor House with the voice transmission talisman.
虽说事先已经破除那阵法，但这魔修的神通功法诡谲异常，让你不知该如何应对，坚持一会后便是败下阵来。¤Although the formation has been broken beforehand, but the devil cultivator's magical techniques are treacherous and unusual, so you do not know how to deal with it, persist for a while is defeated.
你以神识确定那魔修身死后，拖着疲惫的身躯，轻唤炎萧两声，却是无人回答。¤After you determine the death of the evil cultivator with soul sense, dragging a tired body, lightly called Yan Xiao two times, but no one answered.
满不在乎地擦了一把脸上的血痕后，炎萧淡淡地摇了摇头。¤After wiping a handful of blood marks on his face with carelessness, Yan Xiao faintly shook his head.
你！你不是...这...这是！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤You! You are not... It's... This is!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
最后残留的魔修眼见大势已去，不知是驱动了何种秘法，引动着阵法内的魔气向他奔涌而去。而他的身影也是由之前阴暗难辨渐渐变得玄紫色光芒大盛。¤The last remaining evil cultivator, seeing that the momentum was gone, did not know what kind of secret method he was driving, drawing the demonic qi within the formation to rush towards him. And his figure is also from the previous gloomy indistinguishable gradually become Xuan purple light blooming.
炎萧点点头，表示没有异议。¤Yan Xiao nodded his head, indicating that he had no objection.
（糟了！！）{vpunch=10,0.5}¤(Oh no!!!) {vpunch=10,0.5}
炎萧身上本已熄灭的火焰再次腾起而后便冲向黑暗，但显然是之前消耗过大了，之前隔着阵法都能看到的火光，现在却只是如同薄膜一般，堪堪覆盖在他皮肤的表面而已，速度也是不及之前。¤The flame on Yan Xiao's body that had been extinguished once again rose up and then rushed towards the darkness, but apparently it was too consumed before, the fire light that could be seen through the formation before was now just like a thin film that could only cover the surface of his skin, and the speed was not as fast as before.
可能是用于炼制某种丹药吧。¤Probably for refining some kind of Pill.
神识已经感知不到那魔修的气息，应该是成功将他斩杀了。¤The soul sense can no longer perceive the breath of that evil cultivator, should have succeeded in killing him.
转过身来，刚好看见炎萧终于是因长时间高强度战斗而昏迷，正倒向海中。¤Turning around, just saw Yan Xiao finally was unconscious from the long and intense battle and was falling into the sea.
以致于他说完顿了片刻，在你有些担心他状态时才挥挥手示意自己还好，而后继续说下去。¤So much so that he finished pausing for a moment, in you some worry about his state before waving his hand to indicate that he is okay, and then continue to say.
最后残留的魔修眼见大势已去，躲开炎萧一击后便是要施展秘术离去。¤The last remaining evil cultivator saw that the momentum was gone, and after dodging Yan Xiao's blow was to cast a secret technique to leave.
及至重伤的炎萧抽身冲出之时，你们身前的黑暗，以及刚逃出不远的魔修都是被你的神通刺破。¤By the time the seriously injured Yan Xiao drew himself out, the darkness in front of you, as well as the evil cultivator who had just escaped a short distance away, were pierced by your divine power.
于是数次交锋后，很快便败下阵来，连元婴都被绞杀，只留下一朵残躯入海中时产生的浪花，见证着你跨越大境界击杀魔修的壮举。¤So after several encounters, you were soon defeated, and even the firstborn was strangled, leaving only a remnant body into the sea when the waves generated, witnessing your feat of killing the evil cultivator across the great realm.
你并没有理会这魔修的嘲笑，只是在默默地吸收阵法中微薄到难以感应的灵气，试图在被击杀之前再挣扎一番。¤You do not pay attention to the ridicule of this evil cultivator, just in silence to absorb the formation in the thin to hard to sense aura, trying to be killed before struggling some more.
眼下这情况不如带着昏迷过去的炎萧先修养几日。¤The current situation is better to take the unconscious Yan Xiao to recuperate for a few days.
没了那阵法，这三个魔修对于你和炎萧来说也不具备人数优势，自然是无法弥补这元婴期与化神期之间的巨大鸿沟。¤Without that formation, these three evil cultivators do not have numerical advantage over you and Yan Xiao, and naturally cannot bridge the huge gap between the YuanYing stage and the Deity Transformation stage.
一个闪身便是要截去他退路，更不用说人还未至，神通已经临身！¤A dash is to cut off his retreat, not to mention the person has not yet arrived, the Avatar has already come!
不好！他是要跑！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Not good! He is going to run! {vpunch=10,0.5}
嗯，门内老祖此前命我从天魔眼和这雷鸣海寻觅些材料回去，但没说作何用，只说是机密。¤Well, the door ancestor previously ordered me to find some materials from the sky devil eye and this thunder sea back, but did not say for what use, only that it is confidential.
而炎萧似乎是有些担心你好心相助却被魔修击杀，以一敌二时不再保留。此前更是硬抗一记神通后拼着重伤击杀了对敌的一个魔修。¤And Yan Xiao seems to be a little worried about your kindness to help but was killed by the evil cultivator, to one against two when no longer reserved. Previously, it is hard to resist a divine power after fighting a serious injury to kill the opponent of a evil cultivator.
只听“轰”的一声，这神通在你身前猛地爆开。¤Just hear the 'boom' sound, the Avatar in front of your body burst open violently.
火墙后，你身前，一个浴血的身影挺立于此。¤After the fire wall, in front of you, a blood-soaked figure stands erect here.
你将自己此行的目的向炎萧简单地叙述了一番，从白帝派你去天魔眼调查说起，慢慢的，后者的表情也是逐渐凝重起来。待你讲完自己的猜想时，炎萧的脸上早已是寒如冰霜。¤You will be the purpose of their trip to Yan Xiao briefly recounted, from the white emperor sent you to investigate the sky demon eye, slowly, the latter's expression is also gradually gaze up. By the time you finished telling your conjecture, Yan Xiao's face was already as cold as frost.
闻言，炎萧陷入短暂的沉思。¤At these words, Yan Xiao fell into a short period of contemplation.
至于天魔眼，这么久都没出过问题，料想也只是白帝发现了什么苗头，让你去排查下隐患而已。况且回宁州还需要些时日，也不差这几日。¤As for the heavenly devil's eye, so long there has been no problem, I think it is only the White Emperor found the first signs of something, let you go to check the hidden danger. Besides, it will take some time to go back to Ning Province, and it's not bad for a few days.
抱歉，我来晚了。¤Sorry, I'm late.
嘴角还挂着淡笑。¤The corners of his mouth still had a faint smile on it.
但你在开口之时便是急速凝聚灵气，话音还未落神通早已出手。¤But when you open your mouth is the rapid condensation of aura, the words have not yet fallen divine power has long struck.
你猜的没错。但我也不知道自己是如何惹上天魔道的。¤You guessed right. But I don't know how I got into trouble with the Heavenly Demon Dao.
别了，多管闲事的...废物。¤Don't, nosy... Wanker.
可此前被炎萧救下的你早已缓过气来，虽还有些余力不足，但趁他丧失斗志时补上一刀还是可以做到的。¤But previously saved by Yan Xiao, you have long since slowed down, although there is still some residual power, but take advantage of his loss of fighting spirit to make up a knife or can do.
说是光芒，但阵法内甚至比之前更加昏暗，连元婴修士这种身具移山覆海之能的存在都难以视物。¤Said light, but within the formation even more dim than before, even the YuanYing cultivator such as the body with the ability to move mountains and cover the sea of existence is difficult to see things.
（天魔道的人不但能在无尽之海上准确地找到他，还派了不止一名元婴修士前来，要么是两方有旧怨，要么...便是炎萧在天魔眼中取出了什么物事，让天魔道分外关心罢。）¤(The people of the Heavenly Demon Road were not only able to find him accurately on the Endless Sea, but also sent more than one YuanYing cultivator to come, either because the two sides have old grudges, or... It is Yan Xiao took out something in the eyes of the Heavenly Demon, so that the Heavenly Demon Road is extra concerned about it.)
（若天魔道表面对中州施压，引玄道宗老祖前往援助，而师兄不在，五行宗门底蕴不出...若是派元婴巅峰强者携什么强力秘宝前来偷袭，仅凭玄道宗只怕麻痹大意之下可能一时三刻间天魔眼深处的封印便会告破。）¤(If the Heavenly Demon Dao surface pressure on the Central State, attracting the Mystic Dao Sect's oldest ancestor to go to the aid, and the absence of senior brother, the bottom of the Five Elements Sect is not out... If the peak of the YuanYing strong person with what powerful secret treasure to come to sneak attack, only with the Mystic Dao clan is afraid that under paralysis and carelessness may be a moment or three deep in the heavenly devil eye seal will be broken.)
你晃了晃脑袋，仔细一样炎萧在这大阵之中与三个同阶魔修缠斗如此之久，只怕早已是强弩之末，却还能坚持到现在，换做是你只怕早已身死道消。¤You shake your head, carefully the same Yan Xiao in the middle of this big formation and three of the same class evil cultivator tangled for so long, only afraid that has long been the end of the strong, but still able to persist until now, replaced by you only afraid that has long been the death of the road.
但显然他并不打算给你任何机会，这魔修周身玄紫芒闪耀之间，将要用来灭杀你的神通已是准备完成，随时准备出手。¤But obviously he doesn't intend to give you any chance, this evil cultivator's body is surrounded by a flash of Xuan purple aura, the divine ability that will be used to kill you is already prepared and ready to strike.
那我们只能尽快赶回去了。迟，则生变。¤Then we can only rush back as soon as possible. If we are late, there will be changes.
炎萧忍不住一声怒骂，却引动了自身经络伤势，疼得他一口鲜血夹杂着灵气喷出，气势又萎靡了下去。¤Yan Xiao could not resist a cursing, but triggered his own meridian injuries, painful to him a mouthful of blood mixed with aura sprayed out, the momentum and wilted down.
炎萧{$ChenHu}，那些天魔道的修士为何会在此围杀...炎萧{$ChenHu}？¤Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}, why are those cultivators of the Heavenly Demon Dao here to surround and kill... Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}?
而远处原本围攻他的两名魔修，此刻已是化为冰柱正落入海中。随之出现的两朵浪花作为他俩存在于世的最后见证，也只是快速地消失在波澜不止的无尽海中。¤The two evil cultivators that originally surrounded him in the distance are now turned into icicles that are falling into the sea. The two waves that followed as the last witness to their existence in the world, but also just quickly disappeared in the endless sea of waves.
你轻笑一声，拉住正在下落的炎萧，随后便是寻一小岛供炎萧修养去了。¤You laughed lightly and pulled Yan Xiao, who was falling, and then was looking for a small island for Yan Xiao to recuperate.
你们从储物袋召唤出灵舟，而后背向那被晕渲成玄紫色的海浪拍打着的深蓝色无尽之海。¤You summoned the spirit boat from your storage bag, and then turned your back towards the endless deep blue sea that was lapped by the waves that were haloed in violet.
那魔修终于意识到己方大势已去，转身运起遁术便想要逃亡。¤The evil cultivator finally realized that his side's momentum had gone, turned around and tried to flee by using the evasion technique.
你本对自己实力很有自信才选择插手战斗，但这天魔道修士的战斗力却超乎你的想象。¤You were confident in your own strength before you chose to intervene in the battle, but the combat power of this Heavenly Devil Dao cultivator is beyond your imagination.
那阵法虽是有些烦人，但这几个魔修与炎萧鏖战已久，本就已是后力难继，更不用说人数上的些微优势完全无法弥补元婴境和化神境的巨大鸿沟。¤That formation is a bit annoying, but these few evil cultivators and Yan Xiao fierce battle has been a long time, it is already difficult to continue, not to mention the slight advantage in numbers can not make up for the huge gap between the Nascent Soul realm and the Deity Transformation realm.
（炎萧去过天魔眼一事本应只有玄道宗的相关人士知道，若他是为门派奔波，也只是再加上离火门的掌门等人知晓。）¤(The fact that Yan Xiao had been to the Heavenly Demon Eye should only be known to the people involved in the Mystic Dao Sect, and if he was running around for the sect, it would only be known to the head of the Heavenly Fire Gate and others.)
话语落下的同时，一抹玄紫色已是尖啸着向你飞来！¤As the words fell, a flash of Xuan purple was already flying towards you with a sharp whistle!
你猜的没错...但我也不太清楚天魔道，为何会在海上追杀我...不但出动多位元婴修士...还步下如此阵法。¤You guessed right... But I'm not quite sure why the Heavenly Demon Dao is chasing me at sea... Not only did they send out many YuanYing cultivators... They also set up such a formation.
嗯，是极为精纯的灵核，而且此物由于与被封印的天魔息息相关，极为罕见，有些不凡的用处。但我也只是奉命行事，具体有何作用也不太清除。¤Well, it's an extremely pure spirit core, and it's extremely rare and of some extraordinary use because it's closely related to the sealed Heavenly Demon. But I was only acting on orders, what exactly does it do is not too clear.
所以天魔道的人并不是盯上你，而是从天魔眼取出的材料。¤So the people of the Heavenly Devil Dao are not staring at you, but the materials taken out from the Heavenly Devil Eye.
我唯一能想到的可能，就是此事与我此前在天魔眼取出的东西有关。¤The only thing I can think of is that the matter is related to what I took out in the heavenly demon eye earlier.
这次算你走运，但我天魔道不会善罢甘休！¤You're lucky this time, but the Heavenly Demon Path will not rest in peace!
经久不息。¤Long time no rest.
你晃了晃脑袋，只好忍着因在受损经脉中强行吸收并运行灵气带来的不适感，而后强打起精神，将下坠中的炎萧拉住，就近寻一岛屿闭关修养去了。¤You shook your head, had to endure the discomfort caused by forcibly absorbing and running spiritual qi in the damaged meridians, and then strong spirit, will fall in Yan Xiao pulled, close to find an island to close down to recuperate.
（不无可能，但宁州古迹中历经了恒如真人的叛变后，宁州众派曾严厉排查奸细，如今时隔不久，只怕没那么容易再次被渗透。）¤(Not impossible, but after the mutiny of Heng Ru Zhen in the Ning Province monuments, the Ning Province sects had severely ranked the spies, now after a short time, only afraid that it is not so easy to be infiltrated again.)
眼下你尚还灵气枯竭，刚才的挣扎并未为你补充多少灵气，甚至不足以苟住一个脆弱的灵气屏障。只能眼睁睁地看着这催命符箓般的神通急速地缩短这并不太长的距离!¤Right now you are still depleted of aura, the struggle just now did not replenish much aura for you, not even enough to hold a fragile aura barrier. Can only watch the life talisman-like magic power to rapidly shorten the distance is not too long!
（凌轩师兄曾希望我去调查天魔眼，我只道是他发现了什么端倪，希望我去排查下隐患。但玄道宗老祖偶然离开，炎萧去过天魔眼后又遭遇袭击，让我感觉事情恐怕没那么简单。）¤(Brother Ling Xuan had wanted me to investigate the Heavenly Demon Eye, I only said that he had found some clues and wanted me to investigate the hidden problems. But the fact that the Mystic Dao Sect's oldest ancestor left by chance, and that Yan Xiao had been attacked after visiting the Heavenly Demon Eye, made me feel that things weren't that simple.)
你点点头，而后从储物袋中掏出传音符，将神识探入其中，熟稔地找出倪旭欣留下的神识印记后，便是发送了一段简短的提醒。¤You nod, and then pull out a voice transmission talisman from your storage bag, probe your soul sense into it, and after familiarly finding out the soul sense imprint left by Ni XuXin, you are sending a short reminder.
不如我先联系白帝楼倪旭欣兄弟，让他们提防着些天魔道。然后我们慢慢赶回宁州，不然以炎萧{$ChenHao}现在的伤势，即便回到宁州只怕也难以展现全部实力。¤Why don't I first contact the Ni XuXin brothers of the White Emperor Building and ask them to watch out for the Heavenly Demon Dao. Then we slowly rush back to Ning Province, otherwise with Yan Xiao {$ChenHao}'s current injuries, even back to Ning Province is difficult to show full strength.
哼，玄道宗的修士平时是趾高气扬了些，但这天魔道真以为我宁州无人不成？¤The cultivators of the Mystic Dao Sect are usually a little more arrogant, but does this Heavenly Demon Dao really think that there is no one in Ning Province?
那魔修显然是低估了你的实力，竟想硬抗这一击，而后遁去¤The evil cultivator apparently underestimated your strength and tried to resist the blow, and then disappeared!
趁着炎萧说话的功夫，你也开始沉思。¤While Yan Xiao was talking, you also began to ponder.
近乎等同于你走向陨落的距离！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Nearly equal to the distance you go to fall! {vpunch=10,0.5}
这元婴期天魔道修士即便是仗着阵法的威能，在你手下也不过坚持得久一点而已。数次交锋后很快便败下阵来，连元婴都被绞杀，只留下一朵残躯入海中时产生的浪花，见证着你跨越大境界击杀魔修的壮举。¤Even with the power of the formation, this YuanYing stage Heavenly Demon Dao practitioner can only last a little longer under you. After several encounters, he was quickly defeated, and even the firstborn was strangled, leaving only a remnant body into the sea when the waves, witnessing your feat of killing the evil cultivator across the great realm.
我怎么会惧你！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤How can I fear you!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
留下那玄紫色的海浪冲刷着的小岛。¤Leave that Xuan purple sea waves washing over the island.
嗯，由我来控制灵舟吧，炎萧{$ChenHu}还是尽快疗伤比较好。¤Well, let me control the spirit boat, Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} is better to heal as soon as possible.
于是轻描淡写地，未等魔修再伤炎萧分毫便已是全都被你解决。¤So lightly, before the evil cultivators hurt Yan Xiao a little bit again is all by you to solve.
（至于天魔道为何知晓炎萧的行踪...）¤(As for why the Heavenly Demon Road knows Yan Xiao's whereabouts ...)
{FirstName}道友，有什么事么？¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, what's the matter?
没想到竟被魔门之人钻了空子...这可如何是好......¤Unexpectedly, I was taken advantage of by the people of the Demon Sect...How can this be good...
这难道就是我派失传已久的《真元玄典》...！此功法我只在老祖的笔录中窥得一斑，没想到竟能在宁州古迹中觅得...！不过这笔录有些地方已经受到了磨损，恐怕还需要一些时间修复......¤Is this the Zhen Yuan Xuan Dian that Our Sect for a long time...! I only got a glimpse of this technique in the records of my ancestors. I didn't expect to find it in Ning Province's historic sites...! Some parts of this transcript have been worn out, I am afraid it will take some time to repair...
{FirstName}长老，有什么事么？¤Elder {FirstName}, what's the matter?
怎么样，马供奉的伤势严重么？¤How is it, is the injury of Guest Elder Ma serious?
我明白...马供奉这次伤及元神，没有数年时间的静养恐怕难以痊愈。¤I understand... I'm afraid that it will be difficult to heal without several years of rest and recuperation.
这段时间你们要多多留意，一有合适的人选，尽快告知与我。¤During this period of time, you should pay more attention, as soon as there is a suitable candidate, let me know as soon as possible.
马供奉已经服下了长老赐下的丹药，倒是没有性命之忧，只是...¤Guest Elder Ma has already taken the Pill given by the elders, but there is no fear for his life, just...
马供奉既然不能参加比试，那这混元仙体丹他自然也是无福消受了。这南崖城里出没的元婴期高手众多，有此仙丹在手，不愁找不到下一个供奉。¤Since Guest Elder Ma can not participate in the competition, this mixed immortal body pills he naturally is not blessed to accept. There are many YuanYing stage experts in this South Cliff City, with this immortal pellet in hand, there is no worry about finding the next offerer.
二长老，那后面的比试该怎么办？马供奉若无法参加比试，别说唐家，恐怕这次连白家的排名都会在我们之前啊。¤Second Elder, then what should we do about the later competition? If Guest Elder Ma is unable to participate in the competition, not to mention the Tang family, I'm afraid that even the Bai family's ranking will be ahead of us this time.
你便顺着气息搜寻了一番。在一处岩壁上，你发现了一根根奇特的藤曼，如暴起的青筋一般，沿着藤曼寻去，赫然是一颗如同心脏般的蓝色果实。¤You searched with your breath. On a rock wall, you found a peculiar vine man, like a burst of blue veins, along the vine man, it is a blue fruit like a heart.
所谓化龙劫，便是蛟龙在突破元婴时所引发的一次雷劫。若能成功突破，蛟龙便能精纯血脉，化为真龙。¤The so-called Dragon Transformation Tribulation is a thunder calamity caused by Jiaolong breaking through the Nascent Soul. If it can successfully break through, the Jiaolong will be able to purify its blood and turn into a real dragon.
原来如此……¤I see……
路过一处山峰时，你只觉得四周气息不同寻常，但又说不出个所以然。¤When passing a mountain peak, you only feel that the surrounding atmosphere is unusual, but you can't tell why.
老头，你能感受到这股气息麽？究竟是个什么来头？¤Old man, can you feel the breath? What is the origin?
路过一处山峰时，你只觉得血脉喷张，此处的气息似在唤醒你的血脉。¤When passing a mountain peak, you only feel the blood rushing out, and the breath here seems to wake up your blood.
这……倒是问到我了。且去四周找找，看能不能寻到什么线索。¤This... but asked me. And look around to see if you can find any clues.
化龙劫？那是什么？¤Transforming Dragon Tribulation? what is that?
此地竟然有龙皇果！真是不虚此行。¤There is actually a Dragon King Fruit here! Really worthwhile trip.
人类修士唯有突破飞升时才需渡过天劫，没想到蛟龙在金丹突破元婴时便要渡劫了，真是奇妙...¤Human cultivators only need to go through the catastrophe when they break through the ascension. I didn't expect that Jiaolong would go through the catastrophe when Jin Dan broke through the Nascent Soul. It's amazing...
龙皇果大多生长于龙气充溢之地，而这龙气，乃是蛟龙渡化龙劫时所产生。看来，此地曾是蛟龙渡劫之地，我们感受到的不同寻常的气息，便是所谓龙气了。¤Most of the dragon emperor fruit grows in the place full of dragon qi, and this dragon qi is produced when the dragon crosses the dragon calamity. It seems that this place was once the place where the Flood Dragon crossed the calamity, and the unusual aura we felt was the so-called dragon energy.
我猜，鲲族的体型之所以这么大，是因为施展吞噬神通后，体内积攒的灵气太多，而又无法直接炼化的原因。¤I guess the reason why the Kun clan is so big is because there is too much spiritual energy accumulated in the body after the devouring magical power is used, and it cannot be directly refined.
不过你恰好从他的体内破壁而出，等于打破了这鲲族的罩门。寻常修士受这点小伤倒是没什么，但对于这些鲲族来说，就很致命了。¤But you happened to break through the wall from his body, which is equivalent to breaking the door of this Kun clan. It's okay for ordinary cultivators to suffer from this small injury, but for these Kun clan, it is very fatal.
原来如此...体内灵气外泄，元气大伤。看来这浪方大圣是活不成了...¤It turned out to be like this... The spiritual energy in the body leaked out, and the vitality was greatly damaged. It seems that this great sage of Langfang will not survive...
哈哈哈，刚刚的大战动静不小，应该有不少修士正往这里赶。要是再不走的话，很快你斩杀浪方大圣的事迹便会传遍整片无尽之海了。¤Hahaha, the battle just now was not small, there should be a lot of cultivators rushing here. If you don't leave, your story of beheading the Great Sage Langfang will soon spread throughout the endless sea.
浪方巨大的身躯痛苦地翻滚着，在海面掀起数百米高的巨浪。与此同时，他的躯体竟开始以肉眼可见的速度缩小...¤Langfang's huge body rolled in pain, setting off huge waves hundreds of meters high on the sea. At the same time, his body began to shrink at a speed visible to the naked eye...
听说千流岛有支散修船队非要在四月出海，结果正撞上乱流，十几艘灵舟最后只开回去两艘。¤I heard that there was an independent cultivators' ship team on Qianliu Island who had to go to sea in April, but it was hitting a turbulent current. In the end, only two of a dozen spirit boats were driven back.
疼疼疼，你下手也忒重了点！¤It hurts, it hurts, your hands are a bit heavier!
啊哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈。¤Ahahahahahahahahahaha.
打不过你咋还跑了呢？¤Why did you run away if you couldn't beat it?
回合结束时若角色灵气数量大于上限，则需要丢弃灵气。\n{color=#d0380a}左键单击{/color}某属性灵气可选择消散一单位灵气。\n{color=#d0380a}右键单击{/color}某属性灵气可批量消散该属性灵气。¤At the end of the round if your character's Aura is greater than the maximum, you will need to discard it. \n{color=#d0380a}Left-click {/color} on an attribute of Aura to choose to dissipate one unit of Aura. \n{color=#d0380a}Right-click {/color} on an attribute of Aura to dissipate that attribute in bulk.
宁州古迹内危险重重，希望同门能相互守望。¤There are many dangers in the ancient ruins in Ning Province, and I hope that the same family can watch each other.
希望此次古迹之行能够找到帮助掌门突破化神之物......¤I hope this trip to the monuments will find something that will help the leader to break through the Deity Transformation stage...
近日总觉得宗门内有些弟子行踪诡异，难道是我多疑了么？¤Recently, I always feel that some disciples in the sect are going weird. Am I suspicious?
荧儿很期待看到你飞升时候的样子呢。¤Flux is looking forward to seeing you when you soar.
真正的飞升，是什么样子的呢...¤What does it look like to truly soar...
这妖王着实难缠，还是先准备一番再来吧。¤This demon king is really difficult to deal with, so let's prepare first.
这妖王着实难缠，赶紧回去复命吧。¤This demon king is really difficult to deal with, so hurry back and return to life.
魁首将获得一次前往太虚境参悟的机会。¤The leader will get a chance to go to the Great Void Dimension for enlightenment.
观战需要缴纳五千灵石作为座次费与客房费，道友确定要观战吗？¤You need to pay five thousand spirit stones as the seating and room fee to watch the battle, are you sure you want to watch the battle?

抱歉，只有境界达到金丹期或元婴期才有资格报名。¤Sorry, only those whose realm has reached the Jindan stage or the YuanYing stage are eligible to enroll.
道友有什么想了解的？¤What do you want to know, fellow Daoist?

天机轮一共会举行{color=#d0380a}六轮{/color}比试，并且每轮都{color=#d0380a}不会有人被淘汰{/color}，任何修士都可以打满六轮。¤The actual fact is that there are a total of {color=#d0380a}six {/color} rounds of competition, and each round will {color=#d0380a} not be eliminated {/color}, any cultivator can play all six rounds.
还有什么事么？¤Is there anything else?
道友，这些灵石可不够观战。¤Fellow Daoist, these spirit stones are not enough to watch the battle.
需要缴纳十万灵石作为参赛费，道友确定要参赛吗？¤You need to pay 100,000 spirit stones as the entry fee, are you sure you want to participate?
我们会记录每位选手的{color=#d0380a}胜场数{/color}，以及他们战胜过的{color=#d0380a}对手的胜场总数{/color}并记作{color=#d0380a}天机点{/color}，并根据这两个数据编排对战场次，最终的排名也是根据这个得出的。¤We will record each player's {color=#d0380a} number of wins{/color} and the total number of wins{/color} they have defeated their {color=#d0380a} opponents and record them as {color=#d0380a} Tianji points{/color}, and compile the number of battles against each other based on these two figures, and the final ranking is also based on The final ranking is also derived from this.
执事¤Deacon
还有...放我外门的师兄弟们一马吧，那些事儿都是他带着总坛的人做的，外门弟子都不知情，留我玄古门一脉传承。¤And... Let my brothers and sisters from the outer sect off the hook, it was him who did all those things with the people from the main altar, and none of the outer disciples knew about it, leaving my Profound Ancient Sect a lineage to carry on.
他点名要的。说是为了他师傅吧。¤He asked for it by name. Said it was for his master, I think.
轩岚诺，曾经的玄古门首席，掌门弟子，被骗的傻子。现在嘛就是个叛徒。¤Xuan Lan Nuo, once the chief of the Profound Ancient Sect, the disciple of the Sect Master, the fool who was cheated. Now well be a traitor.
那人就在大殿之内，道友还望记得的承诺。¤That person is within the Great Hall, and the Daoist is still expected to remember the promise.
你为什么要跟我说这些？¤Why are you telling me this?
被困在此地精炼麒麟血，从豹麟兽精血中获得麒麟血，但护法在此法上推陈出新进一步精炼可让品阶再上一层。¤Trapped in this place to refine the blood of the qilin, from the essence of the leopard beast to obtain the blood of the Qilin, but the Guardians have pushed on this method further, and is capable of refining the grade to a higher level.
别着急拒绝，你们离火门既然来到此地，必然是冲着他来的，那我们目前不冲突。¤Don't be in a hurry to refuse, since your Heavenly Fire Gate has come here, it must be for him, so we are not in conflict at the moment.
我们都曾以为那位大护法是为了研发炼妖散的志同道合之辈，也是我玄古门中兴之人，但是看错了。¤We had all thought that the Great Guardian was a like-minded person who was working for the development of the Demon Refining Scatter, and someone who would be a part of the rise of my Profound Ancient Sect, but we were wrong.
以你的修为，你不自己动手？¤With your level of training, you don't do it yourself?
玄古门的高徒，倒是一身古神教的神通，道友也算是博学。¤The senior disciple of the Profound Ancient Sect is, on the contrary, covered in the divine powers of the Ancient God Sect, and the Daoist is considered to be knowledgeable.
你想我做什么？¤What do you want me to do?
阵法运转，空间一阵波动此人和阵中的精血都不见了。¤The formation worked and there was a fluctuation in space the man and the essence of blood in the formation were gone.
何必逞口舌之利？我时间不多了，你想问就问吧。¤Why try to be a mouthful? I'm running out of time, so ask all the questions you want.
被骗？\n¤Cheated? \n
杀了他...救出我的师傅。¤Kill him... Save my master.
在下有事相托。¤I have a favour to ask of you.
他们都在玄古殿。¤They are all in the Profound Ancient Hall.
不敌于你，对方反倒舒了一口气。¤The other side breathes a sigh of relief at not being able to defeat you.
你若是答应放我师兄弟一马，这麒麟血我便双手奉上。¤If you promise to let my master and brother go, I will give you this Qilin blood with both hands.
你若是不允，那人就要得偿所愿了。¤If you do not allow it, the man will get what he wants.
深种魔神蛊，我就是个提线木偶。¤Deeply planted with the Demon God compulsion, I am a puppet on a string.
我为什么要帮你？¤Why should I help you?
之前和师傅醉心于炼妖散的研究，希望帮助师傅获得那蜕凡化神的一线生机，也中了此人暗算。¤Before, he and his master were obsessed with the study of demon refining pills, hoping to help his master to obtain the silver lining of Deity Transformation, but they were also hit by this person's secret plan.
咳咳，呼~终于要结束了么。¤Ahem, phew~ Is it finally coming to an end.
提炼麒麟血是为了什么？¤What is the purpose of extracting unicorn blood?
师傅错了，我们都错了。¤The Master was wrong, we were all wrong.
焦师兄上一届宗门大比就打进了前四，要不是遇上了大师兄，肯定也能进前二的。我看他这一次一定对夺魁势在必得啊！¤Senior Brother Jiao scored in the top four in the previous Sect Competition. If he hadn't met the big brother, he would definitely be in the top two. I think he must win the championship this time!
索性这次大比已经拿到了筑基丹，也算有所收获。¤At least I have already recieved a Foundation Pill this grand tournament, that is a gain after all.
{FirstName}{shidi}实力也不容小觑啊，我看他也很有机会夺魁。¤The strength of {FirstName}{shidi} should not be underestimated. I think he also has a good chance of winning the first prize.
刚刚比试的结果都已经出来了，那么第四轮比试，就由{FirstName}{LastName}对阵焦飞。¤The results of the competition just now have come out, so in the fourth round of the competition, {FirstName}{LastName} will play against Jiao Fei.
嗯，这个叫焦飞的年轻人气息内敛，步调平稳，看来修为已经达到炼气后期的巅峰了，不好对付哟。¤Well, this young man named Jiao Fei has a restrained aura and a steady pace. It seems that his cultivation has reached the peak of the late stage of Qi refining, and it is difficult to deal with.
那便有劳总管了…¤Then I'll leave you to it...
若按照五十人来算，大比一共会举行{color=#d0380a}六轮{/color}比试，并且始终都{color=#d0380a}不会有人被淘汰{/color}，每位修士都可以打满六轮。¤If you count fifty people, a total of {color=#d0380a}six rounds{/color} of competition will be held, and always {color=#d0380a}no one will be eliminated{/color}, and each cultivator will be able to play all six rounds.
“竟然还有这一层考虑在内…看来天机阁这边也是下足了功夫。”¤There is actually this layer of consideration included...it seems that the Heavens Secrets Pavilion side has also put in a lot of effort.
推开门，一间不算太大、但各项装饰皆精致异常的迎宾室便映入眼帘。¤Pushing open the door, a not too big, but all the decorations are exquisite and unusual welcome room came into view.
那我定然是不服。他要是吃一颗丹药，我就吃两颗，他要是吃十颗，我就吃二十颗，看谁拼的过谁。¤Then I am definitely not convinced. If he eats one pill, I will eat two, if he eats ten, I will eat twenty, to see who fights over who.
你要是觉得太过复杂，只需要知道选手赢的场次越多、赢的对手越强，你的名次便越靠前就好，其他的交给我们天机阁便是。¤If you think it's too complicated, just know that the more games the player wins, the stronger the opponent wins, the more forward your ranking will be, and the rest is left to us at the Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
另外，排名前十位的选手，将会被记录在{color=#d0380a}天机榜{/color}上，被往来之人所仰望。¤In addition, the top ten ranked players will be recorded on the {color=#d0380a}Tianji Ranking{/color} and looked up to by those who travel to and from.
一来，一般散修面对手持纯阳法宝的富家弟子时，就算二人本身实力相近，也根本毫无招架之力。¤For one thing, when an average independent cultivator encounters a disciple from a rich family with a pure Yang magic treasure, even if the two themselves are similar in strength, one simply stands no chance.
你虽有些不好意思，但奈何盛情难却。¤You are a little embarrassed, but it is difficult to refuse the generosity.
原来是{FirstName}道友，欢迎！¤So it's {FirstName} daoist, welcome!
在下便是天机阁总管，二位想必是第一次来参加大比，可有什么想了解的？¤I am the chief administrator of the Heavenly Pavilion, the two of you must be the first time to participate in the Grand Tournament, can there be anything you want to know?
你们穿过长廊，走到一扇精致的门前，挂牌上写着“贵宾室”三个字。¤You walk through the corridor and come to an exquisite door with the words 'VIP Room' written on the sign.
也就是说{color=#d0380a}赢的场次越多，遇到的对手也就越强{/color}，反之{color=#d0380a}输的场次越多，遇到的对手也就越弱{/color}。¤This means that {color=#d0380a} the more games you win, the stronger the opponent you meet{/color}, and conversely {color=#d0380a} the more games you lose, the weaker the opponent you meet{/color}.
天机榜便是天机大比会场前的那面石壁，道友一看便知。¤The Heavenly Opportunity List is the stone wall in front of the Heavenly Opportunity Competition venue, so you can see it at a glance.
没事，这笔灵石记在我们家名下就好了，咱们就只管观战吧！（反正也是我爹的灵石）¤It's okay, this spirit stone is just credited to our family name, let's just watch the battle! (It's my father's stone anyway)
会场中央的太极图案上均匀地摆放了六座擂台，呈正六边形。其中央的主台则是天机阁主持所用。¤Six rings are evenly placed on the Tai Chi pattern in the center of the venue, in a positive hexagonal shape. The main stage in its center is used by the presiding officer of the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion.
不碍事，看我的！¤It's not a problem, look at me!
呵呵，规矩始终还是规矩，阁下还是先筹到十万灵石为好。¤The rules are still the same, you'd better raise 100,000 spirit stones first.
不错，若是能在观战途中参悟个一星半点，这等机缘可不是想买就能买得到的。¤The actual fact is that if you are able to understand a star and a half on the way to watch the battle, this kind of chance is not something you can buy.
我观摩一二便好。¤I'll just observe a couple of things.
比赛就在明日举行，你们且歇息一晚，准备准备吧。¤The competition will be held tomorrow, you can rest for one night and prepare for it.
天机轮？那是什么赛制？¤The Heavenly Machine Wheel? What kind of tournament system is that?
无妨，道友若打定了主意，到接引处报名即可。¤No matter, if you have made up your mind, you can sign up at the reception.
说罢，他便走到前面，开始为你们带路。¤When he said that, he went ahead and began to lead the way for you.
并且金丹胜元婴历来也是大会的最大看点之一。¤And the Jindan victory over the YuanYing has traditionally been one of the biggest attractions of the conference.
大赛之初本没有这项规定。但后来发生了两种情况，都是我们想极力避免的。¤There was no such rule at the beginning of the tournament. But then two things happened, both of which we wanted to avoid desperately.
若有幸能参悟到此境的玄妙之处，对突破化神而言可是大有裨益。¤If you are fortunate enough to be able to comprehend the subtleties of this realm, it is a great benefit for breaking through to the Deity Transformation.
我爹之前还在大院里弄了个剑形灵模想撑撑场面，后来发现太耗灵石，不如放几把真的剑在那，就换下来了。¤My father also got a sword-shaped spirit mold in the compound before to support the scene, then found too consuming spirit stones, rather than put a few real swords in there, it was replaced.
在下想先考虑一二，再作决断。¤I would like to think about it for a moment or two before I make a decision.
总管接过倪旭欣递来的黑色天机令，用神识留下印记后便还了回去。¤The chief steward took the black Heaven's Opportunity Order handed to him by Ni XuXin, and returned it after leaving an imprint with his soul sense.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，来都来了，不如一同观战吧，看不出门道也要看个热闹不是？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, come are here, why not watch the battle together, see not the doorway also want to see a lively is not?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你既然已经金丹期了，不如报名参赛玩玩！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, since you're already at the Golden Dan stage, why don't you sign up for the competition and have some fun!
不错。此等大会可是实打实的百年一遇，若不好好观摩学习一番，岂不是抱憾而归？¤Not bad. This conference is a real once-in-a-century event, if we do not properly observe and learn something, would not be a regret to return?
道友既然已经了解的差不多了，可有何打算？¤Now that you have almost understood it, what are your plans?
一位看起来十分沉稳的中年修士微笑着向你们走来。¤A middle-aged cultivator who looks very calm and steady smiles as he walks towards you.
我虽有此意，但是这观战费着实有点贵……¤Although I have this intention, but this observation fee is really a bit expensive ......
这……竟然是灵模？天机阁当真是财大气粗啊。¤This ...... is actually a spirit mold? Heavens Secrets Pavilion is really rich and generous ah.
擂台外密密麻麻地布满了黑、白色的小点，并且不断地有白点变成黑点，看样子是在选定座次。¤Outside the ring was densely covered with black and white dots, and there were constantly white dots turning into black dots, looking like they were choosing their seats.
除此之外，若是能夺得大比前十，六品材料，六品秘籍，六品药方等有价无市的绝世珍宝都不在话下。¤In addition, if you can win the top ten of the competition, the sixth grade materials, the sixth grade secret book, the sixth grade prescriptions and other priceless treasures are not under discussion.
他拿着天机令对着一旁的天机阁执事只是晃了一晃，那人便毕恭毕敬地走了过来。¤He took the heavenly opportunity order to the side of the heavenly opportunity pavilion deacon just waved, the man came over respectfully.
若没有排进前十，前二十名也会有一些灵石奖励，至少算是能挣回报名费了。¤If you don't make it to the top ten, the top twenty will be rewarded with some spirit stones, so you can at least earn back your entry fee.
好说，好说。二位想必是第一次来参加大比，可有什么想了解的？¤Good point, good point. You two must be here for the first time to participate in the Grand Tournament, is there anything you want to know?
更有甚者，一场比赛中双方水平相差无几，僵持不下后，竟变成了丹药的消耗战。还好比赛最后被阁主强行中断，否则以他们服下的丹药量，非得双双毒发身亡不可。¤What's more, a match in which the level of both sides are very different, after a stalemate, it actually turned into a war of attrition of pills. Fortunately, the competition was finally interrupted by the court master, otherwise, with the amount of pills they took, they would have to both die of poison.
好，那便谢过总管了。¤Good, then thank you Chief Steward.
不错，当初由于服用丹药一事，便有许多修士不服气，找上门来理论。¤Yes, at the beginning, because of the matter of taking pills, there were many cultivators who were not convinced and came to the door for theories.
太虚境乃是一处由天机阁掌管的秘境。¤Great Void Dimension is a secret realm controlled by the Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
哈哈哈哈哈，真当是自古英雄出少年，这里便预祝道友能在大赛上取得一个好名次了！¤Hahahahahahaha, it's true that heroes come out of the old days, so I wish you a good ranking in the competition!
内务执事¤Internal Affairs Deacon
自然是为了能展现出选手的真正实力。¤Naturally, it is to be able to show the true strength of the players.
首先，夺得魁首之人，将得到一次参悟太虚境的机会。¤First of all, the person who wins the top prize will get a chance to enlighten the realm of Taixu.
你们随他穿过大厅长廊，走到一扇精致的门前，挂牌上写着“贵宾室”三个字。¤You followed him through the hall corridor and came to an exquisite door with the words 'VIP room' written on the sign.
我虽有此意，但是这报名费着实有点贵……¤Although I have this intention, but this registration fee is really a bit expensive ......
那便预祝阁下取得一个好的名次了。¤Then I wish you a good ranking.
原来是倪家的朋友，欢迎！¤So you are a friend of the Ni family, welcome!
之后经内阁讨论，又修订了数次，才有了如今的规矩。¤After that, it was discussed by the cabinet and revised several times before the rules came into being today.
为保证比赛的公平，所有参赛者在比赛期间都{color=#d0380a}禁用任何武器、防具、法宝与丹药{/color}。¤To ensure fairness in the competition, all participants are {color=#d0380a} prohibited from using any weapons, defensive gear, magic treasures and Pills {/color} during the competition.
在下便是天机阁总管，不知二位有何贵干？¤I am the Chief Steward of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion, I wonder what you two want?
那又该如何保证每轮都遇到与自己实力相近的对手？¤Then how should I ensure that I meet an opponent of similar strength to myself in every round?
比试于明日开始，道友且去休息室调整状态罢。¤The competition starts tomorrow, and you go to the lounge to adjust your state.
道友届时只需前来观战即可，其余的交给我们天机阁便好。¤Daoist then only need to come to watch the battle, the rest to our Heavens Secrets Pavilion will be fine.
我们会记录每位选手的{color=#d0380a}胜场数{/color}，以及他们战胜过的{color=#d0380a}对手的胜场总数{/color}并记为{color=#d0380a}天机点{/color}，并根据这些编排对战场次，以及决定最终排名。¤We record each player's {color=#d0380a} number of wins{/color}, as well as the total number of {color=#d0380a} opponents they have defeated{/color} and record them as {color=#d0380a} Tianji points{/color}, and based on these compile the number of battles against each other, as well as decide the final ranking.
只有这样，金丹修士前来参赛时才会掂量掂量自己的实力，毕竟十万灵石也不是一个小数目，有自信挣回本的，自然是金丹期的佼佼者。¤Only then, the jindan cultivator to come to the competition will weigh their own strength, after all, 100,000 spirit stones is not a small amount, have the confidence to earn back the capital, naturally the best of the jindan period.
灵模是一种特殊的法宝，可以将灵气凝聚起来，模仿成别的东西。¤The spirit mold is a special magic treasure that can condense the spirit energy and imitate it into something else.
二来，若对手明显弱于道友，却能通过服用丹药取胜，想来道友一定不会服气吧。¤Secondly, if the opponent is obviously weaker than the daoist, but can win by taking pills, I think the daoist must not be convinced, right?
届时，阁下只需于接引阁报名参赛便好。¤At that time, your Excellency only need to register in the receiving pavilion to participate will be good.
传言天机阁老祖在机缘巧合之下参悟此境之后，只道“如神游太虚，妙不可言”，故得名“太虚境”。¤Rumor has it that after the old ancestor of the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion had enlightened this realm by chance, he only said, 'Like a god traveling in the Tai Void, it's inexpressible', so it got the name 'Tai Void Realm'.
没事，这笔灵石记在我们家名下就好了，你就只管上吧！（反正也是我爹的灵石）¤It's okay, the stone is credited to our family name, you just go on! (Anyway, it's my father's spirit stone)
呵呵，道友若是想试试身手，我们自然欢迎。¤Oh, if you want to try your hand, we naturally welcome.
那便有劳总管了。¤Then I'll be grateful to the chief administrator.
二位既然已经了解的差不多了，可有何打算？¤Since you two have almost understood, what are your plans?
天机榜？¤Tianji list?
两位贵宾，这边请。¤This way please, two distinguished guests.
确实巧妙，只是照这架势，一时半会恐怕还轮不到我们。¤Indeed ingenious, just according to the momentum, a moment I'm afraid it's not our turn.
道友想必是第一次来参加大比，可有什么想了解的？¤Daoist must be the first time to attend the big competition, can there be anything you want to know?
你可别告诉别人，这天机令其实是我偷拿我爸的。当初便想着来天机阁说不定能派上用场，就带上了，没想到真的有用。¤You can not tell others, this heavenly machine order is actually I stole my father's. At the beginning then thought to come to the Heavenly Machine Pavilion might come in handy, so I brought it with me, I did not expect it to really work.
既然来此，自然是要与各路高手比试比试。¤Since we are here, we naturally want to compete with experts from all walks of life.
只可惜古往今来，能参悟此境者已是十不足一，此后突破化神之人更是寥寥无几，所以具体能有多少收获，全看个人造化了。¤It is a pity that less than one in ten people have been able to understand this realm throughout the ages, and only a few have broken through the Deity Transformation since then, so it depends on one's own destiny how much one can gain.
公平起见，比赛将采用天机阁独创的赛制——{color=#d0380a}天机轮{/color}。¤To be fair, the competition will use the Heavens Secrets Pavilion's original tournament system - {color=#d0380a}Tianji Wheel{/color}.
若门槛太低，都是些烂芋充数的货色，想必也吸引不了这么多人前来观战吧。¤If the threshold is too low, are some rotten taro filled goods, I think it will not attract so many people to come to watch the battle.
整个会场被规划地层次分明，极具美感。¤The entire venue is planned to be layered and very aesthetically pleasing.
二来，若你的对手明显弱于你，却能通过服用丹药取胜，你当如何应对？¤Second, if your opponent is obviously weaker than you, but can win by taking pills, how do you respond?
灵模？¤Spiritual model?
参赛费虽贵，却是大赛质量的保障。¤Although the entry fee is expensive, it is the guarantee of the quality of the competition.
会场上空漂浮着几座小山，其上零星地散布着一些红色小点，想来是给金丹、元婴期前辈所预留的位置。¤There are several small mountains floating above the venue, with some red dots scattered sporadically on them, which are thought to be reserved for the Jindan and YuanYing stage seniors.
不过这灵模用在安排座次上倒的确很合适，也不知道是什么人想出来的。¤But this spirit mold used in the arrangement of seating is indeed very appropriate, and I do not know what kind of people came up with.
途中，倪旭欣悄悄凑到了你的耳边。¤On the way, Ni XuXin quietly came up to your ear.
不错，道友若能在大比上习得个一招半式，也算是不虚此行了。¤Yes, if you can learn a trick and a half in the competition, it is not a vain trip.
这门槛嘛…自然是有。¤This threshold well...naturally there is.
太虚境？¤Great Void Dimension?
也……没什么重要的事…额…我们只是想来看看比赛来着…¤Also ...... nothing important...er...we just wanted to come and see the competition...
接引阁大厅内，一座由灵气凝聚而成、青色半透明的微型“会场”赫然悬浮在大殿中央，四周围满了炼气、筑基修士。¤In the hall of the reception pavilion, a miniature 'meeting place' made of aura condensation, green and translucent is suspended in the center of the hall, surrounded by qi refining, foundation building cultivators.
好说，我阁为境界到达金丹期以上的修士留有特等席位，也算是感谢道友的捧场了。¤Good to say, my pavilion for the realm to reach the Golden Dan stage and above the cultivators have reserved special seats, also be considered to thank the Daoist friends of the show.
只见倪旭欣咧嘴一笑，从储物袋中掏出了一枚黑色的天机令。¤Only to see Ni XuXin grin and pull out a black heavenly opportunity order from his storage bag.
道友，这边便是接引阁，在此办理大比相关事宜便可。在下还有公务在身，便先行告退了。¤Fellow Daoist, this is the reception pavilion, so you can handle matters related to the Grand Tournament here. I have business to attend to, so I'll leave first.
原来是{FirstName}道友与倪家的少主，欢迎！¤So it's you {FirstName} and the young master of the Ni family, welcome!
大总管¤Chief Steward
一位看起来十分沉稳的中年修士微笑着向你走来。¤A middle-aged cultivator who looks very calm and steady smiles as he approaches you.
当初由于服用丹药一事，便有许多修士不服气，找上门来理论。¤In the beginning, because of the matter of taking pills, there were many cultivators who were not convinced and came to the door for theories.
为了保证大赛的吸引力，天机阁自然会把最好的东西拿出来。¤In order to ensure the attractiveness of the competition, the Heavens Secrets Pavilion will naturally bring out the best things.
你好不容易战胜了这些剑灵，但那名离火门的弟子却已身死道消。¤You finally defeated these sword spirits, but the Heavenly Fire Gate disciple was dead.
这位道友，对不住啦。反正这些东西生不带来死不带去的，与其让它们一直留在这破遗迹里，还不如留给我算了。¤This fellow Taoist, I'm sorry. Anyway, these things will not bring death or not, instead of letting them stay in this ruined ruin, it's better to leave it to me.
炎萧{$ChenHu},我要回武陵城白帝楼报告天魔眼的情况，不知你...¤Yan Xiao {$ChenHu},I have to go back to the White Emperor Building in Wuling City to report on the situation of the Heavenly Demon Eye, I don't know what you...
一边说着，你与炎萧传送出了天魔眼的阵法空间，回到宁州大陆。¤While talking, you and Yan Xiao teleported out of the formation space of the Heavenly Demon Eye and returned to the Ning Province continent.
好像是武陵城方向！我们快过去！¤It seems to be the direction of Wuling City! Let's go there!
更何况还有古神教也在觊觎...当年试图渗透我离火门，还蛊惑墨师弟。此仇我炎萧绝不会忘！¤Not to mention that there is also the Ancient God Cult is also coveting ... Back then, they tried to infiltrate my Heavenly Fire Gate, and also compelled Brother Mo. This revenge I Yan Xiao will never forget!
也是。¤Also yes.
而后便是沉默。¤And then there was silence.
嗯，但天魔眼本身对魔道修士的吸引力也不小，只怕他们依旧不会放弃祸害宁州。¤Well, but the Heavenly Demon Eye itself is not a small attraction to the evil cultivators, and I'm afraid they still won't give up the scourge of Ning Province.
但这片熟悉的大陆，如今在你眼里是如此的陌生。¤But this familiar continent is now so unfamiliar in your eyes.
我与你顺路，不如一同前往吧。¤I'm on the same road as you, why don't we go together?
魔门...¤Devil's Gate...
这天魔既然被我们解决，对于天魔道来说，应当是个不小的打击。¤Since this heavenly demon was solved by us, it should be a big blow for the Heavenly Demon Dao.
这...这是怎么回事！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤This... What's going on! {vpunch=10,0.5}
炎萧{$YXChenHao}...¤Yan Xiao {$YXChenHao}...
不是，一切都没变，只是这狂暴的灵气，以及令人心悸的战斗波动，绝不是宁州寻常能见到的！¤No, everything has not changed, only this rampant aura, and the palpitating battle fluctuations, is never the Ning Province unusual can see!
算了算了，我还是先去其他地方找所需的炼器材料吧，这种事生气也没用。¤Forget it, I'll go to other places to find the required refining materials first, it's useless to be angry with this kind of thing.
啊抱歉，一时兴奋差点怠慢了{FirstName}{$NickName}。¤Ah sorry, I almost snubbed {FirstName}{$NickName} in a moment of excitement.
你拿出储物袋里的3份{$CaiLiaoName}，毫不犹豫地交给了{$NpcName}。¤You take out 3 copies of {$CaiLiaoName} from your storage bag and hand them over to {$NpcName} without hesitation.
多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}，若不是有你帮忙我还不知道该怎么办才好。¤Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName}, I don't know what I would have done without your help.
那我得抓紧去其他地方寻找炼器材料了，就先告辞了。¤Then I have to go to other places to look for refining materials, so I will say goodbye.
你面有难色的看向他，后者脸色也是一变。¤You looked at him with an embarrassed expression, and the latter's expression also changed.
竟被人捷足先登了...别让我找到是谁夺我仙缘，不然，哼！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤I was actually taken first... Don't let me find out who took my immortal fate, otherwise, hum! {vpunch=10,0.5}
那我就不推辞了。¤Then I will not refuse.
我赶到那妖兽洞穴时，已经不见{$CaiLiaoName}踪影，抱歉。¤When I arrived at the monster cave, {$CaiLiaoName} was nowhere to be seen, sorry.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，可有找到{$CaiLiaoName}？¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, can you find {$CaiLiaoName}?
我只需要两份，还有一份{FirstName}{$NickName}自己留着吧。¤I only need two, and {FirstName}{$NickName} will keep it for myself.
你回到客栈，{$NpcName}果然正在此处焦急地等你的消息，全无平时稳重的样子。¤When you return to the inn, {$NpcName} is waiting here anxiously for your news, not as calm as usual.
他向你点点头，而后离开了客栈。¤He nodded to you and left the inn.
{Xiao}，给我等着。¤{Xiao}, wait for me.
{Xiao}，最重要的材料找到了，等我炼完法宝非得揍他一顿不可。¤{Xiao}, the most important material has been found. After I finish practicing the magic weapon, I have to beat him up.
你当然不会说出拿到的{$CaiLiaoName}已经被你另作他用的事实。¤Of course you won't tell the fact that the {$CaiLiaoName} you got has already been used by you.
直到感知到你的气息，他才勉强装出一副云淡风轻的样子。¤It wasn't until he sensed your breath that he barely pretended to be calm.
多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}，这是说好的报酬，尽管拿去吧。¤Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName}, this is the promised reward, go ahead and take it.
说罢，他已是阴沉着脸缓步离去。¤After all, he walked away slowly with a gloomy face.
你回到客栈，{$NpcName}果然还在此处焦急地等你的消息。¤When you return to the inn, {$NpcName} is still waiting anxiously for your news.
不等你回应，{NpcName}就已满脸兴奋地离开了客栈。¤Before you could respond, {NpcName} left the inn excitedly.
不等你再说什么，{$NpcName}已然是愤然离开客栈，不知去往何处了。¤Before you can say anything else, {$NpcName} has left the inn angrily and doesn't know where to go.
感受到你的出现后，他面带微笑地迎了上来。¤After feeling your presence, he greeted him with a smile.
后者也是喜形于色，但旋即转为微笑并看向你。¤The latter is also beaming, but then turns to smile and look at you.
这是说好的报酬，{FirstName}{$NickName}请收下。¤This is the promised reward, please accept {FirstName}{$NickName}.
太好了，所差的材料不多了。¤Great, not much material left.
再见。¤goodbye.
唉，此事常有发生，只怪我与它无缘吧，{FirstName}{$NickName}无须自责。¤Alas, this happens all the time, just blame me for missing it, {FirstName}{$NickName} doesn't have to blame herself.
没能拿到么...¤Can't get it...
待你回应后，{NpcName}迅速离开客栈，不知往何处寻觅炼器材料去了。¤After you responded, {NpcName} quickly left the inn and went somewhere to find the refining materials.
我还得去其他地方寻找炼器材料，就不多叨扰道友了，告辞！¤I still have to go to other places to find the materials for the refining, so I won't bother my fellow Daoists, farewell!
你回到客栈，{$NpcName}果然还在此处等你的消息，与之前没有太多的差别。¤When you return to the inn, {$NpcName} is still waiting for your news, not too different from before.
这边只差....¤It's just a matter of....
唉，只怪我与它无缘吧。¤Alas, just blame me for missing it.
抱歉。¤Feel sorry.
后者也是喜形于色并毫不掩饰地用眼神向你表示感谢。¤The latter is also happy and unabashedly thank you with his eyes.
我还要去寻找其他的炼器材料，就先告辞了。¤I have to look for other refining materials, so I will say goodbye.
这是说好的报酬，{FirstName}{$NickName}不用跟{$ZaiXia}客气。¤This is the promised reward, {FirstName}{$NickName} doesn't have to be polite to {$ZaiXia}.
那我便先告辞了。¤Then I will say goodbye.
感受到你的出现后，他急不可耐地迎了上来。¤After feeling your presence, he impatiently greeted him.
嘿嘿，这附近不太平啊。¤Hey, it's not peaceful around here.
浅海域经常能遇到蓬莎巨蟹，想来若是捉几只金丹修为的巨蟹烹成灵肴必定鲜美可口...¤Pongsha crabs can often be encountered in shallow waters. If you want to catch a few Jindan cultivation crabs and cook them into spiritual dishes, they will be delicious...
请问道友，在下此次猎魔比试排名如何？¤My fellow Taoists, how will you rank in the next demon hunting competition?
道友名列前茅，可喜可贺。¤Friends of Taoism are among the best, it is gratifying and congratulating.
道友，我派正在收集灵核用以布阵，你若是有多余的灵核，可以在我这里换取其它的材料或是丹药。{w}{w=0.5}¤Friends of Taoism, I am sending to collect spiritual cores for formation. If you have extra spiritual cores, you can exchange for other materials or medicines from me. {w}{w=0.5}
道友成绩中规中矩，有待提高。¤The Daoist's performance is quite satisfactory and needs to be improved.
道友并未上榜，望下届努力。¤Friends of Taoism are not on the list, I hope to work hard in the next session.

我看到了，前面不远处就有一处裂隙！¤I see, there is a rift not far in front!
这古迹所处的空间极不稳定，和宁州大为不同，我想我们应该能找到不少能够进入那里的裂隙。¤The space around this monument is very unstable, we should be able to find some spatial rifts to enter through nearby!
哈哈哈，这才不是真正的空间乱流，若是两个真正的大位面所产生的乱流，一瞬间就可以把你撕成碎片。¤Haha, this isn't real spatial turbulence! If this were generated by two larger planes you'd be ripped to shreds!
多加小心，就算看起来不远，但附近乱流纵横，未必真能找到一条可以安全抵达那里的通道。¤Be careful, even if it doesn't seem far away, but there is turbulent flow nearby, you may not really find a way to get there safely.
没想到位面之间的灵气乱流果真如此恐怖，即便以我如今的修为也难以抵挡。¤Unexpectedly, the spatial turbulence between the planes is really terrifying, even with my current cultivation, it's difficult to resist.
这宁州古迹说到底也是原来位面的一部分，只是坍缩到了一处小空间之中。现在你感受到的这些，恐怕连真实乱流威力的万分之一都不到。¤In analysis, this ancient monument's space was originally a part of Ning Province. The space here must have collapsed! The turbulence you feel now is only one ten thousandth of the turbulence you'd feel if this happened in Ning Province!
你刚一进入空间裂隙，便被一股强大的灵气乱流裹挟着飞出很远的距离。你连忙运转灵气抵御乱流，这才得以稳住身形，抽空观察四周。¤As soon as you entered the space rift, you were engulfed by a powerful turbulence of aura and flew a long distance away. You quickly ran your aura to resist the turbulence, so that you could stabilize your figure and take time to observe your surroundings.
要是能去一次宁州古迹就好了，听说有人在那里找到过几万年前就失传的功法神通。¤It would be great if I could go to the ancient monument in Ning Province once. I heard that someone found a secret technique that was lost thousands of years ago.
想不到那人竟如此难缠，这下真不知怎么面对师父……¤I didn't expect that person to be so difficult to deal with, I really don't know how to face Master now...
一番较量过后，那人很快便败下阵来。¤After trying to put up a fight, the man was quickly defeated...
这下也算是帮师父处理了一些琐事。¤This can be regarded as helping the master to deal with some trivial matters.
一番较量过后，你并不是那人对手。¤After fighting for a little bit, it's clear you aren't this persons opponent!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}小心！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} be careful!
喂，金丹期的帮手岂是你我能应付得了的！¤Hey, how can you and I be expected to take down this person in the Golden Core realm!?
......倪兄？¤...Brother Ni?
我好不容易打伤了他，结果这厮居然找来个金丹帮手抓我！¤I finally wounded him, but he actually got someone in the Golden Core realm to attack me!
这次又是什么事？¤What's the matter this time?
每次在我遇难时刻总有{xiongdi}出现，你我简直是天赐良缘！¤Every time I am in danger, {xiongdi} always appears. You are simply a blessing!
只见倪旭欣祭出飞剑便反身攻了上去，你见他已经拖住了那名金丹修士，连忙头也不回地遁走了。¤You saw that Ni XuXin sacrificed his flying sword to deflect the attack and led the Golden Core cultivator away!
哼，{xiaozi}哪里逃！¤Huh, where can {xiaozi} escape to?!
别提了，我路见不平，惹了一群截道散修，结果其中一人居然有筑基巅峰修为。¤Don't mention it, I saw a bunch of independent cultivators being unjust and intervened, it turned out one of them was at the peak of Foundation Establishment!
可惜天不遂人意，你们还没跑出多远便被强大的神识笼罩。¤It's a pity that your luck is unsatisfactory. You haven't run far before you are enveloped by a powerful soul sense!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}留步！！！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} stay here!!!
快快快！快跑！一会儿他又追上来了！¤Quick, quick! Run! He will catch up again in a while!
你莫名其妙被卷进了这场追杀，但也只能忙不迭得跟着倪旭欣一起往武陵城的方向逃遁。¤You were involved in this chase inexplicably, but you can only rush to escape with Ni XuXin in the direction of Wuling City.
倪兄小心！¤Brother Ni, be careful!
哼，我可是金丹后期修士，离进阶元婴也只差一筹，林家那筑基丫头居然还不乐意。¤I'm a late Golden Core cultivator and I'm only one step away from advancing to the nascent soul stage, yet that Foundation stage Lin girl isn't satisfied.
来找我何事?¤Why did you come to me?
客人要有做客的样子，整天在府里瞎晃悠像什么话？¤Guests should behave like a guest, isn't it improper to wander around the host's house all day?
哪来的小辈，去，去，别在这碍眼。¤Where did you juniors come from? Go, go! Don't be an eyesore here.
栖云本就负责我们林府与星宫之间的商业往来，这次沐心闯了祸，让星宫的冲虚长老丢了脸面。¤Qi Yun was originally responsible for the business dealings between our Lin Mansion and Star Palace. This time Muxin made a mess and embarassed elder Chongxu of Star Palace!
只要我早日突破元婴，嘿嘿嘿¤As long as I break through to the Nascent Soul stage soon... Hehehe...
我们林府和星宫的联姻本就是千年以来的传统，事关重大，由不得沐心这个毛还没有长齐的丫头自己做主。¤Our marriage between Lin Mansion and Star Palace is a tradition for thousands of years and is of great importance! It is impossible for Muxin, a girl who is still wet behind the ears to make the decision!
是你？¤It's you?
这百年来我们两家之间的联姻大多是老夫一手操办的，还从来没有出过如此纰漏。真是无法无天，无法无天！¤In the past hundred years, most of the marriages between our two families have been handled by the elders alone, there has never been such a mistake. It is lawless, lawless!
难为栖云为了此事还要亲自去星宫登门道歉，老夫也是问心有愧啊。¤It's hard for Qiyun to go to the Star Palace to apologize for this. The old man also has a guilty conscience.
没想到这个年代，还有人修习这等邪法，不过这丹药本身倒真的是温养神魂的大补之物。¤Unexpectedly, in this era, there are still people practicing these evil methods... But this pill itself is really a great tonic for nourishing the soul.
道友，若是想要神识精进，不妨试试我这“厉魄丹”。¤Friend, if you want to improve your Soul Sense, you might want to try my Soul Orb Pill.
这丹药.....¤This pill...
确实，古神教对咱们可是“颇为关心”呢。¤Indeed, the Ancient Gods are ''very concerned'' about us.
这可不是简单的灵虫，是古神教大名鼎鼎的魔神蛊。¤This is not a simple spirit worm, it is the Ancient God Sect's famous Demon God Compulsion.
师傅...¤Master...
他上次伏击我都是十万年前的事儿了。哈哈哈，活得久才是硬道理。¤It's been 100,000 years since he last ambushed me. Hahahaha, living long is the hard way.
没错，你们再看？¤That's right, you guys look again?
哎呦，很会说话嘛。¤Aigoo, very good at talking.
恶饕这老王八蛋死都死了，他这帮徒子徒孙居然还惦记着我这个老人家。¤The old son of a bitch is dead, but his disciples are still thinking of me as an old man.
也不能断定，这玄古丹我也是收集过。此前我并无发现什么。¤Nor can I conclude that I have collected this Profound Ancient Dan. I did not find anything before that.
身为离火门弟子，理应为宗门分忧。¤As a disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate, it is only right that he should share the worries of the sect.
自我出门到现在，咱们离火门可都不太平呢。¤Since I left home, there has been no peace at the Heavenly Fire Gate.
言毕，眼前的少年少有的露出凝重之色。¤After speaking, the teenager in front of him showed a rare look of Gravity.
天星城么，我这就前去一趟，看看这玄古门葫芦里卖的是什么药。¤I'm going to go there and see what medicine this Profound Ancient Sect is selling.
说罢，少年的掌中出现了一个黑色的小瓶，一团火焰凭空出现熔化了瓶子，一枚丹药出现在你们眼前。¤After saying this, a black vial appeared in the teenager's palm, a flame appeared out of thin air and melted the vial, a pill appeared before your eyes.
嗯，这是我在外面游历的时候，一个古神教小杂鱼身上得到的，不能直接说明什么。¤Well, I got it from a small mongrel of the Ancient God Cult when I was out on a trip, and it doesn't tell me anything directly.
抬眼看去，眼前的并非之前的圣兽而是一名少年，而钟焰则立于其身后。¤When he looked up, it was not the holy beast from before but a young boy in front of him, and Zhong Yan was standing behind him.
（...还来？）¤(... Come again?)
但连他们宗门所在都不知道，师弟你时常在外走动，这天星城一行就劳烦你了。¤But I don't even know where their clan is located. Senior brother, you are always out and about, so I'll bother you with this trip to the Heavenly Star City.
你多学学人家，不要一天到晚顶撞我这个老人家~¤You should learn from others, don't contradict me, an old man, all the time~
唉，这帮愣头青们真不让我老人家省心。此番也是希望你能帮忙多收集一些玄古门的情报。¤These rash youngsters really don't let my old man worry. This time, I also hope that you can help gather more information about the Profound Ancient Sect.
少年掌中火焰一起，浮于掌心的小虫便化作飞灰。¤The young man's palm was ablaze and the tiny insects floating in his palm were reduced to ashes.
是.....¤Yes .....
目前对他们知之甚少，只知道他们会定时前往天星城坊市售卖丹药，再换取要收材料甚至幼崽回宗门。¤Little is known about them at the moment, except that they will regularly travel to the Heavenly Star City market to sell pills, and then exchange them for materials or even pups to be collected back to the clan.
能看到少年对你挑了挑眉，你也知道了这是哪里来的。¤You can see the teenager raise an eyebrow at you and you know where this is coming from.
刚一进门，一阵熟悉的威压笼罩了你。¤As soon as you enter, a familiar intimidating pressure envelops you.
渐渐地火焰中出现一颗黑色小球，毫无灵气波动，即使是钟焰也是面露疑惑。¤Gradually a small black ball appeared in the flames, with no aura fluctuations, and even Zhong Yan was puzzled.
现在有什么调查方向么？¤Are there any directions for investigation now?
火焰继续燃烧，丹药也开始分崩离析，空气中充满了一股腥甜之气。¤The flames continued to burn and the Pill began to fall apart, filling the air with a fishy-sweet smell.
玄古丹竟是一枚虫卵？¤The Profound Ancient Dan is actually a worm egg?
嘿嘿，开开玩笑嘛。¤Hey, hey, just kidding.
我曾详细的查探过，衡州没有传出恶饕老鬼飞升的消息，看来是寿元已尽了。¤I have checked in detail and there is no news of the old evil gourmets ascending in Hengzhou, so it seems that they have reached the end of their life span.
闲话少叙，这一次，我来找你也是有事相托。¤Without further ado, this time, I have come to you with a request.
不过，宗门弟子还是有人服用此物，需要仔细留心。¤However, some of the clan's disciples still take this substance and need to keep a careful eye on it.
玄古丹？¤Profound Ancient Dan?
仔细想来，这玄古门自衡州逃亡而来行事低调安分，再加之和古神教又是敌对关系，我也是对他们疏于防范了。¤I think carefully, this Profound Ancient Sect has been fleeing from Heng Zhou and has been acting in a low-profile and peaceful manner, plus they are in a hostile relationship with the Ancient God Sect, so I have been negligent about them.
既是钟师兄所托，自然要尽快完成。¤Since it is entrusted by Brother Zhong, I naturally have to finish it as soon as possible.
这次闭关阿焰要守着阵法分不开身，多亏了你出去寻找木系灵物供给凤火涅槃阵。¤Thanks to you, you went out to find wood spirits to supply the Phoenix Fire Nirvana Formation.
嘿嘿，看好给你们变个戏法，老人家我也是小小的研究了一下呢。¤Hey, look out for a trick for you guys, old man I've been doing a little research on it.
我这次出门也还是有不少发现的。¤I still found quite a few things on my trip out too.
那门内彻查此事就交给我来。我们兵分两路，看看这衡州来人究竟是有何居心。¤Then I will be the one to investigate the matter thoroughly. We will divide our forces into two and see what the intentions of the people from Hengzhou are.
少年手掐法诀，一道灵印注入其中，竟有一只小虫破壳而出。¤The young man's hand chanted a spell and a spirit seal was injected into it, and a small insect actually broke out of its shell.
金虹剑派...真是名不虚传。¤The Golden Rainbow Sword Sect... really deserves its reputation.
这次出海收获颇多，道友看看我这里有没有你需要的东西？¤This time I went to sea to gain a lot. Fellow Daoists, see if I have something you need?
随便看，随便挑啊。¤Look and choose whatever you want.
听说在采筠阁能买到元婴，甚至化神期海兽的情报。真想看看啊...¤I heard that you can buy information in the Caiyun Pavillion about sea beasts in the Nascent Soul stage, or even the Deity Transformation stage! I really want to see it for myself.
这位道友，来看看有没有什么想要的？¤This fellow Taoist, come and see if you have anything you like?
这谷内坊市真是热闹，竟然全是修仙者。¤This Guneifang City is really lively, and it turns out that there are only immortal cultivators.
是啊，这里百年前便是如此热闹，那年我们……唉，如今也只剩我一人了。凡人的阳寿，太短暂了。¤Yeah, it was so lively here a hundred years ago, that year we... Well, now I am the only one left. The life of a mortal is too short.
我只当这三只是普通的下等魔，才贸然出手，若我早知道它们是异种魔，也不会身处险境了。¤I only thought these three were ordinary, inferior demons before I rushed out. If I had known they were fae demons, I wouldn't have been in danger.
{FirstName}{shidi}好身手。此番我等能活下来，还是多亏了你，这魔物理应归你所有。¤{FirstName}{shidi}Good hands. It is thanks to you that we have survived this time, and this magic physic should be yours.
如此甚好。¤That's good.
他叹了一口气。¤He sighed.
此地不宜久留，我等还是先找一偏僻去处落脚为好。¤It is not a good idea to stay here for long, so we should first find a remote place to settle down.
说着，又拿出了两颗疗伤用的丹药给师妹服下。片刻过后，师妹的脸色好转了不少。¤Saying that, he took out two more pills for healing and gave them to his senior sister. A few moments later, Senior Sister's face looked much better.
既然{$称呼}执意如此，在下便不过多劝说了。不如留下传音符，以便日后联系？¤Since {$address} insists on doing so, I will not persuade you too much. How about leaving a voice transmission talisman for future contact?
此伤虽重，但尚未伤及根本，只需运春草决，数日之内便可痊愈。¤Although this injury is serious, it has not yet damaged the root of the injury.
随后，你们三人便转移到了附近一处较为隐蔽的山洞。能在此处修养，想必不会有什么大碍了。¤The three of you then moved to a more secluded cave nearby. I'm sure it won't be a big deal to be able to recuperate here.
原来是{FirstName}道友，幸会。¤So it's {FirstName} Daoist, nice to meet you.
嗯，助你在杀魔竞赛上取得一个好名次，后会有期。¤Well, help you get a good place at the Demon Killing Competition, see you later.
你观察到，他之前略显慌乱的神色已经消失不见，完全看不出刚刚经历过一场大战。¤You observe that his slightly flustered look from earlier has disappeared and you can't see that he has just been through a big battle at all.
交换过传音符后，你便告别离开了此地。¤After exchanging the summons, you said your goodbyes and left the place.
这天魔眼的险恶远不止魔物这么简单，若是有人暗中对我等有所图谋，就算此地再隐蔽，也会被找到。¤This Heavenly Demon Eye is far more sinister than just demons. If someone secretly has plans for us, even if this place is hidden, we will still be found.
既然如此，那便祝愿二位早日康复，后会有期。¤In that case, I wish you both a speedy recovery and see you later.
道友好身手。此番我等能活下来，还是多亏了道友，这魔物理应归道友所有。¤You are very skillful. It is thanks to you that we have survived this time, and this demon physic should go to you.
我还是在此等师妹痊愈再作打算罢。¤I should wait until my sister has recovered before making any plans.
按理说，同辈之间几乎不可能有人能跟踪你们，而不被察觉。不过既然李青麟的立场如此坚定，你也不便过多劝说。¤It is reasonable to say that it is almost impossible for anyone among your peers to be able to follow you without being noticed. But since Li Qinglin's stance is so firm, you are not in a position to persuade too much.
此处极为隐蔽，师妹伤势也有所控制，就算没有你我二人，也定然不会有事的。¤This place is extremely secluded and my sister's injuries are under control, so even without you and me, I'm sure she'll be fine.
李青麟眉头微皱，稍作思索，却还是没有答应。¤Li Qinglin frowned slightly and thought for a moment, but still did not agree.
再说各宗不是还有猎魔竞赛之事？若杀魔杀的少了，说不定会令整个宗门蒙羞，难道{$称呼}一点都不在乎？¤The actual fact is that there are still demon hunting competitions in each clan. If they kill less demons, it might bring shame to the whole clan, don't {$name} care at all?
在回应你的同时，李青麟检查起了师妹的伤势。¤In response to you, Li Qinglin checked up on his sister's injuries.
以我二人的实力，像之前那些异种魔，定然不是我们的对手。¤With the strength of the two of us, fae demons like those before us are certainly no match for us.
听到异种魔的字眼，李青麟的神情隐隐露出些微异样。¤Hearing the word Fae Devil, Li Qinglin's expression vaguely revealed a slight difference.
幸会，在下{FirstName}{LastName}。¤It is a pleasure to meet you, under {FirstName}{LastName}.
战后，你立马投身进对另外两只异种魔的围剿，没过多久，那只魔物也应声倒下。¤Immediately after the battle, you plunge into the siege of the other two Fae demons, and it is not long before that one falls in response.
既然你师妹已经安顿下来了，我们便继续前往核心区域杀魔罢。¤Now that your sister has settled down, let's continue to the core area to kill demons.
“他如此袒护师妹，难道关系并不一般？也罢，我还是不要多问了。”¤'He is so protective of his senior sister, could it be that the relationship is not ordinary? It's just as well, I'd better not ask more questions.''
好险，看来还是不要轻易招惹异种魔为好。¤That was close. It seems better not to mess with the fae demons so easily.
在下竹山宗李青麟，这位是我的同门师妹，敢问阁下尊姓大名？¤I am Li Qinglin of the Bamboo Mountain Sect, this is my fellow student sister, may I ask your name?
{$称呼}，此地当属天魔眼外围，为何会有如此强大的异种魔出现？难道此地生出了什么变故？¤{Why would such a powerful Fae demon appear in this place, which is at the outer edge of the Heavenly Demon's Eye? Could it be that something has changed here?
至于杀魔竞赛，只是长老们相互打趣的消遣罢了，不值得为之冒险。¤As for the demon-killing competition, it is just a pastime for the elders to have fun with each other and is not worth risking their lives for.
多谢师兄，我好多了。¤Thanks a lot brother, I am much better.
这异样虽然转瞬即逝，不过你却依然有所察觉。¤The difference is fleeting, but you are still aware of it.
（这个{color=red}古神教{/color}才是近来的不明修士吗？）¤(Is this {color=red}Ancient Gods Cult{/color} the recent unidentified cultivator?)
师弟，你是来参加矿脉巡逻的吗？\n¤Junior brother, are you here to patrol the mineral vein?\n
哼，你可别把我跟古神教的疯子混为一谈。¤Hmph, don't confuse me with the madmen of the Ancient God Cult.
（似乎，探听到不得了的事情，接下来怎么办？）¤(It seems that I've heard something important, what should I do next?)
我这就离开。¤I will leave now.
你就是{FirstName}师弟吧，我这就安排你进巡逻班次。记住遇敌之时，示警尤为关键，会有坐镇的内门师兄以及附近的巡逻弟子前来支援的。\n¤You are brother {FirstName}? I will arrange for you to enter the patrol team. Remember that if you encounter an enemy, it's critical to first give out warning! Senior brothers and nearby patrolling disciples will come to support. \n
{vpunch=10,0.5}糟糕！¤{vpunch=10,0.5} Oops!
（肉身？)¤(Physical body?)
这都过去20天，除了几个沂山派的杂鱼，这里可以说是风平浪静。\n¤It's been past 20 days... Except for a few Yishan trash, it can be said to be calm here.\n
这是酬劳，30灵石收好了。¤This is the reward, thirty spirit stones all for you.
（待我小心查探一番。）\n¤(I'll check it carefully.)\n
师兄，我是来执行巡逻任务的弟子。\n¤Senior brother, I am a disciple who came to perform a patrol mission.\n
师弟，宗门重地，不要随意走动为好。\n¤Junior brother, this part of the sect is important, you shouldn't be walking around freely here. \n
具体的我也不知道，好像是他们一个长老叛逃了。正好趁此机会你们可以抓紧收集“肉参”。¤I'm not sure on the specifics but it seems like one of the elders has defected. You can take this opportunity to collect some 'Meat Ginsengs'.
古神教？有他们什么事？¤Ancient Gods? What's the matter with them?
此时，你感受到前方有一股隐匿的气息。\n¤At this time, you feel a hidden aura just ahead.\n
道友，听了这么多，还想走吗？¤Fellow daoist, after having heard so much, do you still expect to leave?
切，你还真是小心啊。\n嗯，交给我了。¤Che, you're verycareful.\nWell, leave it to me.
我们怎么行事不用你们指手画脚，不过你们到底求什么？¤We don't need you to tell us how to act, but what are you asking for?
{FirstName}师弟，你还是快点回宗门复命吧。\n¤Brother {FirstName}, you should return to the sect quickly.\n
最近这附近的人是你们的人吧？你们想干什么？这么大的动静，门内已经开始专注了，最近我们都不敢行事了。¤The people around here recently are yours, right? What do you want to do? With such big moves, the sect has begun to notice and we are afraid to act!
师兄，我明白了。\n¤Brother, I understand.\n
哈哈哈哈，反正你们师徒也没有别的选择了，到时候就知道了。¤Hahahaha, anyways, you master and disciple have no other choice, you will know then.
我不方便动手，你来吧。¤It's not convinient for me to act, so I'll leave it to you
嘿嘿嘿，我这里又不少好宝贝。¤Hey hey, I have a lot of good treasures here
你估计了一下该阵眼的危险程度，觉得有个接应也不错，于是应承下来。¤You estimated the degree of danger of the formation, so you decide to give it a try.
此外，该阵法中灵气过于狂暴，会持续造成冲击。若是{FirstName}{gongzi}灵力耗尽，不如回到在下阵法中略作调整，再行前往。¤In addition, the qi in this formation is too violent and will continue to attack you. If {FirstName}{gongzi} is hurt, it is better to go back and make adjustments in this healing formation before proceeding.
好，到时候贡献算你一份。¤Okay, this will count towards your contribution when the time comes.
在下疗伤可能要花费一点时间，不如{FirstName}{gongzi}前去关闭阵法核心，在下于此维持阵法接应{FirstName}{gongzi}。¤It may take a little time to heal my wounds. It’s better to go to {FirstName}{gongzi} to close the core of the formation and for me maintain the formation here to meet {FirstName}{gongzi}.
我输了。¤I lost.
这次不小心遇上两个禾山道的修士，差点就丢了性命。¤This time I accidentally met two cultivators from Heshan Road and almost lost my life.
施工中¤Under Construction
修真之人用{color=#d0380a}神识{/color}便可识人辨物，你这{xiaozi}神识天赋虽然不错，但还没学过什么敛息的法术，刚刚就已经被他们发现了。¤People who cultivate their {color=#d0380a}Soul Sense{/color} can identify people and objects. That {xiaozi} has a good talent for Soul sense, unfortunately you haven’t learned any spells to restrain your Qi. So you were found out immediately.
走，我们靠近点看看，说不定还能给你捞到点好处。¤Go, let's take a closer look, if we're lucky we could probably snag some goodies.
继续攻击！他真气快耗尽了！¤Keep attacking! He's running out of Qi!
你再睡糊涂，就去把那吐纳心法再背个一千遍！¤If you fall asleep one more time, go and recite the Tui Na method a thousand times!
各位追了我这一路，本少爷也打得累了，不如我们就此别过可好？¤You guys have chased me all the way here, I'm a little tired now. Why don't we just end this here and go our own separate ways?
前方传来剑气相交的声音...¤From ahead comes the sound of swords clashing...
放心吧大哥。¤Don't worry, brother.
那边的{xiongdi}！快救救我！只要救了我，我身上宝贝都是你的！¤{Xiongdi} over there! Help me! If you save me, all the treasures on my body will be yours!
要是以后传出去，说我魏无极的徒弟筑不了基，岂不是把老夫的脸都给丢尽了！¤If word spreads out in the future that Wei Wuji's apprentice can't build a Foundation, wont I lose all my face?!
臭{xiaozi}你瞎嘀咕啥呢？¤Smelly {xiaozi}, what are you mumbling about?
不错，不错。¤Not bad, not bad at all.
那些大家族的弟子哪个不是五六岁就开始学习炼气法门，你现在不好好努力，日后要是筑不了基，岂不是把老夫的脸都给丢尽了！¤The disciples of those big families who are only five or six years old have already learnt to refine Qi! If you don't work hard now and you can't build a Foundation, wouldn't it mean you're throwing away all my face?!
做够梦了没？蠢徒儿起来赶路了！¤Have you finally finished sleeping? Wake up and start training already, foolish student!
继续赶路吧，希望能找到几只刚刚产生灵智的妖兽，就当是给你练练手。¤Continue on your way, and hopefully find a few Spirit Beasts that have just developed spiritual intelligence, they shall be a good test of your abilities.
喂，老头，我们真的要去抓那什么阴磷蟒么？¤Hey, old man, are we really going to catch that Boa?
不过修行靠的还是自己的努力，昨日我教你的那些修仙者战斗的基础法门你可还记得清楚？¤Nevertheless cultivation relies on your own efforts, yesterday I taught you some basic techniques for combat, do you still remember them clearly?
有老夫在，你怕甚么？你这{xiaozi}资质平平，根基又差，不多吃点天才地宝的补补，以后想{color=#d0380a}筑基{/color}都难。¤What are you afraid of? Your {xiaozi} has mediocre aptitude and a poor foundation. If you don't use some supplimental treasures, it'll be difficult to {color=#d0380a}build a foundation{/color} in the future.
修真之人用{color=#d0380a}神识{/color}便可识人辨物，你这{xiaozi}神识也忒弱，又不懂什么敛息的法术，刚刚就已经被他们发现了。¤Cultivators can use {color=#d0380a}Soul Sense{/color} to recognize people and objects. {xiaozi} your Soul Sense is hella weak, and you don't know any techiniques to hide your Qi . That's why they discovered you so easily.
怎么说这也是已经拥有了灵智的妖兽诶，我才学了几天法术，就这几手三脚猫功夫，能对付的了它么？¤This is a spirit beast that already possesses wisdom! I have only learned spells for a few days, with these few moves, can I even deal with it?
哪里来的臭杂鱼多管闲事？¤Where the hell did this meddlesome peasant come from?
点击地图上与当前所处位置{color=#d0380a}相邻{/color}的路点，以移动至下一地点，待习得高阶遁术{color=#d0380a}御剑飞行{/color}后，即可在宁州大地图上各地点间直线移动。¤Click on a road point on the map {color=#d0380a}adjacent{/color} to your current location to move to the next location. Once you have acquired the high level evasive technique {color=#d0380a}Royal Sword Flight{/color}, you can quickly fly across various locations on the large map of Ning Province.
{vpunch=10,0.5}咦，老头，前面好像有动静，我们要不要先回避一下？¤{vpunch=10,0.5} Hey, old man, there seems to be something going on ahead, should we avoid it?
朋友，偷听半天了，现在才想跑不觉得太晚了么？¤Friend, you've been eavesdropping for a long time, isn't it too late to just want to run now?
唉，你确实是个好苗子，只可惜我没了{color=#d0380a}记忆{/color}，传不了你更多功法，你进境缓慢，我也问心有愧。¤Alas, you are indeed a good child, it's unfortunate I've lost my {color=#d0380a}memory{/color} and can not pass on better techniques to you, slowing down your overall progress, I feel quite ashamed.
夺人所好可不是正道所为，道友，我来助你！¤It's not right to bully others! Fellow Daoist, I'll help you!
有老夫在，你怕甚么？你这{xiaozi}虽然资质不错，但修行起步太晚。¤This is an old man, what are you afraid of? Although {xiaozi} has good aptitude, you started practicing too late.
（既然都被发现了，还不如主动出手）¤(Since we have been discovered, we might as well take the initiative)
（欸！这气息，难道附近还有修仙者？？？）¤(Huh? The breathe of Qi.. Is there a cultivator nearby???)
若不是老夫当年有元婴巅峰的修为，这点儿残魂能活一千多年嘛？哼，等老夫恢复了{color=#d0380a}记忆{/color}...¤If it weren't for the old man's cultivation base at the peak of the Nascent Soul, could the remnant soul live for more than a thousand years? Huh, wait for the old man to recover his {color=#d0380a}memory{/color}...
（低声）谁让您老把那些重要的功法神通都给忘得一干二净的，看来这脸是丢定咯~¤(Whispering) Who makes you forget all those important exercises and supernatural powers? It seems that this face is ashamed~
喂，老头你嘀咕啥呢？¤Hey, old man, what are you mumbling about?
哼，不管你是哪路少爷，坏了我们沂山派的好事，就拿你人头来抵！¤Hmph, I don't care where you are from, you meddled with us Mt. Yi sect. I will make sure that you are dead!
我魏无极栖身此剑数百年，也没见过你这样糟心的徒弟。才多练了这么点灵气，就昏睡到了现在，如此下去，你啥时候才能到筑基期？¤I, Wei Wuji, have been inhabiting this sword for hundreds of years, but I have never seen such a vexing disciple like you. You've just barely started cultivating your spiritual Qi this morning, and you've fallen fast asleep all the way til now. If you continue on at this rate, when will you reach the foundation-building stage?
额，难道他在叫我？¤Uh, don't tell me he's talking about me?
！！！不会吧，那我该咋办？¤!!! No way, what should I do now?
嗯，这也难怪。修习这类神通，最重要的还是实战运用。只有在对敌时能灵活使用它们，才算真正的入门。¤Well, it's no wonder. The most important thing in practicing these types of skills is to use them in actual combat. Only when you can use them flexibly against the enemy can you be said to have truly mastered them.
唔...这几个小朋友倒是有几分本事，是老夫失策了。¤Um... these kids are actually quite good, I might have made a mistake....
那人就交给你去收拾，记住，别留活口！¤That one is yours to take care of. Remember, no witnesses!
不就是几个炼气期的小朋友在小打小闹，瞧把你给紧张的。¤It's only a couple of kids in the Qi refining stage play fighting, look how nervous they made you.
魏老，这也不能怪我啊。从拜您为师到现在，也不过短短几个月，每天不是赶路就是练功，如今勉强进入炼气期，已经很不错了……¤Master Wei, I can't be blamed for this. It’s only been a few months since you've become my master. Every single day has been devoted to either cultivating or practicing martial arts. Me just entering the Qi-Refining stage so quickly can be considered a huge accomplishment!
（惨了，这下怕是凶多吉少……）¤(Dammit, I'm afraid things might get really bad......)
吾乃金虹剑派授业长老{FirstName}{LastName}，本次仙资大会就由我来主持。¤I am the Instructing Elder of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect, {FirstName}{LastName}, and I will be presiding over this competition.
呼~诸多琐事，很是麻烦啊，当年大师兄也辛苦了啊~¤Phew~ So many trivial matters, it's a lot of trouble. Big Brother had a hard time back then too~
负责此事的执事示意你人已到齐，你飞至半空中，居高临下的看着下方人群。¤The deacon in charge of this matter signals to you that everyone has arrived, you fly into the air and look down at the crowd below.
接下来流程就和你当年进入宗门一般无二....¤The process that follows is the same as when you entered the clan ....
诸位既然来到了这里，请务必听清在下所讲的每一句话，这将直接关系到诸位能否进入本门。¤Now that you are here, please make sure you listen to every word I say, as it will have a direct bearing on whether or not you can enter our sect.
他们出身各有不同，但相同的是眼中的渴望。¤Their origins were different, but what was the same was the desire in their eyes.
吾乃竹山宗授业长老{FirstName}{LastName}，本次招新大会就由我来主持。¤I am the Zhushan Sect's Ordained Elder {FirstName}{LastName}, and this recruitment meeting will be conducted by me.
当年同批的弟子，现在也仅剩我们寥寥几人罢了。¤The same batch of disciples back then, now there are only a few of us left.
呼~诸多琐事，很是麻烦啊，当年大师姐也辛苦了啊~¤Phew ~ many trivial matters, is very troublesome ah, when the big sister also worked hard ah ~
吾乃化尘教授业长老{FirstName}{LastName}，小友你通过了入门测试，现在就由我来为你测试灵根。¤I am Elder Ye {FirstName}{LastName} of the Hualianduan Professor, young friend you have passed the initiation test, now I will test your spiritual roots.
是不是看着他们想到了当年的自己？¤Does looking at them remind you of yourself back then?
哈哈哈，只是有点感慨罢了，一晃眼已经加入宗门这么久了，但入门好像又在昨日。¤Hahaha, just a bit emotional, it's been so long since I joined the clan, but the initiation seems like yesterday again.
接下来流程就和你之前组织的招新会一般无二....¤The process that follows is just like the recruitment meetings you have organised before ....
不感慨了，先办正事吧。¤No more emotions, let's get down to business.
凡是天灵根和双灵根资质道友，请先站出来吧。¤All Daoists with Heavenly Spiritual Root and Double Spiritual Root qualifications, please come forward first.
吾乃竹山宗授业长老{FirstName}{LastName}，本次招新大会就由我来.....¤I am the teaching elder of the Zhushan Sect {FirstName}{LastName}, and this recruitment meeting will be held by me .....
最后仅有数人被带到你面前。¤Only a few are brought before you at the end.
你飞至半空中，居高临下的看着下方人群。¤You fly into mid-air and look down at the crowd below.
广场上一阵骚动，过了一好阵也没人出列。¤There was a commotion in the square, and after a good while no one came out of line.
{FirstName}长老，开始每次宗门招新大会么？¤Elder {FirstName}, start the all clan recruitment meeting?
剩下的人只要能通过我们擂台的比试，一样可以成为我们竹山宗的外门弟子。¤The rest of you can become outer disciples of our Bamboo Mountain Sect just as long as you can pass the competition in our ring.
在宗门执事和外门弟子的安排下，很多人熙熙攘攘的进入了宗门。¤Under the arrangement of the clan deacons and outer disciples, many people bustled into the clan.
吾乃金虹剑派授业长老{FirstName}{LastName}，本次仙资大会就由我来主持...¤I am the Ordained Elder of the Golden Rainbow Sword School {FirstName}{LastName}, and I will be presiding over this Immortal Capital Conference...
下方的人群在宗门执事的引导下纷纷踏上了那考验心性的火焰之路。¤The crowds below were guided by the clan's deacons as they set off on the flaming path that tested the strength of their minds.
负责此事的执事将通过考验人带到你面前。¤The deacon in charge of this matter bring the person who has passed the test to you.
我们金虹剑派的仙资大会，无论年龄性别，但凡身具灵根者皆可以来养剑池前进行测试。¤At our Golden Rainbow Sword School's Immortal Qualification Conference, anyone with spiritual roots can come and be tested in front of the Sword Raising Pond, regardless of their age or gender.
你飞至半空中，居高临下的看着下方人群在宗门执事的引导下纷纷踏上了那考验心性的火焰之路。¤You fly into mid-air, watching from above as the crowd below you are guided by the sect's deacons through the flaming path that tests the strength of their minds.
我派...¤I send...
吾乃星河剑派授业长老{FirstName}{LastName}，本次招新大会就由我来主持。¤I am the Ordained Elder of the Star River Sword School {FirstName}{LastName}, and I will be presiding over this recruitment meeting.
是啊，漫漫仙途，长生难觅啊。¤Yes, it's hard to find long life on the long road to immortality.
负责此事的执事示意你人已到齐，你飞至半空中置身于剑河之内，居高临下的看着下方人群。¤The deacon in charge of this matter signals to you that everyone is here, and you fly into mid-air above the river of swords, looking down at the crowd below.
{xiaozi}？发什么呆啊？¤{xiaozi}? What's wrong with you?
能够在大阵之中坚持下来，并得到灵剑认可之人，就有资格成为我派外门弟子。至于能否得到灵剑的认可，就看各位的悟性了。¤Those who are able to persevere in the great formation and receive the Spirit Sword's approval will be qualified to become outer disciples of our sect. Whether or not you can gain the Spirit Sword's approval will depend on your enlightenment.
他们中既有普通的凡人，也有血气充盈的先天武者，甚至也不乏已经初入仙途的炼气期修士。¤Among them are ordinary mortals, as well as blood-filled innate martial artists, and even Qi Refining stage cultivators who have already made their first steps into the immortal path.
吾乃离火门授业长老{FirstName}{LastName}，你们即已通过考验便是我离火门弟子....¤I am the Elder of the Heavenly Fire Gate, {FirstName}{LastName}, you have passed the test and are now my disciples of the Heavenly Fire Gate ....
他们之中大部分人难以忍受高温的炙烤便选择的了放弃，之后自有宗门弟子将他们带离。¤Most of them couldn't stand the heat and gave up, after which the clan's disciples took them away.
最后仅有数人完成了试炼被带到你面前。¤In the end only a few completed the trials and were brought before you.
看着他们你陷入了回忆...¤Looking at them you are caught up in memories...
有事没事还总想着打扰我睡...疗伤，真是火大。¤Always trying to disturb my sleep when there's nothing else to do... Healing, what a fire.
{size=31}而且中州还有师兄坐镇，天魔道那帮混蛋至少得留下一个化神坐镇宗门。{/size}¤{size=31}And with a senior brother sitting in Central Province, those bastards from the Heavenly Demon Path must have left at least one Deity Transformation sitting in the sect. {/size}
你见混元子和火麒麟大有要吵起来的架势，便朝明山散人点了点头，笑着离开了。¤When you saw that the Mixer and the Fire Qilin were about to get into a fight, you nodded towards the Ming Mountain Scatterer and left with a smile.
我代师兄多谢诸位愿前来观礼。¤On behalf of my brother, I would like to thank you all for your willingness to come and observe the ceremony.
我倒是有些担心，毕竟...算了不必涨他人威风。¤I was a bit worried, after all... Never mind no need to boost the prestige of others.
可惜混元子即便不用灵气增幅，他的声音也已经占据了整片岛屿。任你离开，一人一兽互揭老底的争吵声也还是对你纠缠不休，一时间岛上满是快活的气氛。¤Unfortunately, even without the use of the aura increase, the sound of the hybrid son's voice has taken over the whole island. No matter how much you leave, the bickering of one man and one beast revealing each other is still pestering you, and for a while the island is filled with a fastidious atmosphere.
一人一兽互揭老底的争吵声不绝于耳，一时间岛上满是快活的气氛。¤The island was full of fastidiousness for a while as one man and one beast bickered and revealed each other.
我看也是，那古神教也就一个化神修士，实力还很一般，只敢在背后搞些邪门歪道。¤I think so, that Ancient God Cult is only one Deity Transformation Cultivator, and his strength is still average, he only dares to do some evil things behind the scenes.
你向正在谈天论地的三人组走去。¤You walk towards the trio who are talking about it.
这和我知道的可不一样，若不是这位{daoyou}与我离火门炎萧长老相助，只怕上次你就中了调虎离山之计失守天魔眼了。¤This is not the same as what I know, if not for the help of this {daoyou} and my Heavenly Fire Gate Yan Xiao elders, I'm afraid that last time you would have been caught in the scheme of transferring the tiger away from the mountain and lost the Heavenly Demon Eye.
{size=31}这{xiaozi}可是凌老儿的人，宁州谁还不知道我和凌老儿同气连枝！{/size}¤{size=31}This {xiaozi} is one of Ling's people. Who in Ning Province doesn't know that I'm in the same boat as Ling! {/size}
{size=31}有什么好谢的，凌老儿的计划虽是冒险了点，但我看还是能行的。{/size}¤{size=31}What's to thank you for? Old man Ling's plan is a bit risky, but I think it will work. {/size}
见过诸位前辈，多谢诸位愿前来观礼。¤Greetings, seniors, and many thanks for your willingness to come and watch.
{size=31}哼，他们有什么可威风的，敢不敢前来夺剑还不一定呢。我玄道宗镇守天魔眼何止千载，天魔道有占过上风么？{/size}¤{size=31}Hmph, what's so awesome about them? It's not certain if they dare to come and take the sword. I have been guarding the Heavenly Demon Eye for thousands of years, but has the Heavenly Demon Dao ever had the upper hand? {/size}
眼前是一具硕大且破败的尸骸，源源不断死气四溢开来，尸骸上开出一朵渊血冥花。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you want to do.
不过此地是上古战场、极阴大凶之地，定有此等宝物产出。¤But this is an ancient battlefield, a place of great evil, there must be such treasures produced.
鲲龙两族一身是宝，但随着时间都毁于一旦了，可惜可惜啊，不过也不算是没有收获。¤Kun Long two clans all over the treasure, but with time are destroyed, pity pity ah, but it is not no harvest.
眼前是一具硕大且破败的龙尸，源源不断死气四溢开来，尸骸上蜿蜒盘旋着一颗枯草。¤In front of you is a large and decrepit dragon corpse, the source of death gas overflowing open, the corpse meandering hovering a withered grass.
眼前是一具硕大且破败的尸骸，源源不断死气四溢开来，一颗厉魂血珀浮于空中。¤In front of you is a large and broken corpse, a constant stream of dead air overflowing, a Li soul blood perforation floating in the air.
你眼前巨大的龙骨、鲲骨，空中弥漫着死气。¤The huge dragon bones and kun bones in front of you, the air is filled with the aura of death.
一股强大的力量将你甩了出去，不知道飞了多久你才稳住身形。无奈你只得继续踏上了旅程。¤A powerful force threw you out, and I don't know how long it took you to stabilize your body. Unfortunately, you have to continue on your journey.
他还这么小，我没办法就放下他一个人不管...¤He is still so small, I can not leave him alone...
是最差的五灵根...对灵气倒是还有微弱的反应，但仅凭自己吐纳恐怕一辈子也入不了门...¤It is the worst of the five spiritual roots... He still has a weak response to aura, but I'm afraid he'll never be able to enter the door in his lifetime just by exhaling...
她虽然是笑着，但眼神中却流露出一丝落寞的神情。¤Although she was smiling, a look of despondency passed through her eyes.
呼...吸...¤Exhale... Inhale...
咳咳...是先..¤Ahem... It was first...
有点凉凉的？莫非是因为第一次引气入体么...¤It's a bit cold? Could it be because it's the first time I've drawn Qi into my body...
咳咳...我也是才来。你这是在教这孩子引气入体的吐纳法门么？¤Ahem... I've just come too. Are you teaching this boy the exhalation technique of drawing Qi into the body?
接下来就要靠他自己努力修炼，才能有所进境了。希望他勤能补拙，不要辜负你对他的一片心意。¤Next it will be up to him to work hard on his own to make progress. I hope that he will be able to make up for his mistakes by being diligent and will not fail to live up to your intentions for him.
小孩：...¤Children: ...
啊！什么人来了？¤Ah! What person came?
啊...{$TmpTalkString}愿意试试么？那太好了！¤Ah... Would {$TmpTalkString} like to try it? That would be great!
小孩：好像...有点凉凉的？¤Kid: It seems... A little cooler?
这...我只是恰好路过而已。¤It's... I just happened to be passing by.
啊！{$TmpTalkString}是什么时候来的？¤Ah! When did {$TmpTalkString} come in?
啊...是我的要求唐突了。¤Ah... It was my request that was abrupt.
但我好像不是很有教学的天赋...我从小就在星河剑派长大，三四岁时便跟着师姐们一起修炼，好像是在不知不觉间就学会了这些基础的吐纳方法。¤But I don't seem to be very gifted at teaching... I grew up in the Star River Sword School and followed my sisters when I was three or four years old, and it seems that I learned these basic exhalation methods without realizing it.
嗯...我相信他一定可以的。¤Well... I'm sure he'll be fine.
噢...原来是{$TmpTalkString}。抱歉，平日里接触的少，一时竟没有认出你来。¤Oh... So it's {$TmpTalkString}. I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you for a while because I don't have much contact with you on a regular basis.
怎么样，有感觉了么？¤How about it, feel it yet?
小孩：呼...¤Kids: Hoo...
吐惟细细，纳维绵绵，若存若亡，似有似无，方为真息...¤The true breath is when the exhalation is fine and the nasal dimension is continuous, if it exists or dies, if it seems to exist or not...
很好，记住这种感觉。能够引气入体，乃修炼的第一步。¤It's good to remember that feeling. Being able to draw Qi into the body is the first step in cultivation.
你且盘腿坐好，双手阖于丹田之下，跟着我一起吐纳，细细体悟丹田之中的感受。¤Sit with your legs crossed and your hands closed under your dantian, and follow me as I exhale and feel the sensations in the dantian.
嗯...该从哪里开始呢？¤Hmmm... Where should I start?
你跟着我念。¤You read after me.
是啊，这孩子叫石头，是前些日子我奉命剿灭山贼时救下来的，可惜他的父母都已经...¤Yes, this boy is called Stone, I saved him some days ago when I was ordered to exterminate some bandits, but unfortunately his parents...
{$TmpTalkString}，你真厉害，居然一下就想出了这么好的办法。¤{$TmpTalkString}, you're amazing to have come up with such a good idea in one go.
再往前就是我派风雷谷驻地了，{$TmpTalkString}若无要事的话，还是不要在这里逗留了。¤Further ahead is our faction's Wind and Thunder Valley compound. {$TmpTalkString}If you have no important business, it is better not to stay here.
还好这次有你帮我，如果只靠我自己的话...¤Luckily I have you to help me this time, if I had to do it on my own...
小孩：吸...¤Children: Sigh...
咳咳...看来直接教他口诀好像行不通...¤Ahem... It doesn't seem to work to teach him the mantra directly...
吹嘘呼吸，吐故纳新。呼...吸...¤Bragging about breathing and exhaling. Exhale... Inhale...
你继续练习吐纳，等你能够熟练引气入体以后，再根据口诀尝试运转灵气，到时候便可算是入门了。¤Continue to practice your exhalation, and when you are skilled in drawing Qi into your body, then try to run the Spiritual Qi according to the recipe, and you will be considered to have started by then.
这件事与{$TmpTalkString}本来就没什么关系的...我...我还是自己想办法吧！¤This is not something that has anything to do with {$TmpTalkString} in the first place... I... I'd better figure it out myself!
小孩：丹田附近好像有一股暖流，很舒服...¤Child: There seems to be a warm current near the dantian, very comfortable...
不过自己知道怎么做，和能够教会别人真是完全不一样呢。¤But knowing how to do it yourself and being able to teach others are really quite different.
你...是谁？来这里是有什么事么？¤You... Who is it? Are you here for something?
是啊。不过凝霜长老说，我们修真者总有一天是要斩断凡尘的。我没有这种牵挂，反倒能够更静心于修炼呢。¤Yes. But Elder Ningshang said that we cultivators have to cut off the mortal world one day. Without such attachments, I am able to concentrate more on my cultivation.
嗯...这基础的吐纳心法你也练了一段时间了。怎么样...有感觉了么？¤Well... You've been practicing this basic exhalation technique for a while now. How about... Do you feel it yet?
小孩：谢谢大哥哥，谢谢白姐姐！我一定会努力修炼的！¤Kid: Thank you, big brother and thank you, sister Bai! I'll definitely work hard on my training!
那孩子有些茫然地看向你。¤The boy looks at you a little blankly.
你之前说，你从小就是在星河剑派长大的？¤You said before that you were brought up in the Star River Sword School?
对了！要把周天灵气汇聚起来。只要能感应到灵气，以后再修炼吐纳之法便可事半功倍了。¤That's right! To bring together the circumferential aura. As long as you can sense the aura, you will be able to practise the method of exhalation later with half the effort.
我派从不允许男性入门，所以我只能偷偷把他带来风雷谷，想教会他一些基础的修炼法门。¤My school never allows men to be initiated, so I had to secretly bring him to Wind and Thunder Valley, trying to teach him some basic cultivation techniques.
虽然已经教会了这孩子最基础的吐纳法门，不过以他的资质，恐怕日后成就不会很高。¤Although the boy has been taught the most basic exhalation technique, I am afraid that with his qualifications, his achievements will not be very high in the future.
（难怪她这么想帮那个孩子...）¤(No wonder she wanted to help the boy so much...)
啊...是这样的。¤Ah... It's like this.
原来只是风吹的么...¤So it's just the wind blowing...
你拉过那孩子的手，将一丝微弱的灵气输入他的体内。¤You take the boy's hand and put a weak trace of aura into his body.
小孩：谢谢大姐姐！我一定会努力修炼的！¤Kid: Thanks big sister! I'll definitely work hard on my training!
所以，你其实一直不知道自己父母的身份么？¤So you never actually knew who your parents were?
当年魏老是怎么教我的来着...？¤What did Wei teach me back then...?
{$TmpTalkString}，你能帮我教教这孩子么？¤{$TmpTalkString}, can you help me teach this child?
太好了，那以后便可以和{$TmpTalkString}多多联系了！¤Great, then we can get in touch with {$TmpTalkString} more often!
这种事情我也不太擅长，应该帮不了你。¤I'm not very good at this sort of thing either, so I shouldn't be able to help you.
我明白的...但就算以后没法筑基，也多少有些强身健体和延年益寿的功效。¤I understand... But even if you can't build a foundation in the future, it's still somewhat effective in strengthening your body and prolonging your life.
你运转调息之下，周天灵气都被你尽可能的汇聚于此地。¤As you run and tune in, all the spiritual energy of the circumference is gathered here as much as you can.
听凝霜长老说，我母亲曾经也是星河剑派的弟子，但是生下我以后就独自离开了宗门，也不知去了哪里。¤I heard from Elder Ningshang that my mother was once also a disciple of the Xinghe Sword Sect, but left the sect alone after giving birth to me, and I don't know where she went.
小孩：吐惟...细细，呐...呐...？¤Kids: Toodle-oo... Tiny, na... Na...?
对了，我看你似乎是在教这孩子引气入体的吐纳法门么?¤By the way, does it seem to me that you are teaching this child the exhalation technique of drawing Qi into the body?
他输了也并不气馁，只是看向你的目光仿佛别有用意。¤He is not discouraged when he loses, he just looks at you as if he had no intention of doing so.
纸上龙飞凤舞地写着几个大字“勿拍，结束后请至公孙府——公孙季”。¤On the paper, there are a few large characters Don't shoot, please go to Gongsun Mansion-Gongsun Ji after it is over.
你坐回自己的位置继续吃茶，片刻后收到小厮呈上的笺纸。¤Sit back to your place and continue to eat tea. After a while, you receive a piece of paper from the young man.
我派与星河剑派有诸多渊源，功法神通虽各有特色，却也一脉相承。¤My school and the Galaxy Sword School have many origins. Although their skills and supernatural powers have their own characteristics, they are also in the same line.
所谓师傅领进门，修行在个人...剑道无穷，各人自有各人的领悟。¤The so-called master leads the door, and the practice lies in the individual...Swordsmanship is endless, and each person has his own understanding.
这无尽之海，实在是凶险异常啊！我师弟前些日子第一次出海，不多时便在海上失去了音讯。我此次就是奉师尊之命，前去寻他，唉...¤This endless sea is really dangerous and dangerous! My junior went to sea for the first time a few days ago, and soon lost news on the sea. This time, I am on the order of the master to look for him, alas...
若出现两位选手胜场与天机点都相同的情况，我们将会记录双方对手的天机点总和作为排名依据。¤If there is a situation where both players have the same number of wins and Tengiz points, we will record the total number of Tengiz points of both opponents as the basis for ranking.
若道友已经准备妥当，只需前往比试即可。¤If you have already prepared properly, you can simply go to the competition.
呵呵，擂台上的屏障会检验您体内有无药力，若有的话，则会自动将您体内的药力清除，绝无作弊的可能。¤The barrier in the ring will check whether there is medicine power in your body, if there is, it will automatically remove the medicine power from your body, there is no possibility of cheating.
道友可还有什么疑问？¤Do you have any questions?
你环顾四周，并未在附近发现倪旭欣的身影，想来应当是被错乱的空间传送到了其他什么地方吧...¤You look around, but you didn't find Ni XuXin nearby. I think it should have been teleported to some other place by the chaotic space...
你们这些废物，连个剑阵都破不了，混元子老子没空和你玩。¤You rubbish, you can't even break a sword formation, Hun Yuanzi I don't have time to play with you.
说罢，也不管下面的人带着身边人化作血雾飞遁而去。¤After all, it doesn't matter if the people below take the people around them and flee away.
前辈不必如此，多亏您及时来援，四象封魔阵毫发无损。¤Thanks to your timely assistance, the Four Elephant Demon Sealing Formation was unscathed.
此番凶险，真是辛苦你了。你能力战元婴期老魔，我此时身无外物，这些了灵石还望道友不要嫌弃。¤This dangerous danger, it's really hard for you. You are capable of fighting the old demon of the Yuanying stage, I have no foreign objects at this time, and I hope that fellow daoists should not dislike it after these spirit stones.
倪振东退出剑阵，来到你面前。¤Ni Zhendong withdrew from the sword formation and came to you.
击败了那人后，你想向那名女子询问他们的目的，却发现此人已不见了踪影...¤After defeating that person, you want to ask the woman about their purpose, but you find that this person is no longer visible...
你们究竟......¤What do you guys...
细想这几日发生的事情，宁王府或许并不像表面看来这么简单。荣华富贵虽好，若无命享受也是白搭。¤Thinking about what happened in the past few days, Prince Ning's Mansion may not be as simple as it seems. Although glory and wealth are good, it is useless to enjoy it if you have no life.
左思右想下，你决定还是趁早离开这滩浑水。¤Think about it, you decide to leave this muddy water as early as possible.
呼...还好解决了，没想到弄出这么大动静。¤Huh...fortunately, it's solved, I didn't expect to make such a big movement.
哈哈哈，多谢{$daoyou}相助，这是答应给你的报酬。¤Hahaha, thanks {$daoyou} for your help, this is the promised reward for you.
魔门竟在那时便渗入我教内部...看来此行结束有必要肃整门派了。¤The magic gate actually infiltrated my teaching at that time... It seems that it is necessary to clean up the sect at the end of this trip.
炼心芝...！有了此物，必定可令掌门早日突破！¤Heartrend Shroom...! With this, the Sect Leader can surely make a breakthrough soon!
天道崩塌，吾有一剑足矣。¤The Ways of Heaven collapses, I just need one sword.
天魔眼？区区低等魔物，不足道尔。¤The eye of the demon? It's a mere low-level monster, it's not worth it.
此后数日，你在百里府中与百里奇切磋斗法，交流悟道，两人都因此而受益匪浅。¤In the next few days, you will compete with Bailiqi in Baili Mansion and exchange enlightenment. Both of them have benefited a lot from this.
闻言百里邑眼中闪过一丝精光，看向你的目光中明显带了几分打量，像是在盘算些什么。¤Hearing that a gleam of light flashed in Bailiyi's eyes, the gaze that looked at you was obviously looking at you, as if thinking about something.
广陵城因常有妖兽来袭，城镇外围的居民面容多有惊忧之色。但百里府内并无这种惶惶之感，你随百里奇一路走来，府中和乐安逸，和边陲恍非一城。¤Because of the frequent attacks of monsters and beasts in Guangling City, the residents on the periphery of the town have a look of worry. But there is no such panic in Baili Mansion. You follow Bailiqi all the way, and the mansion is peaceful and peaceful, and The border is not a city.
呵呵，难得有与奇儿实力相仿的同龄人，能够一起切磋悟道，对各自的修为精进也很有好处。¤Hehe, it's rare that there are people of the same age who are similar in strength to Qier, who can learn and understand the Tao together, which is also very good for their own cultivation.
父亲，{FirstName}道友实力不俗，我邀他入府正是为了讨教一二。¤Father, {FirstName} Taoist Fellow is quite strong. I invited him into the mansion just to ask for advice.
在下{FirstName}{LastName}，见过百里家主。¤Under {FirstName}{LastName}, I have met Patriarch Baili.
{FirstName}道友，请。¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, please.
此乃家父百里邑，也是百里家家主。¤This is my father, Bailiyi, and the head of the Baili family.
这种微妙的差异使你察觉到一丝异样，却又说不出违和的源头。思虑间你二人已行至百里府大堂，一位相貌中正的中年人端坐堂上。¤This subtle difference makes you aware of a slight strangeness, but you can't tell the source of the violation. You two have already walked to the lobby of Baili Mansion in your thoughts, and a right-looking middle-aged man sat in the hall.
哼，我来会会你。¤Hmph, I will meet you.
难道这宁王年年在那斗法台招募供奉，居然是这等缘由！¤Could it be that Ning King recruits guest elders through fighting arenas every year for this very reason!
苍老男声:待我部署一下，今晚再到老地方来找我。¤Old male voice: Wait for me to make arrangements, and come to the old place to find me tonight.
年轻女声：诺！¤Young female voice: Got it!
我就继续悄悄跟着她，倒是要看看他们还想耍什么手段...¤I will continue to follow her quietly, but to see what other tricks they want to do...
年轻女声：长老此次传唤可有要事？¤Young female voice: Is there something important for the elder to summon this time?
索性发现的早，此时逃走应该还来得及，还是不要再多管闲事了...¤It was discovered early, it should be too late to escape at this time, so don't worry about it anymore...
苍老男声:宁王那边进展如何？¤Old male voice: How is Ning King's progress?
年轻女声：新的一批供奉已入住王府，收取他们性命犹如探囊取物，只候长老下令！¤Young female voice: A new batch of Guest Elders have moved into the palace. Collecting their lives is like a walk in a park, only awaiting orders from the elders!
宁王对此事应该不会一无所知，说不定更是早有勾结...想不到逸风城表面风光霁月，实则烟雾尘天。¤Wang Ning should not be ignorant of this matter, maybe there was collusion earlier... I can't imagine that the surface of Yifeng City is beautiful, but it is actually smog.
若只是这样就好了。本来都只当他是个武痴，却没想这魔修跑去个名不见经传的小门派大闹了一番，还灭其满门。后来还是有人前往那门派查看，纠其神通之源，才得以知悉此人竟是血剑宫魔修。¤If only that was the case. Originally, he only thought that he was a martial arts idiot, but he didn't think that this evil cultivator would go to a little-known sect to make a lot of trouble, and also destroy its whole family. Later, some people went to the sect to check and correct the source of their magical powers, only to know that this person was actually a blood sword palace evil cultivator.
也只能如此了。¤That's all there is to it.
血剑宫的魔修？¤The evil cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace?
但血剑宫的魔修向来实力强劲，{$ZaiXia}虽对自己的实力有信心，但也不想独自面对这血剑宫邪修。¤However, the evil cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace has always been strong. Although {$ZaiXia} has confidence in his own strength, he does not want to face the evil cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace alone.
那我先谢过{FirstName}{$NickName}了。¤Then I would like to thank {FirstName}{$NickName} in advance.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，好久不见。¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, long time no see.
道友有何计划？¤Do you have any plans?
简短地说，就是{$ZaiXia}宗门附近疑似有血剑宫的魔修在四处活动，所以遣我去调查一番。若是寻得其行迹，最好能解决这魔修。¤To put it simply, there is a suspected evil cultivator in the Blood Sword Palace near the sect of {$ZaiXia}, so I was sent to investigate. If you can find its trace, it is best to solve this evil cultivator.
嗯，据称那人之前四处找人比试，但因其出手狠辣，鲜有人敢与他切磋。¤Well, it is said that the man had been looking around for a test before, but because of his ruthlessness, few people dared to compare with him.
所以想请{FirstName}{$NickName}与{$ZaiXia}同行。¤So I would like to invite {FirstName}{$NickName} with {$ZaiXia}.
多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}。¤Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName}.
不知道友此番找我何事？¤I don't know what my friend is looking for me this time?
咳，我目前对于这血剑宫魔修也没有更多消息，所以暂时没有成熟的计划。¤Ahem, I don't have any more news about this Blood Sword Palace evil cultivator at the moment, so I don't have a mature plan for the time being.
唉，这小门派又是在{$ZaiXia}宗门左近，为防其加害我派弟子，也只得走上一遭了。唉，真是烦人。\n¤Alas, this little sect is close to the {$ZaiXia} sect again, and in order to prevent it from harming my disciples, I had to go for a while. Alas, how annoying. \n
此类修士虽然少见，但我熟识的一位修士也是如此。躲着点便是了。¤Such cultivators are rare, but so is one I know well. Just hide.
要不，{FirstName}{$NickName}先与我一同去那个小门派察看一番，再做下一步打算？¤Why don't {FirstName}{$NickName} go with me to inspect that little sect before making any plans?
既是如此，我还有任务在身，就不多叨扰道友了。¤That being the case, I still have a task at hand, so I won't bother my fellow Daoists.
自上次一别确实有些时日了。¤It's been a while since the last goodbye.
诸位，本次宗门大比已决出了前四位弟子，他们都是我们离火门中年轻一辈的精英，肩负着我们离火门的未来。¤Everyone, this Zongmen Grand Competition has decided on the first four disciples. They are all the elites of the younger generation of our Heavenly Fire Gate, and they shoulder our future for Heavenly Fire Gate.
随着一声惨叫，血河老祖已在你的神通之下倒向海面，也不知是死是活。¤With a miserable cry, Patriarch Blood River has fallen to the sea under your divine power, and it is not known whether he is dead or alive.
不知从何处传来一道神念攻击，正打在血河老祖身上，疼的他哇哇乱叫。你趁此机会，连忙扭身躲到了众人身后。¤A divine thought attack came from nowhere and struck Patriarch Blood River squarely, causing him to wail in pain. You took this opportunity and hurriedly twisted around to hide behind the crowd.
面对血河老祖的追击，你已无力调动灵气，只能眼睁睁的看着猩红色充满你的眼帘。¤Faced with the pursuit of Patriarch Blood River, you are no longer able to mobilise your aura and can only watch as the scarlet colour fills your eyes.
历代血剑仙在九州树下的威名，随着你的神通，随着血河伤落向海面，随着几大势力其他化神的惊叹声，出现了不可磨灭的裂痕！¤The fame of the Blood Sword Immortal under the tree of Kyushu through the ages has appeared indelibly cracked with your divine power, with the fall of the blood river wound to the sea, and with the exclamations of the other Deity Transformation of the several great powers!
猝不及防之下，数道猩红色的剑气斩击到你的灵气护罩之上，后者则是以肉眼可见的速度迅速褪色，乃至破碎开来。¤Caught off guard, several scarlet Sword Qi slashes into your aura shield, which rapidly fades and even shatters at a speed visible to the naked eye.
但眼下，正道的化神修士们已经落了下风，除了火麒麟外，无一不是勉励在支撑着，也不知能否拖到白帝渡劫完成。¤But right now, the Deity Transformation cultivators of the Righteous Path have fallen behind, and apart from the Fire Qilin, all of them are barely holding on, not knowing whether they can delay until the White Emperor's tribulation is completed.
死在血剑仙的剑下是你的荣幸，桀桀桀，上路吧！¤It is your honor to die under the sword of the Blood Sword Immortal, Jie Jie Jie, go on your way!
未等你追击重伤得血河老祖，混元子的大嗓门已是传到你的耳边。¤Before you can chase after the seriously injured Patriarch Blood River, the loud voice of the Hybrid Son is already reaching your ears.
血河可能是在场魔门中最弱的化神，但他毕竟也是一个化神修士。本就不占上风的正道修士们渐渐开始支撑不住。¤Blood River might be the weakest Deity Transformation among the Demon Sect present, but he was still a Deity Transformation practitioner after all. The Just Dao cultivators, who were already not in the upper hand, gradually began to be unable to support themselves.
半空之上，白帝又是一剑劈开了劫云。但或许是刚刚的心魔劫的确对他产生了一些影响，又或是为了兼顾施展秘术，总之，他的神情也不像刚开始那般从容了。¤In mid-air, Emperor Bai slashed through the robbery cloud with another sword. But perhaps it was because the Heart Demon Tribulation had indeed had some effect on him just now, or in order to juggle the execution of his secret techniques, in any case, he did not look as calm as he did at the beginning.
好在你的胜利鼓舞了正道的化神修士们，虽然还没拖到白帝渡劫完成，但至少扭转了被牢牢压制的局面。¤The good thing is that your victory has inspired the Deity Transformation cultivators of the Righteous Path to at least reverse the situation where they were firmly suppressed, even though they have not yet delayed the completion of the White Emperor's tribulation.
果然，血薇仙子的攻势一滞，让原本被打得毫无还手之力的白鹿真人瞬间轻松了不少。¤Sure enough, the Blood Violet Fairy's attack stalled, making it instantly easier for the White Deer Reality, who had been beaten senseless, to fight back.
血剑宫威名在外，没想到麾下却有实力如此不济的化神修士。¤The Blood Sword Palace is famous for its prestige, but I never thought that there would be such an underpowered Deity Transformation cultivator under its command.
{size=31}血亢老狗，养出血河这样的废物，我看你们血剑宫的威风也就到这啦哈哈哈。{/size}¤{size=31}Blood hyper old dog, raising a waste like Blood River, I think your Blood Sword Palace's prestige is only here hahaha. {/size}
几番交手下，你自知不是血河老祖的对手，连忙躲至众人身后。他见此嚣张的大笑起来，转而又冲向了白鹿真人。¤After a few exchanges, you know that you are no match for Patriarch Blood River and rush to hide behind the crowd. Seeing this, he laughed arrogantly and turned to rush towards the White Deer Reality.
啊啊啊啊啊...¤Ahhhhhhhhh...
即便血剑宫本就不擅防御，即便血河老祖也不例外，即便他未曾展开自己的化神领域，但谁又曾想到堂堂血剑仙竟会输在你一个元婴修士手上！¤Even if the Blood Sword Palace was not good at defence, even Patriarch Blood River was no exception, even if he had not unfolded his Deity Transformation Domain, who would have thought that the titular Blood Sword Immortal would lose at the hands of a Nascent Soul cultivator like you!
而混元子虽然被剑气牢牢压制，却仍然大声嘲讽前者，唯恐其他战斗中的化神强者未曾留意你的胜利。¤And although firmly pinned down by the Sword Qi, Mixer still taunts the former loudly, lest the other fighting Deity Transformation powerhouses fail to notice your victory.
（留神，此人正在用神识试探你。）¤(Watch out, this person is tempting you with divine consciousness.)
你倒不妨进去看看，这剑阵乃是化神剑修所布置，要是能窥得一线，对你也有不小的好处。¤You might as well go in and take a look. This sword formation is set up by a Deity Transformation Sword Cultivator. If you can get a glimpse of it, it will be of great benefit to you.
我这里的任务例行维护底层阵法的，唯有内阁成员才能接取，你并不合适。¤My task here routinely maintains the bottom formation. Only cabinet members can take it. You are not suitable.
以你的阵道修为，还是不要丢人现眼了。¤With your cultivation base, don't be ashamed.
你是要前往底层吗？¤Are you going to the bottom?
唉，此事迟迟无人处理，就为阁下破例一次吧。¤Oh, this matter has been delayed, so let's make an exception for you.
对，我白帝楼底层是我白帝楼核心剑阵。¤Yes, the bottom of my Baidi Building is the core sword formation of my Baidi Building.
嗯，阵法是由白帝大人所布置，内置8座剑池用以供能，剑池内部会有灵材凝结，可以用来炼制飞剑。¤Well, the formation was arranged by Lord Baidi. There are 8 built-in sword ponds for energy. There will be condensed spiritual materials inside the sword ponds, which can be used to refine flying swords.
我没有500灵石....¤I don't have 500 spirit stones...
非我白帝楼内阁弟子弟子，需缴纳500灵石。¤If you are not a disciple of my Baidilou cabinet, you need to pay 500 spiritual stones.
不过，毕竟是我白帝楼核心阵法，此行就由我与阁下一同前往吧。¤However, after all, it is the core formation of my Baidi Tower. Let me and your Excellency go together on this trip.
说罢，你开始以几块砖石，排布起来。¤After all, you start to arrange a few bricks.
你？¤you?
哦？有些门道，一会我送你进入剑阵核心，入阵之后切记不要乱动，梳理好异常的灵力流动就回来复命。¤Oh? There are some doorways, I will send you into the core of the sword formation, remember not to move around after entering the formation, sort out the abnormal flow of spiritual energy and come back to resume your duties.
目前，没有什么事情。¤At present, nothing is going on.
剑阵？¤Sword formation?
我白帝楼底层阵法青龙剑阵最近法力流转不畅，需要阵道修为初窥门径的内阁成员前往例行维护。¤The formation of the Azure Dragon Sword Formation on the bottom of my Baidi Building has not been able to flow smoothly recently. It is necessary for members of the cabinet who are first to observe the doorway to perform routine maintenance.
底层？¤Bottom layer?
还没等你们说完，阁主的声音便传了过来。¤Before you could finish, the Pavilion Master's voice came over.
我说，{xiongdi}你也太厉害了吧，这等赛事，竟然一场都没输？¤I say, {xiongdi} you are also too powerful, this kind of tournament, but did not lose a single game?
别胡说，我没有！只是这么一比，我不就显得弱爆了吗？！¤Don't be ridiculous, I didn't! Just so compared, don't I look weak?!
我说，{xiongdi}你也太厉害了吧，这等赛事，竟然都打的有来有回？¤I said, {xiongdi} you are too powerful, right, this kind of tournament, but are fighting back and forth?
谁让你修炼的那么快？也只有在这种时候，我才会觉得我们的差距没有被拉开太多了……¤Who let you cultivate so fast? It is only at times like this that I feel that the gap between us has not been widened too much ......
也只是中等水平而已，谈不上多厉害。¤It's just a medium level, not much more impressive.
倪兄抬举了，在下只是遇到了些机缘巧合罢了，倪兄日后想必也能有此机缘吧。¤I just met some chance coincidentally, Ni brother will be able to have this chance in the future, I think.
嘿嘿，其实看到你在台上被暴揍的时候，我还是蛮开心的…¤Hey, hey, in fact, I was quite happy to see you on stage when you were beaten up...
不久后，随着最后一场比试结束，大会也在众人潮水般的喝彩声中，接近了尾声。而倪旭欣也趁此机会找到了你。¤Soon after, with the last competition ended, the conference also in the crowd tidal wave of applause, near the end. And Ni XuXin also took this opportunity to find you.
这个…{xiongdi}你也不必灰心…¤This...{xiongdi} you do not have to be discouraged...
倪兄，你口口声声说给我加油助威，原来心里还是盼着我输啊？¤Ni brother, you claim to cheer me, the original heart still expects me to lose ah?
你……¤You ......
你也太谦虚了吧，我以后要是能登上这擂台，至少都是一百年之后了。¤You are also too modest, I later if I can get on this ring, at least are a hundred years later.
我说，{xiongdi}你也太厉害了吧，这等赛事，竟然都没怎么输过？¤I say, {xiongdi} you are also too powerful, such events, but have not lost much?
由于你的弃权，之后所有的比试都被判定为负。¤Due to your abstention, all subsequent competitions were ruled negative.
你想，我们明明差不多大，你就能来参赛，这本身就很强了，我可连上场的机会都没有…¤You think, we are obviously about the same age, you can come to the competition, which in itself is very strong, I can not even have the opportunity to play...
倪兄抬举了，日后倪兄也必定能踏上这个擂台。¤Ni brother lifted, later Ni brother also will certainly be able to step on this ring.
在下龙宫长老，还未请教高姓大名？¤I am the Elder of the Dragon Palace, may I ask your name?
你为何会被纠缠上？¤Why are you being pestered?
我在此地探查九霄雷狱的所在。¤I am here to discover where the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison is located.
多谢{FirstName}道友救我。¤Thanks to {FirstName} Daoist for saving me.
唉...关于雷鸣海我就知道这么多了。¤Alas... That's all I know about the Thunder Sea.
九霄神雷乃是先天之雷，在其中引雷锻体，可以吸收先天之气精进体道。道友进入其中不断承受天雷就可吸收先天灵气。¤The Divine Thunder of the Nine Heavens is the lightning of the innate heavens, and by drawing lightning into it to forge your body, you can absorb the innate energy to refine your body dao. If you enter it, you will be able to absorb the innate spiritual energy.
多谢，{FirstName}道友出手相助。¤Thanks a lot, {FirstName}Daoist for helping out.
那这善后就由宗门弟子来吧，你我就先回去吧。¤Then this aftermath will be left to the disciples of the clan, and you and I will go back first.
嗯，看上去是玄骨要走了所以就都被...¤Well, it looks like Genbike is leaving so it's all been...
钟焰深吸一口气，平复了一下心情。¤Zhong Yan took a deep breath and calmed down a bit.
傻鸟和师傅也在等我们的消息。¤The silly bird and the master were also waiting to hear from us.
什么！！？？{vpunch=10,0.5}¤What!!!? {vpunch=10,0.5}
其中的豹麟兽已被屠戮殆尽？¤Where the leopard-liners have been slaughtered?
{shidi}，怎么了？¤{shidi}, what's wrong?
你眼前一黑，意识逐渐消散...¤Your eyes are dark, and your consciousness is gradually dissipating...
滚吧，此番就饶你一命。不过下次可就不一定了，哈哈哈哈哈。¤Go on, I'll spare you this time. But not necessarily next time, hahahahaha.
还请前辈高抬贵手，饶我一命！¤Senior, please raise your hands high and spare my life!
哈哈哈，有人花了{$lingshi}灵石买你的命，我也不过是收钱办事罢了。¤Hahaha, someone spent {$lingshi} spiritual stones to buy your life, and I was just collecting money to do things.
好...好险...¤Good...good risk...
在下不知何处得罪了前辈，前辈若有任何要求尽管提来，在下一定尽力满足！¤I don't know where to offend Senior. If Senior has any request, please mention it, I will try my best to satisfy it!
此人招式凌厉，出手皆是杀招。你一时之间难以抵挡，眼看就要殒命于此...¤This person has sharp moves, and all shots are ultimate moves. You can't resist it for a while, and you're going to die here...
你要能出得起这赏金，那我放你这一马也不是不行。¤If you can afford this bounty, then it's not impossible for me to let you go.

哈哈，宗门内的资源可不能用灵石换取，只有对宗门做出贡献的弟子才有资格在藏经阁与神兵阁兑换功法及法器，而这寒玉正是弟子们贡献度的体现。¤Haha, the resources in the sect cannot be exchanged for spirit stones. Only the disciples who have contributed to the sect are eligible to exchange exercises and artifacts in the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion and the Shenbing Pavilion, and this cold jade is the disciple.

道友，英杰会历来只允许炼气期的年轻修士参加，您还是请回吧。¤Fellow Daoist, the Yingjie Meeting has traditionally only allowed young cultivators of the Qi Refining Stage to participate, so you should please return.

道友，你的年龄已经超过40岁了，所以不能参赛。¤Friends, you are over 40 years old, so you can't participate.
道友，请在一旁稍等片刻，第一轮的比试就要开始了。¤Friends, please wait a while, the first round of competition is about to begin.
今年的比试真是精彩。¤This year's competition is really exciting.
来参加英杰会比试的修士，当然都是冲着筑基丹来的。当然，宁州的各大势力也都一直关注着每一届的英杰会比试，争夺那些表现最出色，最有潜力的青年才俊。¤The cultivators who come to participate in the Young Hero Tournament are all aiming for the Foundation Pills. Of course, the major factions in Ning Province always pay attention to every Young Hero Tournament, competing for those youths who have shown the greatest potential.
好好发挥，让我看看你这段时间修炼的成果怎么样！¤Play well, let me see how your cultivation results have been during this period of time!
可不？哪有那么容易，凡人之躯融合妖兽血脉本就是一个设想罢了。¤But no? It's not that easy. The fusion of a mortal body with the bloodline of a Spirit Beast is just a vision.
嘶，这半成品不是有问题吗，之前那蛊真人不就直接发狂力竭而亡了吗？¤Hiss, isn't there something wrong with this half-finished product, didn't that compulsive person just go crazy and die of exhaustion before?
嗯，没错以护法之能必然是没问题的。¤Well, yes with the ability of the Guardian there must be no problem.
嗯？炼妖散炼成了？听总坛的人说只是小有进展吧。¤Hmm? You've finished refining the Demon Pill? I heard from the people at the main altar that there was only a small progress, right?
只是门主大限将至，不得不博取这一线生机。¤It's just that the master of the gate is approaching his end and has to gamble for this chance of survival.
门主敢用必然是护法有了解决之法啊。¤Since the Sect Master dared to use it, It must be that the Guardians had a solution.
听我师父说，门主准备闭死关突破至化神。¤I heard from my master that the Sect Master is preparing to break through to the Deity Transformation in his deathly retreat.
唉，{FirstName}{shidi}，你的道心不稳啊......¤Hey, {FirstName}{shidi}, your Dao heart is unstable...
{FirstName}{shidi}果然厉害！¤{FirstName}{shidi} is really amazing!
刚刚比试的结果都已经出来了，那么第四轮比试，就由金虹剑派的{FirstName}{LastName}对阵星河剑派的白露。¤The results of the competition just now have come out, so in the fourth round of the competition, {FirstName}{LastName} of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect will face the Bailu of the Galaxy Sword Sect.
你与白露都是第一次参与宗门大比，就打入了决赛，台下众人议论纷纷...¤It was the first time that you and Bai Lu participated in the Zongmen Grand Competition, and they entered the finals, and everyone in the audience was talking...
{FirstName}{shixiong}，请...请指教。¤{FirstName}{shixiong}, please...please advise.
但其中并没有你的名字。¤But your name was not there.
待众人前去挑选完奖品后，天机阁阁主方才开口。¤After the crowd went forward and finished selecting their prizes, the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion Master only spoke.
唉，没能拔得头筹，着实可惜……¤Alas, it's a pity that I didn't get the top spot ......
只见他手一挥，天机榜上密密麻麻的字皆被抹掉，又以指为笔，在天机榜上凌空刻起一行行的字来。¤He saw his hand waving, the dense words on the list of heavenly machines were erased, and used his finger as a pen to carve lines of words in the air on the list of heavenly machines.
喧嚣声中，一切尘埃落定。你知道剩下的悲欢已与你无关，便转过身毅然踏上了旅程。¤In the noise, all the dust has settled. You know that the rest of the sorrow and joy is no longer relevant to you, so you turn around and resolutely embark on the journey.
不久后，随着最后一场比试结束，大会也在众人潮水般的喝彩声中，接近了尾声。¤Soon after, with the last competition ended, the conference also in the crowd tidal wave of applause, near the end.
而你的名字，赫然便在榜首！¤And your name is at the top of the list!
我宣布，本届大会圆满结束！¤I declare that this year's conference has come to a successful end!
{FirstName}道友此次位居榜首，按照规定，这些仙缘石与灵石便归道友所有了。¤{The first thing you need to do is to get ready.
胜负已分，本轮的胜者是{$TmpStrValue}！¤The winner of this round is {$TmpStrValue}!
最后也感谢诸位的努力，让大会得以顺利举行。希望在一百年后，范某依然能在此见到各位！¤Finally, I would also like to thank you all for your efforts, so that the conference can be held smoothly. I hope that in a hundred years, Fan will still be here to see you all!
呵呵，既然前十名已决出，这天机榜自然也要易位了。¤Oh, since the top ten have been decided, the Tianji list will naturally have to change places.
喧嚣声中，一切尘埃落定。你与倪旭欣道别过后，便转过身毅然踏上了旅程。¤The dust has settled amidst the noise. After you said goodbye to Ni XuXin, you turned around and resolutely embarked on your journey.
{FirstName}道友此次位列第{$mingci}，按照规定，这些仙缘石与灵石便归道友所有了。¤{FirstName}Daoist this time ranked the first {$mingci}, according to the rules, these immortal edge stones and spirit stones will belong to you.
而你的名字，赫然便在其中！¤And your name is clearly among them!
是…¤Yes…
胜负已分，本轮的胜者是{FirstName}{LastName}！¤The winner of this round is {FirstName}{LastName}!
唉……别说天机榜了，这排名估计连前二十都没…看来我的实力还是远远不够…¤Alas ...... not to mention the Tianji list, this ranking is estimated to be not even the top twenty...it seems that my strength is still far from enough...
{xiaozi}，你也别太过骄傲，就算这大会上没有你的对手，以后的路也还长着呢。切勿因为这点小成就，影响了自己的心境。¤{xiaozi}, don't be too proud, even if there are no opponents for you in this assembly, there is still a long road ahead. Don't let this small achievement affect your state of mind.
呵呵，既然所有事情均已办妥，大会也是时候宣告结束了。¤Oh, since everything has been done, it's time for the conference to be declared over.
你能分辨出，嘈杂的人海中有相当多人都在呼喊你的名字。只有在这一刻，你感觉到你站在了众生的顶点。¤You can discern that a considerable number of people in the noisy sea of people are calling out your name. Only at this moment do you feel that you are standing at the apex of all beings.
得了吧，能在榜上留下一笔还不知足？若实在想夺得榜首，还是得想办法进一步提升自己的实力。¤Come on, to leave a mark on the list is not enough? If you really want to win the top of the list, you still have to find a way to further improve your strength.
唉……连天机榜都上不了，看来我的实力还是不够……¤Alas ...... can't even get on the Heavenly Opportunity List, it seems my strength is still not enough ......
也只能这样想了…¤That's the only way to think about it...
上不了榜的人多着呢，这次名次还不错，应该能把本捞回来。当务之急还是得想办法提升自己的实力。¤There are many people who can't make it to the top of the list, and this time the ranking is not bad, so we should be able to get our money back. The most important thing is to find a way to improve your strength.
凡榜上有名之人，皆可于我阁藏宝楼以仙缘石兑换宝物。诸位这边请。¤All those who are on the list can exchange their treasures for Immortal Fate Stones at our Treasure House. This way, please.
也只能这样了…¤That's the only way...
{FirstName}道友此次位列第{$mingci}，按照规定，这些灵石便归道友所有了。¤The {FirstName}DaoYou this time ranked the first {$mingci}, according to the rules, these spiritual stones will be returned to you all.
要继续观看其它没有结束的比试么？¤Do you want to continue watching other competitions that are not finished?
别灰心，能来这参赛的必然都是各势力的佼佼者，只要你能合理运用功法神通，并勤加修炼，有朝一日一定也能像他们一样。¤Don't be discouraged, those who can come here to participate are definitely the best of the forces, as long as you can reasonably use the techniques and magic, and diligently cultivate, one day you will be able to be like them.
那白衣剑修嘴角抹过一丝笑意，竟挥剑向你刺来。¤A smile wipes across the corner of that white-clothed sword cultivator's mouth as he actually swings his sword at you.
好剑法！¤Good swordplay!
碧幽潭边，一名白衣剑修驱使着一柄灵剑上下翻飞，嘶嘶破风，划出一道道令人眼花缭乱的剑花。灵剑穿梭之下，漫天的竹叶纷崩，散落一地。¤At the edge of the pond, a white-clothed swordsman drove a spirit sword up and down, hissing and breaking the wind, cutting out a dazzling sword splash. As the sword flew, bamboo leaves were scattered all over the place.
你祭起法宝，便向他攻了过去。¤You raise your magic weapon and you attack him.
你松了一口气，紧绷的神经骤然放松，或许是因为方才的战斗太过耗神，你眼前一黑晕了过去。¤You breathed a sigh of relief, and your tight nerves suddenly relaxed, perhaps because the fight just now was too exhausting, and you fainted in darkness.
那魔修惨叫一声，化作一缕青烟消散了。而一旁连盛平岛主的元神也回归到自己的身体里，正调养生息。¤The evil cultivator screamed and it turned into a plume of blue smoke and dissipated. On the side, even the soul of Shengping Island Lord returned to his body, adjusting his vitality.
我们蓬莎岛的修士偶尔会需要陆生妖兽的材料炼制丹药法器，所以我们有时穿过无尽之海来到宁州寻求交易。¤Our cultivators on Pongsha Island occasionally need the materials of the terrestrial monsters to refine the magic pill, so we sometimes cross the endless sea to Ning Province to seek trade.
嘿嘿，道友若是有陆上的妖兽材料可以同我师兄交易一番，要知道海上可见不到这些东西呢。¤Hehe, if fellow Daoist has the monster material on land, he can trade with my senior, you must know that you can't see these things on the sea.
嘿嘿，前辈若是有陆上的妖兽材料可以同我师兄交易一番，要知道海上可见不到这些东西呢。¤Hey, if you have land-based monster materials, you can trade with my senior, you must know that you can't see these things on the sea.
好，很好。古神教蛊惑我派长老，本宫可未曾淡忘！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Good, very good. The Ancient God Sect tricked the elders of our sect, and we have not forgotten! {vpunch=10,0.5}
欸？这老头竟然...¤Hey? This old man is...
{$TmpTalkString}，帮我转告白帝，本宫会前往观礼。¤{$TmpTalkString}, tell the White Emperor for me that my palace will travel to observe the ceremony.
{FirstName}长老，你即已是宗门长老，按照惯例应当前往麟庙拜见麟尊大人。¤{FirstName}Elder, you are already an elder of the clan, so it is customary that you should go to the Lin Temple to pay your respects to Lord Lin.
晚辈{FirstName}{LastName}，前来拜见麟尊。¤I, {FirstName}{LastName}, have come to pay my respects to His Linsanity.
你抵达麟庙近前，大门便自动打开了。¤When you arrive close to the Lin Temple, the gate opens automatically.
请进。¤Please enter.
好的，我这就前去。¤Okay, I'm on my way.
{shixiong}若要炼丹，可以租借门派内的丹房使用。¤{shixiong} If you want to make alchemy, you can rent the alchemy room in the school.
{shidi}若要炼丹，可以租借门派内的丹房使用。¤{shidi} If you want to make alchemy, you can rent the alchemy room in the martial art.
这段时间御剑门的封印禁制似乎有所松动，我是奉宗门之命才来此勘察。¤During this time, Imperial Sword Sect's seal restrictions seem to have been loosened, and I was ordered by the sect to come here to investigate.
救命之恩难以为报，这些灵石与丹药还请道友收下。¤Saving grace is hard to repay, and these spirit stones and medicinal pills should be accepted by fellow daoists.
我来到遗迹不久以后，这里的剑灵似乎突然受到惊动。我不小心被几个剑灵发现，一路被追到了这里。¤Not long after I came to the ruins, the sword spirits here seemed to be suddenly alarmed. I was accidentally discovered by several sword spirits and was chased here all the way.
多谢道友出手相助。¤Thank you fellow daoists for your help.
没想到御剑门的遗迹如今发生了这么大的变动，我得尽快回到宗门禀告此事。¤Unexpectedly, the ruins of Imperial Sword Sect have undergone such a big change now. I have to return to the sect as soon as possible to report the matter.
呵呵，在下不才，在外游历多年学到了些秘术罢了，都是些小伎俩，上不了台面。¤I'm not talented, I've learned some secret techniques over the years, but they're just small tricks that don't make the grade.
呵呵呵呵，我只是长途奔波略有疲惫罢了，就不劳{FirstName}道友费心了。¤I'm just slightly tired from the long journey, so I don't need to bother {FirstName}Daoist friends.
呵呵呵呵，我只是长途奔波略有疲惫罢了，就不劳{FirstName}长老费心了。¤I'm just slightly tired from the long journey, so I don't need to bother {FirstName} the elders.
在下姓{FirstName}，途经此地，特意前来打个招呼罢了。¤This humble one is {FirstName}, I was passing through here and came to say hello.
虽然现在看来你的确并无大碍，但据我所知，离火门内好像并没有如此神奇的疗伤功法吧？¤Although it seems that you are indeed not seriously injured now, but as far as I know, there does not seem to be such a miraculous healing technique within the Heavenly Fire Gate, right?
只见他眉头微皱了一瞬，随即又变成一副笑眯眯的样子。¤He was seen to frown slightly for a moment, and then turned back into a smiling look.
那便只有得罪了。¤Then we have no choice but to be offended.
你的术法通玄，我自然是想讨教一二。¤Your art is so profound that I naturally want to learn a thing or two.
看来你这秘术短时间内也无法连续使用，否则又何必和我解释这些。¤It seems that you can't use this secret technique continuously for a short period of time, otherwise why bother explaining this to me.
此前你与那人交战被击中了要害，又马不停蹄奔波了这么久，这叫我如何放心的下？¤You were hit in the head in the battle with that man, and you've been on the move for so long, how can I rest easy?
尽管表面上依然和和气气，但你依稀看见，他脖子上有冷汗冒出。¤Although still outwardly conciliatory, you vaguely see a cold sweat break out on the back of his neck.
原来是{FirstName}长老，幸会幸会。敢问{FirstName}长老来此有何贵干？¤So it's {FirstName} Elder , it's a pleasure to meet you. May I ask what is the purpose of {FirstName}'s visit here?
我观你气息不稳，想必是遇到了什么变故，特来问候一二。¤I see that your breath is unstable, so I think you must have encountered some kind of change, and I came to say hello.
我要说不呢？¤And if I say no?
道友此言何意？¤What do you mean by this?
何人在此？！¤Who is here?
原来是{FirstName}道友，幸会幸会。敢问道友来此有何贵干？¤So it's {FirstName}Daoist friend, nice to meet you. May I ask what you are doing here?
他的笑容僵住，语气也阴沉了起来。¤His smile froze and his tone clouded over.
杨长老，别来无恙？¤Elder Yang, how are you doing?
不如将这秘术借我一阅，如何？¤How about lending me this secret technique?
约莫半个时辰过后，你跟着他来到了一处僻静之地。眼看已是动手的好时机，你便不再收敛气息。¤About half an hour later, you follow him to a secluded place. Seeing that it was a good time to make your move, you stopped collecting your breath.
你略施法术便把他们打得屁滚尿流，再也不敢上前造次，作鸟兽状飞速地跑远了。¤You just cast a spell and you beat them up, never daring to step forward and run away like a bird and beast.
你看着对面身着{color=#d0380a}玄道宗{/color}道袍的修士一头雾水，不知如何是好。¤You look at the cultivator wearing {color=#d0380a}Mystic Daozong{/color} robes on the opposite side, and you don't know what to do.
你等得有些不耐烦，打算闭眼小憩片刻。再睁眼时两只魔物都躺在了地上，你上前查看，发现它俩已气绝身亡。¤You waited a little impatiently, and planned to close your eyes and take a nap. When you opened your eyes, the two monsters were lying on the ground. You stepped up to check and found that they both died in anger.
莫非...此二人是被其他门派的弟子所杀？¤Could it be... these two were killed by disciples of other sects?
你不打算在这里浪费时间，便趁此机会赶紧离开了。¤You don't intend to waste time here, so take this opportunity and leave quickly.
此处有空间波动，先躲起来看看情况。¤There are spatial fluctuations here, so hide first to see the situation.
话不投机半句多，看剑！¤Don't talk too speculatively, look at the sword!
总之...幸好没有被发现，回头向白帝楼汇报吧。¤Anyway... Fortunately, I was not found. Let's report back to Baidilou.
空间缓缓撕裂出一条狭窄的缝隙，一名衣着奇特的修士迈步而出。¤The space slowly tore a narrow gap, and a cultivator in strange clothes stepped out.
你来不及过多思考，飞快地蹲在了距离最近的乱石堆中。¤You didn't have time to think too much, and quickly squatted in the nearest pile of rocks.
你四下翻弄，却并没有发现储物袋的踪迹，似乎已经被其它人给取走了。¤You rummaged around but found no trace of the storage bag. It seems that it has been taken away by someone else.
此地似乎刚刚才发生过一场大战，你向四周张望，只见附近的地面一片狼藉，两具尸首以极为古怪的姿势躺倒在地上...¤It seems that a great battle has just happened here. You look around and you see a mess on the ground nearby. Two corpses lie down on the ground in a very strange posture...
你暗自喟叹魏无极指望不上想再看一眼，却发现在你二人交谈之际他已离开此地了。¤You secretly sighed that Wei Wuji couldn't count on wanting to take another look, only to find that he had left here while you two were talking.
瞧着不太像宁州修士，老头，你对这身打扮有印象吗？¤Looking at the cultivator Ning Province, old man, do you have any impression of this outfit?
我怎么可能看上这点小钱！他才空口白牙诬赖清白人是贼！¤How could I take a fancy to this little money! He just blatantly accused Lai Qing that the white man was a thief!
救命啊！救命啊！{color=#d0380a}魔修{/color}杀人灭口啦！！¤Help! Help! {color=#d0380a}evil cultivator{/color} is killing people!!
两具尸体死状都极为惨烈，但从遍布全身的伤口来看，这并不像是寻常魔物所为，反倒像是被{color=#d0380a}法宝{/color}所伤。¤The deaths of the two corpses were extremely tragic, but judging from the wounds all over the body, it did not look like an ordinary monster had done it. Instead, it seemed to have been injured by a {color=#d0380a} magic weapon{/color}.
道友莫信这小贼恶意中伤，分明就是偷了我的储物袋被抓个现行还伶牙俐齿死不承认。¤The Taoist friend Mo believes that this little thief is maliciously slanderous. It is clear that he stole my storage bag and was caught. It is still clever and not admit it.
以不变应万变，你决定先弄清楚情况再考虑要不要帮忙。熟料不经意间脚下碎石迸裂，发出轻微的声响。¤In response to changes, you decide to figure out the situation first before considering whether to help. The clinker accidentally cracked under the gravel under your feet, making a slight noise.
不管此地到底发生了什么，一种危险的感觉涌上你的心头。你不敢逗留，飞快地离开了。¤Regardless of what happened here, a feeling of danger surged into your heart. You didn't dare to stay, and you left quickly.
熟悉的声音：俗话说井水不犯河水，我真就只是路过.....¤Familiar voice: As the saying goes, well water does not offend river water, I really just pass by...
{FirstName}兄！太好了你来了！我还以为今日就要交代在这魔门手中！{FirstName}兄千万小心，此魔修冒充玄道宗弟子不知有何阴谋。¤Brother {FirstName}! Great, you're here! I thought I was going to give an account today in the hands of this demon! {FirstName}, be careful, this evil cultivator pretends to be a disciple of Mystic Dao sect.
那些没有灵智的下等魔可不会拿走储物袋...莫非是有什么人在这天魔眼的试炼中{color=#d0380a}杀人夺宝{/color}？¤Those inferior demons who are not wise will not take the storage bag... Could it be that someone is {color=#d0380a} in the trial of this demon eye {color=#d0380a}killing people and winning treasures{/color}?
一颗尖锐的石头以破空之势和你打了个照面，你连忙闪身堪堪避过。¤A sharp stone hit you with the momentum of breaking through the air, and you rushed to avoid it.
定睛一看，被威胁的原来是先前遇到的离火门弟子。¤Looking intently, it turned out that it was the Heavenly Fire Gate disciple who was threatened before.
魔修？他刚才究竟看到了什么？¤Evil cultivator? What exactly did he see just now?
这两具尸体均已血肉模糊，四肢扭曲，难辨身份。此时你准备...？¤Both of the corpses are bloody, their limbs twisted, and their identities are difficult to distinguish. Are you ready to...?
这声音好像似曾相识...会是谁呢？¤This voice seems familiar...who would it be?
有点眼熟，好像在什么地方见过，但是怎么就想不起来呢？¤It's a bit familiar, as if I have seen it somewhere, but why can't I remember it?
总之...幸好没有被发现，在这天魔眼里多一事不如少一事，还是不参合这种闲事了。¤Anyway... Fortunately, it was not discovered. In the eyes of the devil, one thing is worse than one thing less, and it is still not participating in this kind of nosy.
定睛一看，被威胁的原来是先前遇到的竹山宗弟子。¤Looking intently, it turned out that it was the disciple of the Bamboo Mountain Sect who was threatened before.
你悄悄地摸过去，一个闪身躲进山石之后，想看清到底何人在争执。¤You touched it quietly, and after a dodge into the rock, you want to see who is arguing.
熟悉的声音：哎哎哎，你别过来！再过来我就喊人了啊！！¤Familiar voice: hey hey, don't come over! I'll call someone when I come back again!!
奇怪...能做到撕裂空间那至少也得有化神修为，难道是用了什么传送类的法宝？¤Strange... If you can rip through space, you must have at least a Deity Transformation cultivation, did you use some kind of teleportation magic?
且慢！道友有话好说，何须武力相向！¤Wait! Daoists have something to say, why use force to meet each other!
所谓事不关己，高高挂起。你不愿被莫名牵扯到这些危险中，于是扭头便离开了这里。¤The so-called matter has nothing to do with yourself, and hang up high. You don't want to be involved in these dangers inexplicably, so you turned your head and left here.
原来远处两只下等魔交战正酣，你方才是被余波牵连。它们似乎还没发现你的存在，你决定？¤It turns out that the two inferior demons in the distance are fighting, and you are just being implicated by the aftermath. They don't seem to have discovered your existence yet, you decide?
覆海大圣本就是修为精深的龙族大能，再加之九霄前辈的指点。此次突破必然如履平地。¤The Great Sage of the Overturning Sea is already a profoundly cultivated dragon powerhouse, plus the guidance of Senior Jiu Xiao. This breakthrough is bound to be as smooth as a walk in the park.
嗯，最近家父已经伤愈出关，正在着手冲击化神之境。¤Well, my father has recently recovered from his injuries and is in the process of reaching the Deity Transformation realm.
道友可还记得，家父突破失败一事？¤Do you still remember my father's failed breakthrough?
你是担心会有人趁虚而入？¤Are you worried that someone might take advantage of the situation?
本次突破不比上次，家父需借助龙珠引动龙脉之力故而会在龙宫突破，届时声势浩大，必会吸引这无尽之海上各方势力的目光。¤This breakthrough is different from the last one. My father needs to use the dragon pearl to trigger the power of the dragon veins, so he will make his breakthrough at the Dragon Palace, which will be so loud that it will attract the attention of all the powers on the Endless Sea.
此事也是我唐突了，道友不必挂怀。¤This is also a surprise to me, so there is no need for you to be upset.
浪方老贼已经被你手刃鲲族余孽已是不成气候，虽我龙族隐世不出，但也不是什么宵小之辈都可以觊觎的。¤The old thief Nang Fang has already been killed by you the remnants of the Kun tribe is no longer a threat. Although my dragon tribe is hidden from the world, it is not something that can be coveted by any small person.
此次仅是想邀请道友前来观礼而已。¤This time, I just want to invite you to come and observe the ceremony.
哈哈，并非如此。¤Haha, not so.
我龙族隐世不出，但也不是什么宵小之辈都可以觊觎的。¤My dragon clan is hidden from the world, but it is not something that can be coveted by any petty people.
此次是想请道友为家父护法。¤This time, I would like to ask you to guard my father.
不过鲲族余孽在浪方老贼的率领之下觊觎我族已久，他们必不会放过这次机会。¤However, the remnants of the Kun Clan, led by the old thief Longfang, have long coveted our clan, and they will not let go of this opportunity.
所以你确保不会被过路的妖兽邪修等偷袭后，简单地调整了自己的状态，而后便开始辅助炎萧调息疗伤。¤So you ensure that you will not be passing Spirit Beasts evil cultivators and other sneak attacks, simply adjust their state, and then began to assist Yan Xiao to regulate the healing.
也不知为何炎萧{$ChenHu}会在此遭遇天魔道的魔修。出动了三位元婴修士，还设下大阵，怎么看都不像偶遇。¤I don't know why Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} will encounter the evil cultivators of the Heavenly Demon Path here. Out of three YuanYing cultivators, but also set up a large formation, how to see not like a chance encounter.
所以你只是随意地用了些手段防止被妖兽邪修等偷袭，而后便自顾自的开始了修炼。¤So you just casually used some means to prevent sneak attacks by Spirit Beasts and evil cultivators, and then began to cultivate on their own.
所以你确保不会被过路的妖兽邪修等偷袭后，便开始为炎萧调息疗伤。¤So after you make sure that you will not be sneak attacked by passing Spirit Beasts evil cultivators and so on, you will start regulating and healing for Yan Xiao.
你简单为他处理后，便坐至一旁修炼起来，顺带为他护法。¤You quickly help him with it, then sit aside to cultivate, guarding for him at the same time.
炎萧的伤势稳定得很快，体内的灵气也近乎正常状态，但要说恢复，不是短时间内可以做到的。¤Yan Xiao's injuries stabilized quickly, and the aura in his body is near normal, but to say that recovery is not something that can be done in a short time.
七日后。¤Seven days later.
还好炎萧此前不知用了什么秘术，只是灵气透支得厉害，身上的伤看起来恐怖，却算不上实质性的伤害。以他元婴期的修为，即便是放着不管，自愈也只是时间问题。¤Fortunately, Yan Xiao did not know what secret techniques he had used previously, but his aura was so overdrawn that the injuries on his body looked horrible, but they were not substantial. With his YuanYing stage cultivation, even if left alone, self-healing is only a matter of time.
你带着晕过去的炎萧在雷鸣海上就近寻了一处落脚地。此处本就是一座不大的岛屿，除你和炎萧二人外，再无半点生灵。¤You took the fainting Yan Xiao in the Thunder Sea to find a landing place nearby. This is a small island, except for you and Yan Xiao, there are no more living beings.
你猜的没错...但我也不太清楚天魔道，为何会在海上追杀我...不但出动多位元婴修士...还布下如此阵法。¤You are right... But I'm not quite sure why the Heavenly Demon Path would be chasing me at sea... Not only did they send out a number of YuanYing cultivators... He also set up such a formation.
嗯，是极为精纯的灵核，而且此物由于与被封印的天魔息息相关，极为罕见，有些不凡的用处。但我也只是奉命行事，具体有何作用也不太清楚。¤Well, it is extremely pure spirit core, and this thing is extremely rare due to its close connection with the sealed heavenly demon, some extraordinary use. But I was only acting on orders, and I'm not too sure exactly what it does.
反倒像是特意在追杀，甚至是不知为何掌握了炎萧{$ChenHu}的行踪。¤Instead, it seems like a deliberate pursuit, even somehow mastered Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}'s whereabouts.
但你又怎忍心放着他不管？于是待炎萧体内灵气已趋于平稳，受的伤也无大碍后，你才放心的坐至一旁为他护法。¤But how can you bear to leave him alone? So when Yan Xiao's body aura has stabilized, and the injury is no longer critical, you sat aside to guard him without worry.
比赛当天，四十八位选手在决定完出场顺序后，便集中在一个选手休息室等待比赛的开始。¤On the day of the competition, the forty-eight contestants, after deciding on their order of appearance, gathered in a contestants' lounge to await the start of the competition.
各位，比赛马上就要开始了，若已经准备妥当，便可以前往比赛场地。¤Ladies and gentlemen, the competition is about to start, if you are ready, you can go to the competition venue.
所有比赛的赛程将统一公布在告示上，你们也可以在上面看到每位选手的目前得分情况。¤The schedules of all the competitions will be posted on the notices uniformly, and you can also see the current scores of each player on them.
比赛全程透明公开。诸位若还有什么疑问，都可以前来询问，在下必当不遗余力为各位解惑。¤The competition was transparent and open. If you have any questions, you can come and ask, and I will do my best to help you.
确实，这看来是这宝库的最后一道防线，只是不知为何没有攻击你。¤Indeed, this seems to be the last line of defense for this treasure trove, but for some reason it didn't attack you.
嗯....¤Alright...
在这空荡荡的密库之中，只有一旁的傀儡似乎在见证着龙族曾经的辉煌。¤In this empty secret vault, only the puppet on the side seems to be witnessing the once glory of the dragon race.
你看到一尊石人立于旁边，其中蕴含恐怖的能量，一股不弱于元婴期修士的威压扩散开朗。¤You see a stone man standing next to it, which contains terrifying energy, and a coercion that is not weaker than that of a cultivator in the Yuan Ying period spreads cheerfully.
在这空荡荡的密库之中，地面上破碎的傀儡诉说着曾经的辉煌。。¤In this empty secret vault, the broken puppets on the ground tell the glory of the past. .
一件内甲向你飞来。¤A piece of inner armor is flying towards you.
这好像是一具元婴期实力的傀儡。¤This seems to be a puppet with the strength of the Nascent Soul.
一道黑影向你扑来。¤A dark shadow is coming towards you.
你跟着他们一路逃遁，但很快就因为灵气风暴走散了。也不知过了多久，身后的吸力逐渐降低，你才终于逃过一劫。¤You followed them all the way to escape, but soon got separated by the aura storm. It is not known how long it took before the suction behind you gradually decreased and you finally escaped.
呼，终于逃出来了，没想到浪方大圣的吞噬神通竟恐怖如斯……还是先离开此地为好，免得节外生枝。¤Huh, I finally escaped. I didn't expect the devouring magical power of Langfang Dasheng to be so terrifying... It's better to leave this place first, so as to avoid unforeseen complications.
有意思，此等异象难得一见，我倒是要一探究竟！¤Interesting, such a vision is rare, but I want to find out!
你小心翼翼的朝那个方向前进，没过多久，只觉得远处传来的吸力越来越强，即便以你元婴期的实力也难以抵挡。¤You cautiously moved in that direction, and it didn't take long before you felt that the suction from the distance was getting stronger and stronger, even with your Nascent Soul's strength, it was hard to resist.
一声悠扬的鲸啸后，远处原本平静的海面掀起了巨浪。顷刻间，天地随之变色。¤After a melodious whale roar, the originally calm sea in the distance set off huge waves. In an instant, the world changed color.
回头只见方圆百里内，天地灵气被一扫而尽，无数海兽，没来得及逃跑的修士与船只被吸入一个巨大的漩涡，没有一个活物能够逃离...¤Looking back, I saw that within a radius of a hundred miles, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was swept away, countless sea beasts, cultivators and ships who had no time to escape were sucked into a huge vortex, and no living creature could escape...
你小心翼翼的朝那个方向前进，没过多久，只觉得远处传来的吸力越来越强，即便以你化神期的实力也难以抵挡。¤You cautiously moved in that direction, and it didn't take long for you to feel that the suction from the distance was getting stronger and stronger, even with your Deity Transformation Stage strength, it was hard to resist.
只见几名金丹期修士狼狈逃遁而来，就在他们身后，一股恐怖的吸引力在急速向你们蔓延而来...¤I saw a few Jindan stage cultivators fled in embarrassment, and just behind them, a terrifying attraction is rapidly spreading towards you...
你全力施展遁术，拼了命的往回逃。也不知过了多久，身后的吸力逐渐降低，你才终于逃过一截。¤You exerted all your strength to escape, and desperately fled back. I don't know how long it took, the suction behind you gradually decreased, and you finally escaped.
几位道友，请问那边究竟发生了何事？¤Fellow Daoists, may I ask what happened over there?
你心下大骇，但此时反悔已经为时已晚，你顺着各处被吸来的船只于妖兽一起，被卷入一片黑暗之中...¤You were terrified, but it was too late to regret it. You followed the ships that were sucked from all over the world, along with the monsters, and were involved in darkness...
你小心翼翼的朝那个方向前进，没过多久，只觉得远处传来的吸力越来越强，以你的修为根本难以抵挡。¤You cautiously moved in that direction, and after a while, you only felt that the suction from the distance was getting stronger and stronger, and it was impossible to resist with your cultivation base.
什么事也没有发生。¤Nothing happened.
你疯了？快，快退！¤Are you crazy? Fast, fast back!
道...道友有所不知，那是浪方大圣在吞噬天地灵气，若我们这等修为被波及到，那...那可是必死无疑啊！¤Dao... Fellow Daoists don't know, that is the great sage Langfang devouring the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. If our cultivation base is affected, then... it will definitely die!
如此天地异象，难道说……¤Such a vision of heaven and earth, could it be said...
道友也...也快逃离此地吧...再晚可...可就来不及了！¤Fellow Daoist... hurry up and escape from here... it's too late... it's too late!
倪旭欣拿着几张古旧的卷轴翻来覆去看得起劲儿，好像并没有注意到你的存在。¤Ni XuXin took a few old scrolls tossing around and looked energetically, as if he hadn't noticed your presence.
据族中长老说，宁州古迹中还残存着许多上古的宝物与传承，我费心搜罗好久，才得这几张古图。待进入古迹后若有缘相遇，我定与{$TmpTalkString}同享宝图，哈哈！¤According to the elders of the clan, there are still many ancient treasures and inheritances remaining in the Ning Province monuments, and it took me a long time to search through them to get these ancient maps. If we meet after entering the monument, I will share the treasure maps with {$TmpTalkString}, haha!
若是难敌林家修士，不妨来我这里看看。¤If it's hard to beat the Lin family Cultivator , you might as well come and have a look.
道友，这秘市也算是武陵城一年一次的盛会了，可不要空手而归啊。¤Friends of Taoism, this secret city can be regarded as the once-a-year event in Wuling City, don't go home empty-handed.
你又沿着这个方向用神识仔细探测了一番，可惜并没有其它的发现。¤You took a closer look in this direction with your divine consciousness, but unfortunately there was no other discovery.
岩壁上一道奇异的光泽引起了你的注意...原来是一颗{SayStcVal=948}。¤A strange luster on the rock wall caught your attention... It turned out to be a {SayStcVal=948}.
这广陵城附近有点名气的散修都被他给打了个遍，若不是忌惮百里府的势力，这小少爷恐怕得结下不少仇怨。¤Famous independent cultivators near Guangling City has all been beaten up by him. If it were not for fear of the forces of Baili Mansion, this young master might have a lot of hatred.
传闻这百里少爷醉心武艺，遇见年龄或是修为相仿的修士便一定要拉着比上一比。¤It is rumored that this young master of Baili is fascinated by martial arts, and when he meets a cultivator of similar age or cultivation level, he must compare himself with the previous one.
这块刻板上记录的内容确实有一定的研究价值...¤The content recorded on this stereotype does have some research value...
虽然是赝品，不过用作摆设和收藏倒也不错。我们采筠阁里其实有不少修士喜欢收集这类型的东西呢。¤Although it is a fake, it is not bad for decoration and collection. In fact, many cultivators in our Caijun Pavilion like to collect this type of things.
咳咳...其实这应该只是一种特殊的天象，唤作月环食。这种天象极少出现，我猜十有八九，便是那古人将月环食当作了妖兽，才刻下了此碑。¤Ahem... In fact, this should just be a special celestial phenomenon called an annular lunar eclipse. This kind of celestial phenomenon rarely appears, I guess nine times out of ten, it was the ancients who regarded the lunar eclipse as a monster and carved this monument.
太阴幽荧？¤Lunar shadow?
可如此说来，那灵气涌动的异象又作何解释？¤But in this way, what is the explanation for the vision of the surging spiritual energy?
一般来说，这种铭刻了灵纹的石碑，往往是龙族所布阵法之阵基。这东西定然不会是从化龙海龙宫所得，那想必应该是上古龙宫的遗物吧。¤Generally speaking, this kind of stone tablet inscribed with spiritual patterns is often the formation base of the dragon clan. This thing will definitely not be obtained from the Dragon Transformation Sea Dragon Palace, it must be the relic of the Ancient Dragon Palace.
这是上古时期发生在极阴三海上的一件奇事。¤This is a strange thing that happened in the Three Seas of Extreme Yin in ancient times.
大战持续了几个月，最后鲲鹏耐不住了，集全身灵力向玄武攻去。而玄武则整面龟壳亮起，化作了一个防御大阵，硬是扛住了这一击。¤The war lasted for several months, and finally Kunpeng couldn't bear it any longer, and concentrated all his spiritual power to attack Black Tortoise. On the other hand, Black Tortoise's entire tortoise shell lit up and turned into a great defensive formation, which just resisted the blow.
再细细感知之下，这块石头的内部不仅没有任何灵气残留，连一点其它的杂质都没有。如此纯净，恐怕不是天然所能形成。¤Under careful perception, there is not only no spiritual energy left inside this stone, but also no other impurities. So pure, I am afraid it cannot be formed by nature.
{$daoyou}能否告知，你是在何处发现的这块鳞片？¤Can {$daoyou} tell where you found this scale?
无尽海渊...是了，我早该想到...¤Endless Abyss... Yes, I should have thought...
嗯...是古代文字...让我看看上面都刻了些什么...¤hmm... it's an ancient script... let me see what's engraved on it...
嗯…一块古老的旋龟壳，上面写的这种文字相当特殊，是图文合一的一种记叙方式。让我看看上面写了些什么东西…¤Um... an ancient tortoise shell, this kind of text written on it is quite special, it is a way of narrating the combination of pictures and texts. Let me see what's written on it...
确实…龟壳上还记录了与之有关的一些传言。例如他曾经在一个村子的周围出现，第二天村民们发现，庙宇里祭祀用的黑色酒杯竟赫然变成了白色……¤Indeed... There are also some rumors about it recorded on the turtle shell. For example, he once appeared around a village. The next day, the villagers found that the black wine cup used for sacrifice in the temple had turned white...
哈哈哈…这看上去像矿石，但其实是某些妖兽的角质...也就是...俗称指甲一类的东西。¤Hahaha... It looks like ore, but it's actually the horn of some monsters... that is... commonly known as nails or something.
上古龙宫的遗物，这些年来陆陆续续我也收到过不少，不过像这样的石碑确实是第一次见，算得上珍稀之物。¤I have received a lot of relics from the Ancient Dragon Palace over the years, but a stone tablet like this is indeed the first time I have seen it, and it can be regarded as a rare thing.
不过，大部分都是残损的...能够保存这么完整的还是比较罕见。¤However, most of them are mutilated...and it is rare to find such intact ones.
总之，不管有关玄武的传说是真是假，古代人类为神兽举办葬礼的习俗是确有其事，之前也曾有其它的石棺出世。¤In short, no matter whether the legend about Black Tortoise is true or not, the custom of ancient human beings holding funerals for divine beasts is true, and other sarcophagi have been born before.
赝品？那人可信誓旦旦的说这里面保存的可是上古神兽鲲鹏的羽毛！¤Fake? That person can be trusted to say that the feathers of the ancient beast Kunpeng are preserved here!
当时的人类无法解释如此规模的天地异象，所以人们将那枚银色圆环奉为圣兽，取名为“太阴幽荧”。¤Humans at that time could not explain such a large-scale vision of heaven and earth, so people regarded the silver ring as a holy beast and named it Taiyin Youying.
极阴三海中许多地方都有人声称，自己目睹过诡异的黑色人影——他通体漆黑，连眼睛都完全是黑色，远看像是一道影子，但又的确是人形。¤In many places in the Three Seas of Extreme Yin, there are people who claim that they have witnessed a strange black figure - his entire body is pitch black, even his eyes are completely black, and it looks like a shadow from a distance, but it is indeed a human shape.
阴冥海...原来如此...¤The Deep Yin Sea... so it is...
如果我没有猜错的话，这应该是远古神兽玄武的龟壳碎片。¤If I guessed correctly, this should be the tortoise shell fragment of the ancient mythical beast Black Tortoise.
{$daoyou}能否告知，你是在何处发现的这块角质？¤Can {$daoyou} tell us where you found this piece of keratin?
嗯,,,我曾经见过这种柱子。它有古代龙宫建筑的典型特征，偶尔能在东海上浮的龙宫残骸中找到。¤Well,,, I have seen this kind of pillars before. It has typical features of Ancient Dragon Palace architecture and can occasionally be found among the wreckage of dragon palaces floating in the East China Sea.
蛇死后，那些崇拜玄武的古代人类便将一部分掉落的蛇鳞收集起来，为它举办了葬礼。那巨大的石棺想必就是为玄武准备的。¤After the snake died, those ancient humans who worshiped basalt collected some of the fallen snake scales and held a funeral for it. That huge sarcophagus must have been prepared for Black Tortoise.
话说回来，这本来也只是记录在石碑上的文字，真实性还是有待考究的，说不定只是古人的想象罢了。¤Having said that, this was originally only the words recorded on the stone tablet, and the authenticity still needs to be investigated, maybe it is just the imagination of the ancients.
这样的遗物确实非常珍贵，对于研究阵法的历史也有很高的价值。¤Such relics are indeed very precious, and they are also of high value for studying the history of the formation.
嗯？这是真龙精血结晶？¤Ok? Is this the crystal of true dragon essence?
这块石头是我在阴冥海的一处海岛上寻得的，我这么说，道友应当理解它的奇怪之处了吧。¤I found this stone on an island in the Deep Yin Sea. I said so, fellow Daoists should understand the strangeness of it.
据说上古神兽玄武乃龟蛇之身，但龟体与蛇体其实并非一体，而是一种共生的关系。由于龟的寿元比蛇要长的多，在蛇寿元将近之时，便主动离开了龟。¤It is said that the ancient mythical beast Black Tortoise is the body of a turtle and snake, but the turtle body and the snake body are not actually one body, but a symbiotic relationship. Since the turtle's lifespan is much longer than that of the snake, when the snake's lifespan was approaching, he took the initiative to leave the turtle.
不过这鳞片的实物我还是第一次见到，倒是颇具研究价值。¤However, this is the first time I have seen the scales in kind, and it is quite valuable for research.
极阴三海的情报，即便在我们采筠阁内部也比较少见。这块石头倒也有一些值得研究的价值...¤The information on the three seas of extreme yin is relatively rare even in our Caijun Pavilion. This stone does have some value to study...
有趣，竟然记录了上古时期的一场惊动整片无尽之海的天地异象。¤Interestingly, it actually recorded a vision of heaven and earth that shocked the entire endless sea in ancient times.
不过，这赝品也算的上是质量极为上乘的高仿品了，道友平日里对这些东西研究的少，被骗倒也不奇怪。¤However, this fake product is also considered a high-quality imitation product. Daoist friends do not study these things very little on weekdays, so it is not surprising to be deceived.
嗯...乍看之下倒是没什么特别的。不过想来，道友也不至于拿一快普通的石头来消遣于我吧？¤Hmm...at first glance nothing special. But come to think of it, fellow Daoist wouldn't take a few ordinary stones to entertain me, right?
不过即便如此，这块石碑上记录的内容对上古的历史也相当具有研究价值。¤But even so, the content recorded on this stele is of considerable research value for ancient history.
听这描述，倒与天地间诞生的某些灵物有几分相似。¤Listening to this description, it is somewhat similar to some spiritual creatures born between heaven and earth.
啧啧，可惜这种晶体中的能量似乎只有鲲族能够吸收，对于人类修士而言只能算是一种收藏品而已。¤Tsk tsk, unfortunately, the energy in this crystal seems to be only absorbed by the Kun clan, and it can only be regarded as a collection for human cultivators.
远古时期，某一天的入夜时分，曾有一枚中空的银色圆环悬挂在远空中，整片无尽之海很快便充满了阴气。灵气也变得异常躁动，向无尽之海深处涌去。这异象足足持续了一整晚，直到第二天天亮才消失。¤In ancient times, at nightfall one day, there was a hollow silver ring hanging in the sky, and the entire endless sea was soon filled with yin energy. The aura also became extremely restless, rushing into the depths of the endless sea. This vision lasted for a full night, and did not disappear until dawn the next day.
曾有一人在好奇心驱使下接近过那黑色人影——他先用神识探查了一番，发现神识压根探测不到他体内。后又试图与他交流，发现他发音虽然奇怪，但确实能够口吐人言。¤Someone once approached the black figure driven by curiosity-he first probed with his soul sense and found that soul sense could not detect his body at all. Later, I tried to communicate with him and found that although his pronunciation was strange, he was indeed able to speak human words.
以及还有阴气极重的妖怪在祸害村庄的时候，碰巧遇见了那黑色人影路过，那些妖怪看见他像看见鬼一样逃了的传言。¤And there are also rumors that when the monsters with a lot of yin qi were harming the village, they happened to meet the black figure passing by, and the monsters saw him and fled like a ghost.
究竟为何会产生这种石头？¤Why is this stone produced?
不错，这是我在东海找到的。¤Yes, this is what I found in Donghai.
哈哈哈，若真是神兽鲲鹏的羽毛，还是保存的这么完整的，至少也得价值百万，哪会随随便便拿出来转手。¤Hahaha, if it is the feather of the divine beast Kunpeng, it is still preserved so completely, at least it must be worth a million, and it will be taken out casually and changed hands.
极阴三海位于无尽之海的极南之地，这几片海域中的任何物体都毫无疑问会沾染上那里的阴气，这块石头却完全没有，这便有几分奇怪了。¤The three extreme yin seas are located in the extreme south of the endless sea. Any object in these sea areas will undoubtedly be contaminated with the yin qi there, but this stone is completely absent, which is a bit strange.
嗯...其实是在一处破败的祭坛之中。我原本以为它会是什么更有价值的东西呢...¤Well... it's actually in a dilapidated altar. I thought it would be something more valuable...
这些实验结果的有关记录我倒是很感兴趣，可惜实在缺损的太严重了。¤I am very interested in the relevant records of these experimental results, but unfortunately the defects are too serious.
{$daoyou}能否告知，你是在何处发现的这块碎壳？¤{Can you tell me where you found this broken shell?
哈哈哈哈，这根本就不是什么琥珀，只是一个仿制品而已嘛。{$daoyou}这是从哪里淘来的赝品？¤It's not even amber, it's just an imitation. {Where did you get this fake from?
世有异兽，名曰鲲鹏，翔九霄而为鹏，潜九渊而为鲲。又有蛇龟，名唤玄武，二者斗于...¤There is a strange beast in the world, the name is Kunpeng, it soars into the sky to become a Peng, and it dives into the nine abyss to become a Kun. There are also snakes and turtles, named Black Tortoise, and the two fight...
嗯...这似乎是什么妖兽身上碎裂的硬壳。让我看看...嗯？这熟悉的灵纹...¤Hmm... This seems to be the cracked hard shell of some monster. Let me see... eh? This familiar spirit pattern...
鲲鹏既能飞又能游，攻势连绵不绝，但玄武本身就是蛇龟两位一体，面对鲲鹏倒也不落下风。¤Kunpeng can both fly and swim, and the offensive is continuous, but Black Tortoise itself is two snakes and turtles, and he is not at a disadvantage when facing Kunpeng.
是在无尽海渊，这块碎壳有何特殊之处？¤It is in the endless sea, what is so special about this broken shell?
原来如此，那这就很有可能是古代神兽掉落的爪尖碎片了。¤It turns out that this is very likely to be a fragment of the claw tip dropped by the ancient beast.
除了坚硬以外，没有什么特别的地方...也不适合用来炼器...不过...这片也未免太硬了吧！¤Apart from being hard, there is nothing special about it...and it is not suitable for refining...but...this piece is too hard!
极阴三海，特别是玄冥海附近常有邪修出没，拥有一些稀奇古怪的功法倒也正常。¤The three Deep Seas of extreme yin, especially near the Deep Black Sea, are often haunted by evil cultivators, and it is normal to have some strange exercises.
唔...好大的蛇鳞...我还从未在鲲族之外的其它海兽身上见到过这么大的鳞片。¤Hmm...what a big snake scale...I have never seen such a large scale on other sea beasts outside the Kun clan.
而最诡异的是，待他走近后才发现，那黑色人影的相貌居然与自己一模一样。那人见情况不妙，便当即逃走了。¤And the weirdest thing was that when he approached, he realized that the black figure's appearance was exactly the same as his own. Seeing that the situation was not good, the man ran away immediately.
{$daoyou}是想交换情报，还是发现了什么有趣的遗物？¤Did {$daoyou} want to exchange information, or did you find any interesting relics?
虽然我还不太能确定它具体的来历，不过确实有一定的研究价值。¤Although I am not quite sure of its specific origin, it does have certain research value.
上古神兽血脉...还有鲲族的吞噬秘术...竟想领悟神兽传承的神通么？实在可笑...¤The blood of the ancient beasts...and the secret art of devouring the Kun people...do you want to understand the magical powers inherited by the beasts? It's ridiculous...
在一个巨大的石棺之中，这石棺有数十丈宽，巨大无比。¤In a huge sarcophagus, this sarcophagus is dozens of feet wide and extremely huge.
有趣，这块刻板上显然是记录了远古时鲲鹏与玄武在无尽海渊发生的那场大战。¤Interestingly, this stereotype apparently recorded the battle between Kunpeng and Black Tortoise in the endless abyss in ancient times.
石棺...这倒让我想起一个传说。¤Sarcophagus... This reminds me of a legend.
其中缘由我也不太清楚…不过据我猜测，这和我们平日里使用的灵石有几分相似。当灵石中的灵气被吸收殆尽后，也会形成这样类似的状态。¤I don't know the reason for it... But according to my guess, this is somewhat similar to the spirit stones we use on weekdays. When the spiritual energy in the spiritual stone is completely absorbed, it will form a similar state.
这可是相当稀有的东西，鲲族在吞噬龙族后，能够将龙族的精血提炼并吸收。只有提炼到一半，还没有完全吸收的情况下，才会形成这样的红色晶体。¤This is quite a rare thing. After the Kun clan devoured the dragon clan, they were able to extract and absorb the blood of the dragon clan. Such red crystals will only be formed when it is half-refined and not fully absorbed.
嗯...残缺的玉简...让我看看里面还有多少有价值的内容...¤Hmm... a broken jade slip... let me see how much valuable content there is...
这个…我也不太确定...或许只是由于特殊的天象导致阴阳失衡，产生的某种现象吧...¤This... I'm not quite sure... Maybe it's just some kind of phenomenon caused by the imbalance of Yin and Yang caused by a special astronomical phenomenon...
像玄武，鲲鹏这些古代神兽，不仅实力强大而且好斗，自然会成为远古人类心中类似图腾一般的存在，并用它们的材料举行祭祀仪式。¤Ancient mythical beasts like Black Tortoise and Kunpeng are not only powerful but also aggressive, they will naturally become totem-like existences in the hearts of ancient human beings, and use their materials to hold sacrificial ceremonies.
一块石碑...从造型上来看，这似乎是龙族的东西，不过上面铭刻的灵纹我确实没有见过...¤A stone tablet... From the perspective of shape, it seems to be something of the dragon family, but I have never seen the spirit pattern engraved on it...
不错，这龟壳上的奇事我之前倒是闻所未闻，很有研究的价值。¤Yes, I have never heard of this strange thing on the tortoise shell before, and it is worth studying.
{$daoyou}是想用它换取灵石，还是其它海域的情报？¤Does {$daoyou} want to trade it for spirit stones, or information about other seas?
嗯…是上古文字，让我看看上面写了些什么…¤Well... it's an ancient script, let me see what's written on it...
{FirstName}{xiongdi}可有打听到什么有关天蝉灵叶的消息？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} have you heard anything about the Skyscada Leaf?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，近来无恙？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, all right?
我送阁下。¤I will send it to you.
前辈好。¤Hello, senior.
他前来迎接你。¤He came to greet you.
嗯？有人入侵？¤Huh? Someone invaded?
你遇到了宗门驻守此地的{SayStcVal=931}。¤You met {SayStcVal=931} who was stationed here by the sect.
对方和你点头示意。¤The other party nodded with you.
{xiaozi}，迷路了？¤{xiaozi}, lost?
要前往执事堂吗？¤Are you going to the Deacon Hall?
前方是{SayStcVal=928}驻守此地的{SayStcVal=931}，你决定...¤Ahead is {SayStcVal=928} stationed here {SayStcVal=931}, you decide...
门派变量错误¤Wrong martial art variable
后方乃门派驻地，办完事速速离开。¤The rear is the resident's resident, and leave as soon as you finish the matter.
阁下这里是我{SayStcVal=X}重地，劝你速速离去。¤Your Excellency, this is my {SayStcVal=X} place. I advise you to leave as soon as possible.
你二人又闲聊一会无关紧要的修炼杂事后，才各自离去。¤The two of you chatted for a while about unimportant cultivation chores before leaving each other.
那我便不客气了。¤Then I'm welcome.
他见你终于是停下手来，竟忘了刚才的低声下气，话语声又硬气了起来。¤When he saw that you finally stopped, he forgot the low voice just now, and his voice became hard again.
你还有什么想说的？¤What else do you want to say?
我后来上前询问他几句，这人竟然还对我恶语相向。若不是前段时间出了些事，如今有伤未愈，我当场就跟他“切磋切磋”论论斤两了。¤I went up to him and asked him a few words later, but the man even spoke ill of me. If it hadn't happened some time ago, and now the injury is still not healed, I would have discussed with him on the spot.
你向{$NpcName}述说星宫修士被你教训的惨状，而下意识地忽视了他的“借口”。¤You told {$NpcName} about the tragic situation that the Star Palace cultivator was taught by you, and subconsciously ignored his excuse.
咳，实不相瞒，{$ZaiXia}的好友正是星河剑派门人。最近也是她与我提起此事，才令我有些担忧 。¤Well, to be honest, {$ZaiXia}'s friend is a disciple of the Galaxy Sword Sect. It was she who brought this up to me recently that made me a little worried.
但...{$ZaiXia}还是有些担心。¤But...{$ZaiXia} is still a little worried.
{$ZaiXia}先谢过{FirstName}{$NickName}了。¤{$ZaiXia} would like to thank {FirstName}{$NickName} in advance.
唉，也罢，我这就离开。¤Oh, well, I'm leaving now.
若不是{$NpcName}说你在这附近滞留太久，让星河剑派的女性修士有些担忧，还托我前来询问情况，我可没兴趣管你星宫的人想做什么。¤If it wasn't for the fact that {$NpcName} said that you had been around here for too long, the female cultivators of the Galaxy Sword Sect were a little worried, and asked me to come to inquire about the situation, I wouldn't be interested in what the people in your star palace want to do.
这是说好的报酬，还请收下。¤This is the promised reward, please accept it.
这是说好的报酬，还请笑纳。¤This is the promised reward, please accept it with a smile.
那人便在星河剑派往青石灵脉的支路上，就交给{FirstName}{$NickName}了。¤That person then handed it over to {FirstName}{$NickName} on the branch route of the Xinghe Sword to the Bluestone Spirit Vessel.
此处既不是门派领地，又不是你私人所有，凭什么赶我离开？¤This place is neither the sect's territory nor your private property, why did you make me leave?
{FirstName}{$NickName}可有找到那星宫弟子？¤Did {FirstName}{$NickName} find that Star Palace disciple?
这是说好的报酬，不用跟我客气，{$Xiao}¤This is the promised reward, don't be polite to me, {$Xiao}
你将星宫修士的辩解转述给{$NpcName}。¤You relay the Star Palace friar's defense to {$NpcName}.
呵，可不只是我，只怕宁州五行宗门对你们星宫修士都有些看法。¤Oh, it's not just me, I'm afraid that the Five Elements Sect of Ning Province has some opinions on your Star Palace cultivators.
呵，你们星宫的男修不都这样？¤Oh, aren't all male cultivators in your star palace like this?
（虽说是有事找我，但他也是盛情相待在先，该帮这个忙么？）¤(Although he is looking for me for something, he is also kind to me first, should I help?)
怕你不成？¤Afraid that you will fail?
所以若是{FirstName}{$NickName}能帮{$ZaiXia}提点提点这星宫弟子，感激不尽。¤Therefore, if {FirstName}{$NickName} can help {$ZaiXia} to remind this star palace disciple, I would be very grateful.
算了，回去复命吧。¤Forget it, go back to life.
等我消息吧。¤Wait for my news.
不用客气，我对星宫的男性修士也没什么好感。¤You're welcome, I don't like the male cultivators in the Star Palace either.
{$NpcName}闻言只是爽朗地两声大笑，似乎是早就知道你会这么问。¤{$NpcName} just laughed heartily when he heard this, as if he knew you would ask this.
话说回来，近期我发现有一星宫男性长老时常于星河剑派外滞留，也不知是为何。¤Having said that, I recently discovered that there is a male elder from the Xinghe Palace who often stays outside the Xinghe Sword Sect, and I don't know why.
当然不是，此事说来话长，但告诉你也无妨。¤Of course not, it's a long story, but it's okay to tell you.
说的好听，还不是一见到星宫的男性修士就满脸厌恶。¤It's nice to say, but it's not that the male cultivator in the star palace is full of disgust.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，好久不见，近来可好？¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, long time no see, how are you doing?
只是因为他待在星河剑派附近么？¤Is it just because he stayed near the Galaxy Sword Sect?
可惜这星宫的男修士虽令人厌恶，但也不能归于魔教一类，不然哪用这么麻烦。¤It's a pity that the male cultivators in this star palace are disgusting, but they can't be classified as demon sects, otherwise it would be so troublesome.
且慢，若是叙旧只怕不会有这么大排场，{$NpcName}不如说在前头。¤Wait a minute, I'm afraid it won't be so pompous if it's a reminiscence, {$NpcName} might as well be in the front.
{$NickName}今日找我来怕不只是叙旧罢？¤{$NickName} came to see me today, I'm afraid it's not just a reminiscence?
举手之劳而已。¤Just a little effort.
推杯换盏之间，你见他突然提起此事，心想正事要来了。但表面上还是装作不知，仅是随口应付。¤Between pushing the cups and changing the cups, you see him suddenly mentioning this, thinking that business is coming. But on the surface, he still pretended not to know, and just dealt with it casually.
那星宫修士便在星河剑派往青石灵脉的支路上，{FirstName}{$NickName}多加小心。¤That Star Palace cultivator sent {FirstName}{$NickName} to be more careful on the branch road sent by the Galaxy Sword to the Bluestone Spirit Vessel.
既是如此，那我另想他法好了。¤If that's the case, then I'll think otherwise.
料想也是，强如{FirstName}{$NickName}又怎会有烦恼呢，哈哈。¤As expected, as strong as {FirstName}{$NickName}, how can there be trouble, haha.
出于星宫男性修士的名声考量，任其长期停留在星河剑派附近确实影响不太好，但他也确实未做什么出格的事情，星河门人碍于门派关系也不方便直接出手驱离他。¤Considering the reputation of the male cultivator of the Star Palace, it is not good for him to stay near the Xinghe Sword Sect for a long time, but he did not do anything out of the ordinary. .
要找{$NickName}帮忙的事嘛，确实有，但于{$NickName}的实力而言，只是件不足挂齿的小事。相比与{$NickName}叙旧饮酒而言，自当是不在话下。¤There is indeed a need to ask {$NickName} for help, but in terms of {$NickName}'s strength, it's just a trivial matter. Compared to reminiscing about drinking with {$NickName}, it's a no-brainer.
前些年我花重金托人为我寻觅炼心芝。没想到他居然告诉我在星河剑派西方接近衡州处有炼心芝的消息，若不是此人与我合作多次，颇有信誉，我是不会相信这个消息的。¤A few years ago, I spent a lot of money to ask someone to find Xinzhi for me. I didn't expect that he would actually tell me that there was news about refining Xinzhi in the west of the Galaxy Sword Sect near Hengzhou. If it wasn't for this person who has cooperated with me many times and is quite reputable, I would not have believed this news.
作为修士，估摸着只是在寻觅仙缘罢。¤As a cultivator, it is estimated that he is just looking for immortal fate.
确实如此。¤It does.
你别血口喷人！我只是有私事要办而已！可不会用神识探查星河剑派！¤Don't spit your blood! I just have personal business to do! He wouldn't use his soul sense to investigate the Galaxy Sword Sect!
席间，你二人交流了一番修炼感悟、对修仙界的看法以及一些其他的烦扰杂事，倒也称得上是聊得尽兴。¤During the banquet, the two of you exchanged some thoughts on your cultivation, your views on the world of immortality, and some other troublesome chores.
很简单，帮我揍他一顿，然后赶他离开就好。¤It's very simple, just beat him up for me and then drive him away.
你来到星河剑派左近，果然有一星宫修士于此不知用神识在探查着什么，一副聚精会神的样子，甚至没有留意你的到来。¤When you came to the vicinity of the Xinghe Sword Sect, there was indeed a Xinggong cultivator who didn't know what to do with his spiritual sense. He looked attentively and didn't even notice your arrival.
星宫修士我也有接触过，却没有{$NickName}说的那般不堪。¤I also have contact with the Star Palace cultivator, but it is not as bad as {$NickName} said.
在下所述皆是实情。¤The following is true.
{size=24}这么多天都没找到，估计是没希望了，不如就此离开吧，省得看这帮伪君子的脸色。{/size}¤{size=24}I haven't found it for so many days, I guess it's hopeless, so let's just leave, so as not to see the faces of these hypocrites. {/size}
那星宫男性修士便在星河剑派前往青石灵脉的支路上，还请{FirstName}{$NickName}尽快前往。¤The male cultivator of the Star Palace was on the branch road of the Xinghe Sword Sect to the Qingshi Lingmai, and he also asked {FirstName}{$NickName} to go there as soon as possible.
哎哟，都叫你等等了啊，真疼。¤Ouch, I've been told you to wait, it hurts.
你本只想心平气和的询问一番，但这星宫修士不知为何态度竟如此恶劣。回想起多年前在林府遇到的那个星宫弟子，让你更是气不打一处来。¤You just wanted to ask calmly, but this Star Palace cultivator has such a bad attitude for some reason. Recalling the Xinggong disciple you met in the Lin Mansion many years ago makes you even more angry.
{$NpcName}脸上一喜，但很快便掩盖下去，一副什么都没发生的样子。¤{$NpcName} had a smile on his face, but quickly covered it up, as if nothing had happened.
嗯，我先去问问情况吧。¤Well, let me ask the situation first.
抱歉，是我错怪你了。唉，作为星宫的男性修士总是被宁州五行宗门的修士瞧不上，久而久之也有些过于敏感，还请见谅。¤Sorry, I was the one who blamed you. Alas, the male cultivators of the Star Palace are always looked down upon by the cultivators of the Five Elements Sect of Ning Province, and they have become too sensitive over time, please forgive me.
我只是...¤I just...
（看他这反应，难不成真是被冤枉的？还是先制服他再说吧。）¤(Looking at his reaction, could it be that he was really wronged? Let's subdue him first.)
不知{$NpcName}有何棘手的事找我？¤I don't know what trouble {$NpcName} is looking for me?
所以是想让我帮忙逐他离开？¤So you want me to help drive him away?
但{$NickName}为何会知道这些呢？我没记错的话，你不是星河剑派门人吧？¤But how does {$NickName} know this? If I remember correctly, you are not a disciple of the Galaxy Sword Sect, are you?
酒尽菜绝后方推说有事而离席。¤After drinking all the dishes, he said that he had something to do and left the table.
那我便收下了。¤Then I took it.
不过话说回来，辛苦{FirstName}{$Nickname}道友了，也让{$ZaiXia}和星河剑派的修士们安心不少，多谢，{$Xia}¤But having said that, the hard work {FirstName}{$Nickname} has brought {$ZaiXia} and the cultivators of the Galaxy Sword Sect a lot of peace of mind. Thank you, {$Xia}
而且实不相瞒，我有位好友也是星河剑派门人，也正是她此前在传音符中与我提起此事，我才上前询问的，结果他一开口比我还不耐烦。这才请{FirstName}{$NickName}过来相商此事。¤And to be honest, I have a good friend who is also a disciple of the Galaxy Sword School, and it was she who mentioned this to me in the sound transmission before, and I went up to ask, but he was more impatient than me when he opened his mouth. That's why {FirstName}{$NickName} came over to discuss the matter.
{$NpcName}倒也不恼，又招呼你饮酒品菜，对之前的事绝口不提。¤{$NpcName} is not annoyed, and then greets you to drink and eat food, and never mention the previous thing.
关心则乱嘛，理解，理解。¤Care is chaos, understand, understand.
我有位交好的星河剑派修士此前在传音符中向我提起此事，还说虽然有些担心，但碍于门派关系不能随意出手逐他离开，烦闷得紧，这才请{FirstName}{$NickName}过来相商。¤A cultivator of the Xinghe Sword Sect that I have been friends with mentioned this to me in the sound transmission. He also said that although he was a little worried, due to the relationship between the sect, he couldn't shoot him out at will, and he was very bored, so I asked {FirstName}{ $NickName} is here for business.
这是说好的报酬，请收下。¤This is the promised reward, please accept it.
{FirstName}{$NickName}你可算来了，我这等得都...¤{FirstName}{$NickName}You're here, I've been waiting...
但即便如此，他当初也只是远远的感受到炼心芝的气息而已，随后便被守护在其身边的妖王给发现，只好赶紧离开了。如今不知是那炼心芝提前成熟，还是妖王用了什么手段，我在他说的位置竟感受不到炼心芝的气息，只得在这附近慢慢寻找。¤But even so, he only felt the breath of Lianxinzhi from a distance at first, and then he was discovered by the demon king who was guarding him, so he had to leave quickly. Now I don't know if the Lian Xinzhi matured ahead of time, or if the demon king used some method. I couldn't feel the aura of Lianxinzhi in the position he said, so I had to look around here slowly.
辛苦{FirstName}{$Nickname}道友了，此举让{$ZaiXia}和星河剑派的修士们安心不少，多谢。¤Thank you, fellow Daoist {FirstName}{$Nickname}, for doing this, {$ZaiXia} and the cultivators of the Galaxy Sword Sect have a lot of peace of mind. Thank you.
多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}愿意前来。¤Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName} for coming.
{$Xiao}，不久不久，我就这急性子，你别放心上。¤{$Xiao}, I'll be so impatient soon, don't worry about it.
不过一点小忙而已，亏我还第一个就找你帮忙呢。算了算了，我去找其他人帮忙吧。¤It's just a little busy, but I'm the first to ask you for help. Forget it, let me find someone else to help.
那星宫修士显然是已经远去，并未听到你的言语，自然也不会有回应。¤The Xinggong cultivator is obviously far away and has not heard your words, so naturally there will be no response.
这可不是我...¤this is not me...
此事与门派无关，我与星宫从未有仇怨。¤This matter has nothing to do with the sect, and I have never had a grudge with Xinggong.
（这便是{$NpcName}说的那个星宫修士吧？）¤(This is the star palace cultivator that {$NpcName} said?)
整日闭关修炼是有些枯燥，但既然选择了修真一途，{FirstName}{$NickName}只怕是早就做好准备罢。¤It is a bit boring to practice in seclusion all day, but since he has chosen the path of self-cultivation, {FirstName}{$NickName} may have been prepared long ago.
宁州金丹期以上的修士谁人不知这炼心芝早就在宁州绝迹，没想到还会有人以此为借口来掩盖自己令人不耻的行迹。¤None of the cultivators above the Jindan stage in Ning Province knew that this Refinement Zhizhi had long since disappeared in Ning Province, and no one would have thought that there would be people who would use this as an excuse to cover up their shameful deeds.
你在星河剑派附近骚扰其中女修，还有理了？¤You harassed the female cultivators near the Galaxy Sword Sect. Is it reasonable?
是有此意。原本我想询问他一番，但此人有些不好交流，所以想请{FirstName}{$NickName}帮忙交涉一番。¤It is intended. Originally I wanted to ask him, but this person is a little difficult to communicate with, so I would like to ask {FirstName}{$NickName} to help negotiate.
你本只想心平气和的询问一番，但这星宫修士不知为何态度竟如此恶劣，让你也是气不打一处来。¤You just wanted to ask calmly, but this Xinggong cultivator had such a bad attitude for some reason, which made you angry.
少时，这星宫修士眼见不是你对手，也顾不上脸面，连忙出声试图让你停下手来。¤When I was young, this Xinggong cultivator saw that he was not your opponent, and he didn't care about his face, and quickly tried to make you stop.
{$ZaiXia}听信流言，误解星宫，当罚。¤{$ZaiXia} listen to rumors, misunderstand the star palace, and be punished.
道友对星宫的男性修士是不是有什么误解？¤Do fellow Daoists have any misunderstandings about the male cultivators in the Star Palace?
事情其实很简单，就是有一个星宫的男性修士最近一直在星河剑派外逗留，看他那样子我就不顺眼。¤The matter is actually very simple. There is a male cultivator from the Star Palace who has been staying outside the Galaxy Sword Sect recently. I don't like him looking like that.
所以你不是为了星河剑派的修士停留在这附近的？¤So you didn't stay here for the cultivators of the Galaxy Sword Sect?
你不会真是在做什么与星河剑派有关的事吧？¤Are you really doing something related to the Galaxy Sword Sect?
无须客气。¤You are welcome.
原来如此。多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}解开此层误会，我稍候会转告星河剑派的好友。¤I see. Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName} for clearing up this misunderstanding, I will tell the friends of the Galaxy Sword Sect later.
唉，这么些时日还未发现炼心芝的气息，只怕是已被人捷足先登了。我还是另想办法吧，省的又引起误会。¤Alas, I haven't found the aura of Lianxinzhi for so many days, I'm afraid that someone has already taken the lead. I'd better think of another way to save another misunderstanding.
（虽说可能是误会，但不论如何他也离开了，回去复命吧。）¤(Although it may be a misunderstanding, he left anyway, so let's go back and recover.)
不等你再说什么这星宫修士已是转身离去。只有那满溢的愤懑还留在原地，萦绕不散。¤Without waiting for you to say anything, this Xinggong cultivator turned around and left. Only the overflowing resentment remained in place, lingering.
那想让我怎么帮忙呢？¤So how do you want me to help?
你也只是轻轻点头，表示没往心里去。¤You just nodded slightly, indicating that you didn't take it to heart.
但你并没有理会他的意思。直到他只守不攻连连求饶，你才在击破他防御并小小惩戒他一番后，停下手来。¤But you didn't pay attention to what he meant. It wasn't until he kept begging for mercy that he could not attack, and then you stopped after breaking his defense and punishing him a little.
他为你斟好酒又以双手持杯奉上，而后才为自己也斟满。¤He pours the wine for you and serves it in both hands before filling it for himself.
{$Xiao},痛快！¤{$Xiao}, rejoice!
哦？既是{FirstName}{$NickName}所说，那应是不会错了。¤Oh? Since {FirstName}{$NickName} said, it should not be wrong.
你刚迈入云汐城的客栈，{$NpcName}便迎了上来。打招呼的语气除高兴外似乎还掺杂些抱怨，不过反应倒是很快，后半句话还没说出口便是戛然而止。¤As soon as you entered the inn in Yunxi City, {$NpcName} greeted you. The tone of greeting seemed to be mixed with some complaints in addition to happiness, but the response was quick, and the second half of the sentence stopped abruptly before he could say it.
唉，事情是这样的。我有一位关系很好的星河剑派修士，此前在传音符中找我抱怨说最近总有个星宫的男性修士在星河剑派近旁逗留，令其有些担忧。¤Alas, here's the thing. I have a cultivator of the Galaxy Sword Sect with whom I have a good relationship, and I had complained to me in the sound transmission that there was always a male cultivator from the constellation staying near the Galaxy Sword Sect, which made him a little worried.
哦？愿闻其详。¤Oh? Appreciate further details.
呵呵，若是寻常修士倒不无可能，但这星宫向来以双修为重，星河剑派又是女性修士圣地，只怕他是心怀鬼胎。¤Hehe, if it is an ordinary cultivator, it is not impossible, but this star palace has always been a double cultivation, and the Xinghe Sword Sect is a holy place for female cultivators, I am afraid that he has a ghost.
呵呵，{$ZaiXia}早料到他会找借口推脱，不过没想到他竟说自己在星河剑派附近寻找炼心芝。¤Hehe, {$ZaiXia} expected that he would find an excuse to shirk, but he didn't expect him to say that he was looking for Lian Xinzhi near the Galaxy Sword Sect.
看你败在我手下后还敢不敢口放狂言！¤See if you dare to speak madly after you are defeated by me!
怎么，我星宫修士不过是在这星河剑派的附近停留一会，在你眼里就是骚扰女修了？¤Why, my Star Palace cultivator just stayed near the Galaxy Sword Sect for a while. In your eyes, I am harassing the female cultivator?
等...等等！你真的冤枉我了！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤wait wait wait! You really wronged me! {vpunch=10,0.5}
怕不是心虚了。¤Afraid not guilty.
哦？为何？¤Oh? Why?
多谢！¤Thank you!
要知道这炼心芝早就在宁州绝迹，怎么可能会在星河剑派附近出现。¤You must know that this Lianxinzhi has long since disappeared in Ning Province, so how could it appear near the Xinghe Sword Sect?
若不是{$NpcName}说你在这附近骚扰星河剑派的女性修士，还托我出面赶你离开，我可没兴趣管你星宫的人想做什么。¤If it wasn't for {$NpcName} saying that you were harassing the female cultivators of the Galaxy Sword Sect around here and asking me to drive you away, I wouldn't be interested in what the people in your star palace want to do.
这件事嘛，对我棘手，但对{FirstName}{$NickName}你只是一桩小事而已。¤Well, it's tricky for me, but a trifle for you {FirstName}{$NickName}.
不知{$NpcName}何事找我？¤I don't know what {$NpcName} is looking for?
那今天{FirstName}{$NickName}可是看走眼了。¤Then {FirstName}{$NickName} was wrong today.
{$Xiao}，不过是借口而已，{FirstName}{$NickName}切莫相信他。¤{$Xiao}, it's just an excuse, {FirstName}{$NickName} don't trust him.
至少我不是那么龌蹉的修士。¤At least I'm not such a dirty cultivator.
久等了。¤Awaited.
我...别派的男修士能在星河剑派附近停留，为何我星宫就不行？¤I... men from other sects can stay near the Xinghe Sword Sect, why can't we star palace?
敢说不敢认，我看你才是自己口中的小人！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Dare not to admit it, I think you are the villain in my mouth! {vpunch=10,0.5}
怕不是你的借口罢。¤I'm afraid it's not your excuse.
只见他轻叩桌面两下，便有道童端着酒菜上前来，一一摆放于桌上。¤As soon as he tapped the table twice, a boy came forward with wine and vegetables, and placed them on the table one by one.
云汐城盈手露，干焯剑芦，天元伏龙汤，请品尝。¤Yunxi City is full of hand dew, dry blanched sword reed, Tianyuan Fulong soup, please taste.
星宫的男性修士嘛，走到哪都不安好心，更何况还是在星河剑派这女性修士的胜地。¤The male cultivators of the Star Palace are uneasy and good-hearted wherever they go, let alone in the resort of the female cultivators of the Galaxy Sword Sect.
我在干嘛与你有何关系？¤What am I doing with you?
还有这等说法？¤And so on?
你步入云汐城客栈时，{$NpcName}正倚栏赏花。见你到来也是转头微笑，而后领你找了一处坐下。¤When you entered the Yunxi City Inn, {$NpcName} was leaning against the railing to admire the flowers. When I saw you coming, I turned my head and smiled, and then led you to a place to sit down.
来来来，喝酒。¤Come, come and drink.
{$NickName}说笑了。¤{$NickName} is joking.
不过话说回来，辛苦{FirstName}{$Nickname}道友了，也让{$ZaiXia}和星河剑派的修士们安心不少，多谢。¤But having said that, the hard work of fellow Daoist {FirstName}{$Nickname} has also brought much peace of mind to {$ZaiXia} and the cultivators of the Galaxy Sword Sect, thank you very much.
就星宫男性修士那风评，我只能说尽量吧。¤As far as the comments of the male cultivators in the Star Palace are concerned, I can only say try my best.
是有此意。原本我想询问他一番，但此人有些不好交流，所以只能请{FirstName}{$NickName}帮忙交涉一番。如非必要，还请不要用武力。¤It is intended. Originally, I wanted to ask him, but this person is a little difficult to communicate with, so I can only ask {FirstName}{$NickName} to help negotiate. Please don't use force unless necessary.
我之所以滞留在星河剑派附近，也不过是听说此处有炼心芝的踪迹而已。¤The reason why I stayed near the Xinghe Sword Sect was only because I heard that there were traces of Lian Xinzhi here.
你再啰嗦我要动手了！¤If you keep talking, I'm going to do it!
难得一见怎能只是叙旧呢？之前{FirstName}{$NickName}应允赴会后，{$ZaiXia}便是着手准备了。¤How can it be just a reminiscence of the past? After {FirstName}{$NickName} agreed to attend the meeting, {$ZaiXia} was ready.
岛主因身体原因正在殿内调息，特地吩咐我在此恭候道友苏醒，不知道友目前状态如何？¤The island owner is adjusting his breath in the temple due to physical reasons, and he specially ordered me to wait for the fellow Daoist to wake up. I don't know what is the current state of the friend?
第二天醒来时，你发现自己身在一处清雅的房间中。整顿衣裳出门后，你见到一位连家修士正在门口等候着你。¤When you woke up the next day, you found yourself in an elegant room. After finishing your clothes and going out, you saw a cultivator from the Lian family waiting for you at the door.
我已无碍了，劳道友及岛主挂心。¤I'm fine. Fellow Daoist Lao and the island owner are concerned.
哈哈哈，道友客气了。道友既已无恙，可方便随我前去内殿觐见岛主？¤Hahaha, Fellow Daoist is polite. Since Fellow Daoist is fine, can he follow me to the inner hall to meet the island owner?
那就烦请道友接引了。¤Then please ask fellow daoists to lead me.
如果是外门弟子在大比中夺魁，还可以直接成为内门弟子，拜入门派中任一一位长老门下修习。¤If the outer disciple wins the championship, you can also directly become the inner disciple and worship any one of the elders of the novice school to practice.
没想到此行竟如此凶险，还好师妹你能平安归来。¤I didn't expect this trip to be so dangerous. Fortunately, sister, you can return safely.
不错{shidi}，看来你已经领取了入门的功法，至于其他的基础法术，你可以多多向外门的传功长老请教。¤Yes {shidi}, it seems that you have already received the basic skills. As for the other basic skills, you can ask the elders from the outer door.
还有一件重要的事情你须得记住，我派每隔三十年会与星河剑派联袂举办宗门大比，所有炼气期的弟子皆可参加。¤There is one more important thing you must remember. Every 30 years, we will hold a sect contest with the Galaxy Sword Sect. All disciples in the Qi refining period can participate.
虽然我们星河剑派在这次试炼中位列前茅，但却有三位师妹在魔物的手下丧了命。¤Although our Galaxy Sword Sect was among the best in this trial, three juniors were killed by the monsters.
星河剑派？¤The Galaxy Sword Sect?
你先去{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}挑选入门功法，之后再回来找我。¤You first go to {color=#d0380a} Tibetan Scripture Pavilion{/color} to choose an introductory exercise, and then come back to me.
此次能战胜地魔你功不可没，不愧是我们星河剑派的弟子！¤This time you can fight against the demon, you must be a disciple of our Galaxy Sword Sect!
那是自然，上一届的猎魔试炼便是由我带着其他筑基期的师妹们一起参加的。¤That's natural. The last demon hunting trial was attended by me and other juniors from the foundation building period.
我派与星河剑派素来交好，两派合力举办宗门大比也已经是很多年来的一个传统了。虽然只是外门比试，但也事关宗门荣誉，各位长老对此都非常重视。¤My faction and the Galaxy Sword faction have always had a good relationship, and the two factions have joined forces to hold the Zongmen Grand Competition. It has been a tradition for many years. Although it is only an outer contest, it is also a matter of the honor of the Zongmen. Every elder attaches great importance to this. .
{FirstName}{$daoyou}，请。¤{FirstName}{$daoyou}, please.
看来这些凡俗景色定是入不了{FirstName}{$daoyou}的眼了。¤It seems that these mundane views must be beyond the eyes of {FirstName}{$daoyou}.
难道仅凭这块令牌，就能冒充那名杀手的身份？¤Could this token alone be used to impersonate that assassin?
是...或者说，曾经是的。¤It is... Or rather, it used to be.
好酒。¤Good wine.
那名地字杀手没能活着回来，但让我意外的是，那杨雄琦也没能活着逃走。¤That earth-letter assassin did not return alive, but to my surprise, that Yang Xiongqi did not escape alive either.
{FirstName}{$daoyou}能想到这一层，便已超过绝大多数的人了。¤{FirstName}{$daoyou}To think of this level is more than most people can say.
既然如此，今日你我二人便只谈风月。刚刚我说的那些话，{FirstName}{$daoyou}全当没有听过便是了。¤In that case, today you and I will only talk about the wind and the moon. The things I said just now, {FirstName}{$daoyou} just pretend you never heard of them.
哈哈哈，没想到{FirstName}{$daoyou}也是懂酒之人。¤Hahahaha, I didn't realize {FirstName}{$daoyou} was also a wine savvy person.
公孙府与血剑宫素无瓜葛，即便风雨楼曾经接取过几个有关血剑宫的悬赏，但爷爷的身份亦是机密，绝非一般人能知晓的。¤The Gongsun House has never been involved with the Blood Sword Palace, and even though the Wind and Rain House has taken several bounties related to the Blood Sword Palace, Grandpa's identity is also confidential and is not something that can be known to the general public.
{$daoyou}不妨将灵力灌入那块令牌，看看，那块令牌背后印着的名字是什么。¤{$daoyou} might as well pour spiritual energy into that token and see, what is the name printed on the back of that token.
云汐城的花景乃宁州一绝，而城中最佳的观景之地，便是这听雨阁了。¤The flower scenery in Yunshi City is one of the best in Ning Province, and the best place in the city to view the scenery is this Hearing Rain Pavilion.
公孙季笑着向你敬酒。¤Gongsun Ji smiles and toasts you.
此为我公孙家绝密之事，即便在风雨楼中也仅有寥寥数人知晓，本不该说与外人。¤This is a top secret of the Gongsun family, and only a few people know about it, even in the Rain or Shine House, so it should not be told to outsiders.
难道...你是想让我冒充他的身份？¤Did... Are you trying to get me to assume his identity?
{$daoyou}若能接下刺杀元婴以上实力目标的天阶悬赏，很快便能晋升为天字杀手。¤{$daoyou}If you can take up a heavenly rank bounty for assassinating a target of YuanYing strength or above, you will soon be promoted to a heavenly word assassin.
时间长了，凶名在外，再加上各类仇杀悬赏，报酬颇丰，两兄弟也吸引了不少的散修慕名来投...这个接单杀人的组织，竟慢慢成为了宁州一股不可小觑的势力。¤As time went on, their fierce reputation, coupled with the fact that they were paid handsomely for all kinds of revenge killings, the two brothers attracted many independent cultivators to join them... This group of killers has slowly become a force to be reckoned with in Ning Province.
你来到公孙季面前坐下，他笑着替你斟了一杯酒，递到你面前。¤You come and sit down in front of Gongsun Ji, who smiles and pours a glass of wine for you and hands it to you.
近在眼前...原来如此...¤Nearly there... So it is...
普通地字杀手，想来他也不会注意。但你若能成为天字杀手，或许就会成为他拉拢的对象。¤An ordinary Earth-word killer, I don't think he will pay attention to it. But if you can become a heavenly character killer, you might become the one he pulls in.
你与公孙季品酒赏景，相谈甚欢，似乎刚刚什么也没有发生过一样，直到傍晚方才离开...¤You and Gongsun Ji enjoyed the wine and the view, talking as if nothing had just happened, and you didn't leave until late in the evening...
不过就在数年前，我的爷爷，同时也是当时执掌风雨楼的大长老公孙璞，意外的被一名血剑宫的元婴修士所害。¤But just a few years ago, my grandfather, and also the Grand Elder who was running the Wind and Rain Tower at the time, Gongsun Pu, was accidentally killed by a Blood Sword Palace YuanYing cultivator.
抱歉...我恐怕无法完全信任你。¤I'm sorry... I'm afraid I can't trust you completely.
哈哈哈，{FirstName}{$daoyou}可真是性情中人。¤Hahahaha, {FirstName}{$daoyou} can be a real sexagenarian.
你想让我怎么做？¤What do you want me to do?
公孙季看起来略微有些失落，但很快便又笑着帮你斟酒。¤Gongsun Ji looks slightly lost, but soon smiles again and pours your wine.
若是你发现这人其实怪病缠身命不久矣，死了反而解脱，你又当如何？¤What if you found out that this person was actually suffering from a strange disease and was dying soon, and death would be a release?
风雨楼的杀手分级，全凭完成悬赏的难度所定。¤The assassins of the Wind and Rain House are graded according to the difficulty of completing the reward.
但即便不能，也可以通过大量接取地阶悬赏的方式慢慢积累声望。¤But even if you can't, you can slowly build up your reputation by taking up a lot of ground-level bounties.
你缓缓将灵力注入令牌，果然有几个小字隐隐约约复现了出来...¤You slowly inject your spiritual energy into the token and a few small words faintly reappear...
那些人为求心爱之物，耗费些灵石倒也是正常的。¤It is normal for people to spend some spiritual stones to seek their beloved objects.
听雨阁每间厢房内都藏有我公孙家布下的小型传送阵，只需用你手中的这块风雨楼令牌便可激活。¤There is a small teleportation array hidden in each of the rooms of the Hearing Rain Pavilion, which can be activated simply by using this Rain or Shine House token in your hand.
{$daoyou}说的不错，但眼下却正是时机。¤{$daoyou} is right, but right now is the time.
不过听雨阁所酿的盈手露，可是修为再高深的修士都难以拒绝的妙物，不可不尝。¤However, the surplus hand dew brewed by the Hearing Rain Pavilion is a wonderful product that even the most profound cultivator would find hard to resist and must not be missed.
你把酒杯放到鼻下轻轻嗅闻，只觉得芳香扑鼻，令人精神也不由的为之一振。¤When you put the glass under your nose and sniff it, you feel the aroma of the wine and it lifts your spirits.
远在天边，近在眼前。¤Far from the sky, close to the eyes.
我自然愿意信任公孙兄...何况，我也很想听听你到底所求何事？¤I am naturally willing to trust Brother Gongsun... Besides, I would like to hear what it is that you want.
离火门长老杨雄琦，私通魔门古神教，叛逃在外。离火门私下开了很高的悬赏，要取此人的性命。¤Yang Xiongqi, the elder of the Heavenly Fire Gate, has fornicated with the Ancient God Sect of the Demon Sect and has defected from the country. The Heavenly Fire Gate has privately offered a very high reward for this man's life.
{FirstName}{$daoyou}，请入座吧。¤{FirstName}{$daoyou}, please take your seat.
凭此令牌，再加上这面具，除非{$daoyou}露出什么太大的马脚，否则是断然不会被发现的。¤With this token and this mask, unless {$daoyou} reveals something too big, it will definitely not be discovered.
我本不该出言试探，但此事毕竟多有难处。我要寻之人不仅要有不俗的实力，还必须心思机敏，否则随时可能陷入极为危险的境地。¤I should not have tried, but after all, this is a difficult matter. The person I am looking for must not only be very strong, but must also be resourceful, otherwise he could be in great danger at any time.
这盈手露虽说对我等修真者提升修为无甚帮助，但对那些贪杯之人而言，却是足以豪掷数千灵石求购之物。¤Although this surplus hand dew does not help us cultivators to improve our cultivation, for those who are greedy, it is enough to throw thousands of spirit stones for the item.
噢？我就不能只是为了找{FirstName}{$daoyou}一起品酒赏景么？¤Oh? Can't I just find {FirstName}{$daoyou} to sip wine with and enjoy the view?
你拿起酒杯，微微抿了一口。酒液入口并不辛辣，而是带着微甜，口感醇厚。缓缓咽下后，整个口腔中都弥漫着残留的酒香。¤You pick up the glass and take a slight sip. The wine is not spicy in the mouth, but slightly sweet and mellow. After a slow swallow, the lingering aroma of the wine fills your entire mouth.
你接过面具，隐约察觉到其上有灵力流转，似乎铭刻了某种特殊的法阵。¤You take the mask and vaguely perceive that there is spiritual energy flowing through it, as if it is inscribed with some kind of special spell formation.
你向杯中看去，见此酒呈透明状，色泽清亮。¤You look into the glass and see that this wine is clear and bright in colour.
听完你的回答，公孙季轻摇手中折扇，似乎若有所思...¤After hearing your answer, Gongsun Ji flicked his fan in his hand and seemed to be thinking...
更重要的是，此事背后还涉及有关公孙府的绝密之事...所以此人必须是我能完全信任，并且也愿意完全信任我的人。¤More importantly, there are top secret matters concerning the Gongsun House behind this matter... So this person must be someone I can trust completely and who is also willing to trust me completely.
{$daoyou}有所不知，但凡风雨楼杀手都会佩戴一枚特殊的面具，用以遮掩身份。¤{$daoyou} don't know, but all Wind and Rain House assassins wear a special mask to conceal their identity.
此二人公开接收悬赏刺杀的任务，对于不同境界，不同实力的目标明码标价。似乎只要委托者能够出得起价，就没有他们杀不了的人。¤These two men openly accept bounties for assassination missions, and they set prices for targets of different realms and strengths. It seems that as long as the client can afford to pay the price, there is no one they cannot kill.
我与你之间的交际从未隐藏，有这层关系在，恐怕就难以取得他的信任吧？¤I have never hidden my intercourse with you, and with this relationship in place, I fear it will be difficult to gain his trust?
你接过酒杯，直接一饮而尽，只觉得满口都是醇厚的酒香。¤You take the glass and drink it straight away, only to feel the mellow aroma of the wine filling your mouth.
而想要取得琚运琦的信任，{$daoyou}只需要表现的像一个真正{color=#d0380a}为赚取赏金而来的杀手{/color}即可。¤And to gain Ju Yunqi's trust, {$daoyou} just need to act like a real {color=#d0380a} hitman who is here to earn a bounty{/color}.
这么多年过去了，{$daoyou}无论是心境还是修为都与当年大不相同。如今若是再遇到这些问题，{$daoyou}还会是和当年一样的答案么？¤After so many years, both {$daoyou}'s state of mind and cultivation are very different from then. If I were to encounter these questions again today, would {$daoyou} still have the same answers as back then?
你步入厢房，只见一名白袍公子正坐于窗边，手持折扇，望着窗外。顺着他的目光向外望去，逸风城的美景一览无余。¤You step into the compartment and see a white-robed gentleman sitting by the window, holding a folding fan and looking out. Following his gaze outwards, the beauty of Yifeng City is unmistakable.
{$daoyou}若是顶替这{$daihao}的身份加入风雨楼，就能名正言顺的领取这份赏金。这也算是我赠与{$daoyou}的一份小小的礼物吧。¤If {$daoyou} takes this {$daihao}'s identity and joins the Rain or Shine House, he will be able to collect this bounty in name only. This is a small gift from me to {$daoyou}.
好，我都明白了。¤OK, I get it all.
不知{FirstName}{$daoyou}有没有听说过风雨楼的名号？¤I wonder if {FirstName}{$daoyou} has ever heard of the Rain or Shine House?
传说宁州曾有一对修为高深的兄弟，一人名唤望风，一人自称听雨。他们无名无派，立足于宁州，全靠一身出神入化的暗杀手段。¤Legend has it that there was once a pair of brothers in Ning Province, one named Wangfeng and the other calling themselves Listen to the Rain. They had no name and no affiliation, and they were based in Ning Province thanks to their amazing assassination skills.
哈哈哈，当然不是。¤Hahaha, of course not.
噢？那我倒是很好奇，{$daoyou}对于灵石是怎么看的？¤Oh? I'm curious then, what does {$daoyou} think about spirit stones?
杀人越多，仇恨越多，宁州各派又如何能容得下这样一个组织...即便他们中的不少人，也曾在这里花钱买过他人的性命。¤The more people they kill, the more hatred they have. How can the factions of Ning Province tolerate such an organisation... Even many of them have paid for the lives of others here.
风雨楼原本接下了此单，不过这杨雄琦应该是练了什么魔门的秘术，实力远超预估。¤The Wind and Rain House originally took this order, but this Yang Xiongqi should have practiced some secret technique of the Demon Sect and his strength far exceeded the prediction.
没想到...以布阵闻名的公孙家背后还有这段辛秘...¤Little did I know... The Gongsun family, famous for their formations, has this secret behind them...
当年风雨楼门人被各大门派视为邪修，当除之而后快。最后替他们提供庇护的，正是我公孙家祖上。¤Back then, the disciples of the Wind and Rain Tower were regarded as evil cultivators by all the great sects and should be eliminated before they could be removed. It was my Gongsun family ancestors who provided them with shelter in the end.
不错，但不知{FirstName}{$daoyou}...你是否愿意相信我？¤Nice, but I wonder if {FirstName}{$daoyou}... Are you willing to trust me?
美景还需配好酒才行。这听雨阁所酿的盈手露，可是修为再高深的修士都难以拒绝的妙物，不可不尝。¤A beautiful view needs to be accompanied by good wine. The dew brewed by the Hearing Rain Pavilion is a wonderful product that even the most profound cultivator would find hard to resist.
这样的组织，本就该藏匿于地下，无论是锋芒太露到令人恐惧，还是遭人嫉妒，都绝非好事。¤It is never good for an organisation like this, which should be hidden underground, to be either too exposed to be feared or to be envied.
你怀疑，风雨楼中有人故意把消息放给血剑宫？¤Do you suspect that someone in the Storm Tower deliberately released the information to the Blood Sword Palace?
在{$daoyou}如今看来，灵石是什么？¤What is a spirit stone in {$daoyou}'s eyes these days?
我希望你能够加入风雨楼，以你的实力，或许有机会晋升为天字杀手。¤I hope you can join the Rain or Shine House. With your strength, you may have a chance to be promoted to the Heavenly Assassin.
还记得当年与{FirstName}{$daoyou}初识时，曾在公孙府问过你几个问题，不知{$daoyou}还记得么？¤I remember when I first met {FirstName}{$daoyou}, I asked you a few questions at the Gongsun Mansion, I wonder if {$daoyou} still remembers?
原来如此...不愧是以布阵闻名的公孙家。¤So it is... True to form, the Gongsun family is famous for their formations.
公孙兄特地约我来此，又问了这么些奇怪的问题，应该不只是为了找我品酒赏景吧？¤Brother Gongsun has asked me to come here and asked such strange questions, so I don't think he's just looking for me to enjoy the scenery with a glass of wine, right?
为求自保，风雨楼遣散了大部分的门人，自此再不公开接受悬赏，而是像突然消失了一般，隐匿在了看不见的黑暗之中。¤In order to protect itself, the House of Wind and Rain dispersed most of its members and has since stopped accepting bounties openly, instead disappearing as if out of nowhere, hiding in the darkness.
公孙季没有直接回答你的问题，而是拿起桌上的酒壶，替你斟了一杯酒，笑着说道...¤Instead of answering your question directly, Gongsun Ji picked up the wine jug on the table, poured a glass of wine for you and said with a smile...
所谓正派修士，也是各有私心罢了。若是这风雨楼能为他们所用，自然是好。但要是反过来威胁到了自身，那又是绝对无法容许的。¤The so-called righteous cultivators have their own selfish ambitions. If the Wind and Rain Tower can be used for them, it is naturally good. But if it threatens them in turn, that is absolutely unacceptable.
一些小手段罢了。何况杀手各自的真实身份，在风雨楼中也属机密，一般来说是不会特意调查的。¤It's just a few small tricks. Besides, the true identities of the assassins are confidential in the Rain or Shine House, and generally speaking, they will not be investigated on purpose.
风雨楼的规矩，是杀人，领赏。人是谁杀的，这赏金自然就应该归谁。¤The rule of Wind and Rain House is to kill someone and receive a reward. Whoever killed the person, this bounty should naturally go to whoever.
那两兄弟中的一人就唤作听雨，我早该想到这听雨阁和他有所关联的。¤One of those two brothers is called Listen to the Rain, and I should have thought that this Court of Listen to the Rain had something to do with him.
若是当年望风和听雨二人早早就能意识到这点，后来风雨楼也不至于因此遭重。¤If only the two of them had realised this earlier, the House would not have suffered so much.
公孙兄若是不信任我，今日应该就只剩品酒与赏景，断不会与我说这些了吧。¤If Brother Gongsun did not trust me, he would have only been enjoying the wine and the scenery today, and would not have talked to me about this.
若是有人出大量的灵石，向你买一位无辜者的性命呢？¤What if someone offered you a large amount of spiritual stones to buy the life of an innocent person?
自那以后，便是由我们公孙府长老与风雨楼天字杀手共同组成的长老会在暗处掌管风雨楼，处理各类悬赏的接取事宜。¤Since then, it is the Council of Elders, formed by our Gongsun House Elders and the Heavenly Assassins of the Wind and Rain Tower, who are in charge of the Wind and Rain Tower from the shadows, handling the acceptance of all kinds of bounties.
而杀死这杨雄琦，并且从那名风雨楼杀手身上拿走令牌的，恰好就是{$daoyou}你。¤And the one who killed this Yang Xiongqi and took the token from that Rain or Shine House assassin happens to be {$daoyou} you.
望风，听雨...这个势力便是你刚刚提到的风雨楼吧？¤Look out for the wind, listen to the rain... This force is the Rain or Shine House you just mentioned, right?
二来，你以独立的身份进入风雨楼，或许可以找机会获取琚运琦的信任，暗中调查有关血剑宫的消息。¤Secondly, if you enter the Rain or Shine House as an independent person, you may be able to find an opportunity to gain Ju Yunqi's trust and secretly investigate news about the Blood Sword Palace.
一来，天字杀手已有资格介入风雨楼长老会，到时我在长老会中也可多一分势力。¤For one thing, the Heavenly Assassin is already qualified to intervene in the Elders' Council of the Storm House, and I will have an additional point of power in the Elders' Council when the time comes.
{FirstName}{$daoyou}，我确有一事需要相助。¤{FirstName}{$daoyou}, I do have a matter that I need to help with.
公孙兄想请我相助之事，与这风雨楼有关么？¤Is the matter that Brother Gongsun wants to ask for my help related to this Rain or Shine House?
还有些印象。¤Some impressions remain.
爷爷死后，大长老之位便由他的弟子，在风雨楼中威望颇高的琚运琦继任。若说长老会中有谁在此事中获益最大，那便是此人了。¤After Grandpa's death, the position of Grand Elder was taken over by his disciple, Ju Yunqi, who was highly respected in the Rain or Shine House. If there is anyone in the Council of Elders who has benefited the most from this matter, it is this man.
是伴生的冰精芝么，那妖王应该就在附近了。¤Is it the accompanying Bingjingzhi, then the demon king should be nearby.
是伴生的火精芝么，那妖王应该就在附近了。¤Is it the accompanying Huojingzhi, then the demon king should be nearby.
是伴生的苦蔓藤么，那妖王应该就在附近了。¤Is it the accompanying bitter vines, then the demon king should be nearby.
是伴生的天剑笋么，那妖王应该就在附近了。¤Is it the accompanying Tianjian bamboo shoots, then the demon king should be nearby.
是伴生的地龙干么，那妖王应该就在附近了。¤What is the accompanying earth dragon doing, the demon king should be nearby.
千流岛上常设擂台，只要能在擂台上取得优秀的名次便会受到当地势力的赏识，甚至还能学习他们独特的功法...不过千流岛的供奉看起来都有些奇怪。¤There is a permanent arena on Qianliu Island. As long as you can get an excellent ranking in the arena, you will be appreciated by the local forces, and you can even learn their unique techniques... But the guest elders of Qianliu Island all seems a bit strange.
回忆此次九霄雷狱种的种种异象，你陷入了空灵顿悟之境。¤Recalling the visions of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison seeds on this occasion, you fall into a state of ethereal epiphany.
呼~这就是九霄雷狱的先天之雷么。¤Phew~ Is this the innate lightning of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison.
你感受到在经过天雷的洗礼之后，大量的先天灵气强化了你的肉身。你甚至能看到一缕缕电花在肌肤之下一闪而过。¤You feel the vast amount of innate spiritual energy strengthening your physical body after the baptism of heavenly thunder. You can even see wisps of electric flowers flashing beneath your skin.
不错不错，这雷鸣海上人妖两族都梦寐以求的九霄雷狱，你不仅找到了还在其中收获颇丰嘛。¤You have not only found the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, which is the dream of both human and demon races on the Thunder Sea, but you have also gained a lot from it.
在吸收了足够的先天灵气之后你便退了出来。¤You retreated after absorbing enough of the innate aura.
不过，这雷鸣海也非善地，既然目的达到了，我们速速离去吧。¤However, this Thunder Sea is not a good place either. Since our purpose has been achieved, let's leave quickly.
这可就要从几百年前说起了，当时的百里家也是碎星岛上一大望族，掌管碎星岛坊市的贸易。¤This will start from hundreds of years ago. At that time, Bailijia was also a prominent family on Broken Star Island, in charge of the trade in Broken Star Island.
但两族的恩怨似乎并未解决，百里族人只要离开蓬莎岛，进入龙族所在的海域便会受到攻击。¤But the grievances between the two clans do not seem to be resolved. As long as the Baili people leave Pongsha Island and enter the sea area where the dragons are located, they will be attacked.
你知道这宅子是百里家的？¤Do you know this house belongs to the Baili family?
原来如此，多谢道友告知。¤That's the case, thank you fellow daoist for letting me know.
当时海兽入侵宁州的广陵城，给当地带来了巨大的损失。几次兽潮过后大抵是龙族与广陵城及蓬莎岛签订了什么协议，他们才退回化龙海域不再生事。¤At that time, the sea beasts invaded Guangling City in Ning Province and brought huge losses to the local area. After several beast influxes, it was probably the dragons who signed some agreement with Guangling City and Pongsha Island before they returned to the Dragonborn Sea area and no more trouble.
龙族穷追不舍，百里家迫不得已举族搬迁至宁州，饶是如此这龙族也不曾放弃，竟鼓动化龙海域内的海兽向宁州发起攻击。¤The dragons are chasing after them. The Baili family has no choice but to relocate to Ning Province. This is the case. The dragons never gave up, and they instigated the sea beasts in the Dragonborn Sea to attack Ning Province.
你是说百里家的那栋老宅子？¤You mean the old house of Baili's family?
麻烦道友给我说说，那栋宅子到底是怎么回事？¤Thank you fellow daoist to tell me what the hell is going on in that house?
哼，这座岛上我知道的事儿可多着呢。¤Hmph, I know a lot about this island.
道友可知道巷里的旧宅什么来历？¤Do you know the origin of the old house in the alley?
后来不知怎的，这百里家竟得罪了龙族。当时碎星岛商会会长也曾试图化解矛盾，最后却不了了之。¤Later, for some reason, the Baili family offended the Dragon Clan. At that time, the president of the Broken Star Island Merchant Guild also tried to resolve the conflict, but in the end it was nothing.
太好了，我也正有此意。以后多跟我分享一点有趣的见闻嘻嘻。¤It's great, I have this intention. I will share more interesting insights with me in the future.
唉...爹说以我的天赋，要是用点功早就应该筑基了。还说要是我再突破不到筑基，就不让我出门了！¤Oh... Dad said that with my talent, if I worked a little bit, I should have built the foundation. He also said that if I can't break through to build the foundation, I won't let me go out!
你怎么一付闷闷不乐的样子？¤Why are you so glum?
道友，要购买仙府吗？¤Fellow Daoist, would you like to purchase the immortal mansion?
道友，这处仙府的灵眼我们已经帮你升级了。¤Fellow Daoist, the spirit eye of this immortal mansion we have already upgraded for you.
道友，需要我带您去洞府看看吗？¤Fellow Daoist, do you need me to show you to the cave?
洞府的品阶按照灵眼的等级分为上、中、下三品；品阶越高，闭关修炼的速度与灵田的收益越高。¤The grade of the cave is divided into upper, middle and lower grades according to the grade of the spiritual eye; the higher the grade, the higher the speed of the closed cultivation and the gain of the spiritual field.
道友，可有意向？¤Fellow daoist, do you have any interest?
是的，我逸风城其下是一座巨大的灵脉，由玄道宗布下一座大阵控制，交由我宁王府管理，届时我们会调整输送的灵力以提升洞府的灵眼品质。¤Yes, my Yi Feng City under its is a huge spiritual vein, controlled by the Hidden Dao Sect to lay down a large formation, to my Ning Wang House management, when we will adjust the spiritual power delivered to enhance the quality of the cave's spiritual eye.
道友，这仙府售价72万灵石。¤Fellow Daoist, this immortal mansion sells for 720,000 spirit stones.
道友来此有何贵干？¤What is the purpose of your visit?
不过什么？¤But what?
道友，这仙府只能由声望达到略有薄名的修士购买。¤Fellow Daoist, this Immortal Mansion can only be purchased by cultivators whose reputation has reached a slightly thin name.
我似乎灵石不足。¤I seem to be short of spirit stones.
正是，我们逸风城名下正有一无主的仙府正在出售，不过...¤Exactly, there is an immortal mansion with no owner being sold under our name in Yifeng City, but...
道友，这仙府升级需要22万灵石。¤Fellow Daoist, this Immortal Mansion needs 220,000 spirit stones to upgrade.
道友，这处仙府就在我逸风城旁，以后如要改名或是升级灵眼可来找我。¤Fellow Daoist, this immortal residence is right next to my Yi Feng City, if you want to change your name or upgrade your spirit eye in the future you can come to me.
听闻你们这里有洞府出售？¤I heard that you have caves for sale here?
眼下这处洞府还是下品灵眼...¤This cave is still a lower-grade spirit eye...
道友来此，可是来购买仙府的？¤Daoist friends come here, but to buy the immortal mansion?
不过，道友放心，我宁王府还提供付费升级的服务，嘿嘿。¤However, do not worry, I Ning Wang House also provides paid upgrade service, hehehe.
道友，这仙府只能由声望达到声名远扬的修士购买。¤Fellow Daoist, this Immortal Mansion can only be purchased by a cultivator whose reputation has reached notoriety.
升级？¤Upgrade?
下品灵眼，也未免太过....¤The lower grade spirit eye is not too much ....
道友，这仙府售价5万灵石。¤Fellow Daoist, this Immortal Mansion is priced at 50,000 spirit stones.
哼，是你赢了...¤Hmph, you win...
哼，就这么死了，真是便宜那赤发鬼和青面鬼了。¤Hmph, it's just like that, it's really cheap, the red-haired ghost and the green-faced ghost.
咳咳咳...等我养好伤，一定不会放过沂山那两只小鬼！¤Cough cough cough... When I recover from my injury, I will definitely not let the two little ghosts in Yishan go!
嗯？？¤Ok??
哈哈哈哈，这天机阁不过如此，待我进去看看都有什么奇珍异宝。¤Hahahaha, this Heavens Secrets Pavilion is nothing more than that, wait for me to go in and see what rare treasures there are.
林沐心越过宫主看到你到来，很是活泼地向你打着招呼，好像...只是出来游山玩水而已...¤Lin Muxin crossed the palace lord to see you coming, and greeted you very lively, as if... just came out to play in the mountains...
那我和冲虚战斗前见到的宫主就是蕊宫仙子？¤Then the palace lord I saw before the fight with Chongxu was Fairy Ruigong?
磔磔磔，现在才知道已经晚了。¤It's too late to know now.
一时间，眼前的场景让你有些难以置信。¤For a time, the scene in front of you makes you a little unbelievable.
但之前我不是已经帮你去公孙府讨要过极品盈手露了么？¤But didn't I already help you go to Gongsun Mansion to ask for the best hand-made show?
你一时间也不知该说什么，只好抱住林沐心，尝试安慰她。¤You didn't know what to say for a while, so you could only hug Lin Muxin and try to comfort her.
你赶到林沐心和神秘修士的战场时，却看到宫主正背对着你与林沐心交流着什么。¤When you arrived at the battlefield between Lin Muxin and the mysterious cultivator, you saw that the palace lord was communicating with Lin Muxin with his back to you.
但在冲虚散人的话音落下后，在你耳旁响起的只有不远处林沐心与魔修交手的声音在阵法空间内回响。¤But after the voice of Chongxu Sanren fell, the only sound that rang in your ears was the voice of Lin Muxin and evil cultivator fighting not far away in the formation space.
待你和林沐心点头应承后，星凝玉手一挥，驾驭着灵气包裹住在场四人，升至高空后急速往星宫方向飞去。¤After you and Lin Muxin nodded and agreed, Xing Ningyu waved her hand, and controlled the spiritual energy to wrap the four people in the field. After rising to a high altitude, she quickly flew towards the star palace.
你...刚才不是身受重伤了么？怎么还有余力...¤You... weren't you seriously injured just now? How can there be any spare...
但在冲虚散人的话音落下后，在你耳旁响起的只有不远处林沐心与魔修交手的声音在昏暗的阵法空间内回响。¤But after the voice of Chongxu Sanren fell, the only sound that sounded in your ears was the voice of Lin Muxin and evil cultivator fighting not far away, echoing in the dim array space.
不对哦心儿，以前指点你修炼的可都是我呢。¤No, Xin’er, I was the one who instructed you to cultivate before.
但在冲虚散人的话音落下后，在你耳旁响起的只有一如既往的怨恨悲啸，除此之外就只有不远处林沐心与魔修交手的声音在昏暗的阵法空间内回响。¤But after the voice of Chongxu Sanren fell, there was only resentment and wailing in your ears as always, besides that, only the voice of Lin Muxin and evil cultivator fighting not far away echoed in the dim array space.
给我添了这么多麻烦，也该消停了。¤It has caused me so much trouble, and it's time to stop.
之前指点你修炼的时候，可都是这么叫的呢，心儿。¤When you were instructing you to cultivate before, it was always called that, Xin'er.
你当了多少年星宫宫主了？¤How many years have you been the Lord of the Star Palace?
极品盈手露那次不是带上你了嘛。¤Didn't Need Pin Yingshoulu bring you that time?
咳，我们神教可是实力又岂是你能窥探的。¤Cough, our divine religion is powerful, how can you spy on it?
星宫宫主啊，应该有一千多年了吧。¤Lord of the Star Palace, it must have been more than a thousand years.
还是先让我缓缓吧...¤Let me take it easy...
是啊，当时我不是说了嘛，如果认真起来他可不是我对手。¤Yes, didn't I say it at the time, if he is serious, he is not my opponent.
宫主？怎么回事？¤Palace Lord? what happened?
我就是{$Xing}哦，嘻嘻。¤I'm {$Xing} oh, hee hee.
第二次相遇时，你一个人就能把那邪教剿灭，结果还让我对上教主。¤The second time we met, you alone could wipe out that cult, and in the end let me confront the cult leader.
眼见冲虚散人惊慌到语无伦次的样子，你也是有些反感。¤Seeing Chongxu Sanren's panic and incoherent appearance, you are also a little disgusted.
谢谢{FirstName}{$NickName}的帮助，可惜我实力不足没能保护好宫主，浪费你一番努力。¤Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName} for your help, but unfortunately I am not strong enough to protect the Palace Master well, it was a waste of your efforts.
刚才我在与那神秘修士战斗时，阵法突然就开始消散...那人则是一见阵法出问题就开始猛烈攻击，甚至完全放弃防守。¤When I was fighting the mysterious cultivator just now, the formation suddenly began to dissipate... The man started to attack violently as soon as the formation went wrong, and even gave up the defense completely.
{$Lin}，你怎么样？¤{$Lin}, how are you?
{$Lin}你早就知道了？¤{$Lin}You already knew that?
不，不要，我...¤no, no, I...
原来你们在更早的时候还有这么丰富的经历啊，这么有趣，还不带上我。¤It turns out that you had such a rich experience earlier, it was so interesting, and you didn't bring me with you.
你赶到林沐心和神秘修士的战场时，这里站着的已只有林沐心。而那神秘修士却是不知去向，倒是宫主还倒在一片沙化的土地上。¤When you arrived at the battlefield between Lin Muxin and the mysterious cultivator, only Lin Muxin was standing here. But the mysterious cultivator did not know where to go, but the palace lord was still lying on a piece of sandy land.
嘻嘻，那我们先回星宫吧。¤Hee hee, let's go back to the Star Palace first.
{size=28}都说了不要叫我心儿了...{/size}¤{size=28}I said don't call me my heart...{/size}
盈手露啊，那只是刚好嘴馋了而已，不作数的哦，嘻嘻。¤Yingshoulu ah, that's just a greedy mouth, it doesn't count, hee hee.
但在冲虚散人的话音落下后，在你耳旁响起的只有一如既往的怨恨悲啸，除此之外就只有不远处林沐心与魔修交手的声音在阵法空间内回响。¤But after the voice of Chongxu Sanren fell, only the resentment and grief as always sounded in your ears, in addition to this, only the voice of Lin Muxin and the evil cultivator fighting not far away echoed in the formation space.
那三百年前在林家那次，你明明就是宫主，为何还引来冲虚散人，这可不是我主动的了吧？¤When you were in the Lin family three hundred years ago, you were clearly the palace lord, so why did you attract the rushing people? Wasn't it my initiative?
你一阵无语时，却看见林沐心在宫主背后偷笑。¤When you were speechless for a while, you saw Lin Muxin snickering behind the palace lord.
你还在提出自己的疑问，却看到星宫宫主转过身来，你看到她怀里还有穿着同样衣服的另一位“宫主”。¤You are still asking your own questions, but you see the Palace Master of the Star Palace turn around, and you see another Palace Master wearing the same clothes in her arms.
警惕半晌后，你终于是忍不住开了口。而冲虚散人狰狞的表情也是逐渐消融，留下的只有惊慌与绝望。¤After being vigilant for a while, you finally couldn't help but speak. The ferocious expression of Chongxu Sanren gradually melted away, leaving only panic and despair.
呵，两三百年过去你还是没有长进嘛，看来费劲心力破除你这奇门绝魂阵真是多此一举。¤Heh, two or three hundred years later, you still haven't made any progress. It seems that it is superfluous to work hard to break your Qimen Absolute Soul Array.
星铃儿嘛，不是我女儿哦。¤Xing Linger, not my daughter.
刚才我在与那神秘修士战斗时，阵法突然开始消散。那人之前像是在设法拖住我，一见阵法出问题却开始拼命。¤When I was fighting the mysterious cultivator just now, the formation suddenly began to dissipate. The man seemed to be trying to hold me back before, but when he saw that there was a problem with the formation, he started desperately.
你上前检查了一番宫主的状况，果然已是神魂消散，只剩一副了无生气的躯壳而已。¤You went up to check the status of the palace lord, and sure enough, the spirit has dissipated, leaving only a lifeless body.
不，不会的...咳，咳咳...明明说好的，只要除去你们，我就可以趁势入主星宫，将来为神教踏破宁州出一份力换取突破的机缘...不...不会的，神教不会骗我的...¤No, I won't... Cough, cough, cough... As long as I get rid of you, I can take advantage of the situation to enter the star palace, and in the future, I will do my best for the divine religion to break through Ning Province in exchange for the opportunity to break through... .No...No, the Cult won't lie to me...
哦？可惜不会有下一次了。若不是你那护短的师父无惑真人极力保住你，甚至连这一次都不应该有。¤Oh? Too bad there won't be a next time. If it wasn't for your short-guarding master, Wuhuo Zhenren, who tried his best to protect you, he wouldn't even have had this time.
古神教？与{$Lin}战斗的那位难道是古神教的邪修？元婴修为的魔教修士怎会悄无声息的出现在宁州？¤Ancient gods? Could the one fighting against {$Lin} be a cultist of the Ancient God Cult? How could a evil cultivator with the cultivation base of Nascent Soul quietly appear in Ning Province?
（当年，若是没有我插手那场不公平的结侣，冲虚散人，无惑真人，林家姐妹，现在又该是如何呢。）¤(Back then, if I hadn't intervened in that unfair coupling, what would have happened to the Chongxu scattered people, the Confusion-free real people, the Lin family sisters, now.)
我...我没事...只是那神秘修士被我击中后化为了一抔黄土，有...有些惊讶。¤I... I'm fine... It's just that the mysterious cultivator turned into a handful of loess after being hit by me. I was... a little surprised.
袖手旁观？你们难道来了不止两个元婴修士？¤Stand by? Could it be that there are more than two Nascent Soul cultivators here?
星铃儿就是你，而你就是星宫宫主？¤Xing Linger is you, and you are the Palace Master of the Star Palace?
在冲虚散人说话时，你随意地往周围扫了一眼。在刚才的打斗中为了不彼此影响，两处战场分散了开来，林沐心虽不在你的视野范围内，但可以感知到那边是斗了个旗鼓相当，短时内分不出胜负，也不用急着去支援。¤While speaking to the Void Sanctuary, you glanced around casually. In the fight just now, in order not to affect each other, the two battlefields were separated. Although Lin Muxin is not in your field of vision, you can sense that the battle is evenly matched, and there is no winner or loser in a short time. rush to support.
那不是你和心儿散布谣言害我废了好多心力平息在先嘛，我只是想扳回一局。¤It's not that you and Xin'er spread rumors that made me lose a lot of energy and calm down first, I just want to get back a game.
{$Lin}...不是你的错，谁能想到这些魔教妖人竟会如此...¤{$Lin}...it's not your fault, who would have thought that these demons could be like this...
啊？不...不是，我也是才知道的。¤Ah? No... no, I just found out.
那次可是你主动要加入的哦，而且我也是知道他肯定不是你对手，才让你去的呢。¤That time, you took the initiative to join, and I also knew that he was definitely not your opponent, so I let you go.
算你理多...¤Count how much you...
咳，至少我用大阵击杀了星宫宫主，神教必将待我不薄，到，咳咳...到神教威镇宁州的时候，我一定会好好折磨你，让你求生不得求死不能，磔咳，磔磔。¤Cough, at least I killed the Star Palace Palace Master with a great formation, the Divine Religion will definitely treat me well, come, ahem... When the Divine Religion Weizhen Ning Province, I will definitely torture you and let you survive Can't beg for death, can't, sigh, sigh.
谁...谁知道...¤who... who knows...
这...这是！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤This...this is! {vpunch=10,0.5}
呀！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Ah! ! {vpunch=10,0.5}
我...我...我分辨不出来啦！¤I...I...I can't tell the difference!
他最后更是在硬受我一击，趁势来到蕊宫仙子身边，我还以为...¤In the end, he took a hard blow from me, and took advantage of the situation to come to Fairy Ruigong, I thought...
带上你可不是就更“有趣”了...¤Wouldn't it be more interesting with you...
是的呢。¤Yes, it is.
最后更是在硬受我一击，趁势来到宫主身边...虽然我迅速补上了致命一击，让其化为那摊沙土...但宫主的神识波动也...¤In the end, he was hit hard by me and took advantage of the situation to come to the palace master... Although I quickly made up the fatal blow and let it turn into that pool of sand... But the palace master's consciousness fluctuated...
原本在击败冲虚后放松的你如今又提起了警惕，虽说你不惧元婴修士的神通，但与古神教交手甚少，天知道这些魔修会些什么邪门功法。¤You, who had relaxed after defeating Chongxu, have now raised your vigilance again. Although you are not afraid of the magical powers of the Nascent Soul cultivator, you have rarely fought against the ancient gods. God knows what wicked techniques these evil cultivators know.
但...但宫主她...¤But... but the palace lord she...
护短？咳咳...他在乎的不过是自己的面子罢，星宫大长老的弟子修习采补之术传出去让他那张老脸往哪搁，咳磔磔。¤Protect short? Cough cough... He only cares about his own face. The disciples of the elders of Xinggong have spread the technique of harvesting and nourishing to let his old face rest, cough.
甚至，在这无人知晓之地消失得如此彻底，未留下哪怕一丝痕迹。¤Even, it disappeared so completely in this unknown place, leaving no trace.
嗯...你该不会是为了多活一会在忽悠我吧。还是说，那什么玄骨抛弃你了？¤Hmm... you're not fooling me just to live a little longer. Or, what mysterious bone abandoned you?
玄骨，你再袖手旁观就要错过机会了！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Profound Ancient, if you stand by and watch, you will miss the opportunity! {vpunch=10,0.5}
所以，我们第一次相遇时，你根本不需要我救...¤So, when we first met, you didn't need my help at all...
我...我没事...但...¤I...I'm fine...but...
好像也是诶，不然我都不知道公孙家还藏了这么好的酒。¤It seems to be the same, otherwise I wouldn't know that the Gongsun family still hides such a good wine.
喂，你就没有什么想问的么？¤Hey, don't you have any questions?
这是我的道侣哦，姓柳，名红鸾，{FirstName}道友也可以叫她蕊宫仙子。准确的说，你是救了心儿和鸾儿呢。¤This is my Taoist companion, her surname is Liu, her name is Hongluan, and fellow Taoist {FirstName} can also call her Fairy Ruigong. To be precise, you saved Xin'er and Luan'er.
咳，该死，咳咳，别太得意了，下次...咳咳咳，下次我一定要你好看，在神教面前，不论是你，还是星宫，都只是蝼蚁而已。¤Cough, damn, cough, don't be too proud, next time... cough, cough, next time I must make you look good, in front of the gods, whether it is you or the star palace, they are just ants.
不仅如此，当年你在林家与冲虚对峙时见到的宫主也是蕊宫仙子。¤Not only that, the palace lord you saw when you faced off against Chong Xu at the Lin family was also Fairy Ruigong.
没事就好。¤It's fine.
好吧，好吧，辛苦了。心儿，我们回去吧。¤Well, well, hard work. Heart, let's go back.
{size=28}不要叫我心儿...{/size}¤{size=28}Don't call me my heart...{/size}
是{$Lin}那边！刚才不是还平分秋色么，难道被那什么玄骨偷袭了？不行，我得赶紧过去。¤It's the {$Lin} side! Wasn't it still evenly divided just now, was it attacked by that mysterious bone? No, I have to hurry over there.
我...们带宫主回天星城吧，至少...带她回家。¤Let's... take the Palace Master back to Star City, at least... bring her home.
星凝玉手一挥，驾驭着灵气包裹住在场四人，升至高空后急速往星宫方向飞去。¤With a wave of Xing Ningyu's hand, the four people living in the room wrapped in spiritual energy, and after rising to a high altitude, they quickly flew towards the Xinggong.
（唔，难道是我想太多，{$Lin}刚才的惊呼并不是因为出现了意外么？）¤(Well, am I thinking too much, isn't {$Lin}'s exclamation just because of an accident?)
{size=24}她就是宫主...{/size}¤{size=24}She is the Palace Master...{/size}
不过若不是那废物给我求情，我只怕是早死在了星凝那贱人的手下，也不会有加入古神教的机会，磔磔磔。¤However, if it wasn't for that bastard to plead for me, I'm afraid that I would have died at the hands of that slut Xing Ning, and I wouldn't have had the chance to join the ancient gods, Deng Deng Deng.
你无视冲虚的求饶，用神通击穿了他的泥丸宫，随后又将其元婴绞成齑粉。¤You ignored Chongxu's plea for mercy, pierced through his Niwan Palace with your magical powers, and then twisted his Nascent Soul into powder.
你赶到林沐心和神秘修士的战场时，这里站着的已只有林沐心。而那神秘修士却是不知去向，倒是宫主身旁有一抔黄土。¤When you arrived at the battlefield between Lin Muxin and the mysterious cultivator, only Lin Muxin was standing here. But the mysterious cultivator did not know where to go, but there was a swathe of loess beside the palace lord.
不用再安慰了，我...们还是先带宫主回天星城吧，至少...带她回家。¤No need to comfort any more, let's...let's take the Palace Master back to Star City first, or at least...take her home.
不过好在宫主赶到了，及时击杀了那个邪修。然后我才知道以前见到的宫主都是蕊宫仙子。¤Fortunately, the palace master arrived and killed the evil cultivator in time. Then I learned that the palace lords I had seen before were all Fairy Rui Gong.
这就送你上路吧，不，应该让你完全消失在此世间。¤This will send you on your way, no, it should make you completely disappear from this world.
这就是你所谓的阵法威能么？奇门绝魂阵，呵，名字倒是听起来挺厉害，只可惜配上了你这不堪一击的废物。¤Is this what you call the power of formation? Qimen's Soulless Array, oh, the name sounds quite powerful, but it's a pity that it is matched with your vulnerable waste.
冲虚散人又咳出两口血，显然是受伤不轻。面色虽是愈发苍白，但表情却愈发扭曲狰狞。¤Chongxu Sanren coughed up two more mouthfuls of blood, apparently injured. Although his complexion became paler, his expression became more distorted and hideous.
至此，不知悔改的冲虚散人终于是结束自己漫长且卑劣的一生，随着奇门绝魂阵的溃殂，落得魂飞魄散的下场。¤At this point, the unrepentant Chongxu Sanren finally ended his long and despicable life, and with the collapse of Qimen's Soulless Array, he ended up in a state of utterly devastated souls.
{FirstName}道友，此番多谢了，要不是你，我和心儿只怕是要受困于冲虚散人与古神教之手。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, thank you very much for this time. If it weren't for you, Xin'er and I would have been trapped in the hands of the Chongxu Sanren and the ancient gods.
不远处传来林沐心的惊呼，打断了你短暂的思考。¤Lin Muxin's exclamation came not far away, interrupting your brief thinking.
我曾经可是在离火门待过两年，尽得炼器真传！好的法器往往蕴含玄机，关键时候以灵力催动，便能助你反败为胜。¤I used to stay Heavenly Fire Gate for two years, and I can get the true teachings of the refining tools! Good magical tools often contain mystery, and when they are critical, they can help you turn defeat into victory.
你这儿的兵器可比我这把破剑漂亮多了！¤Your weapon here is much more beautiful than my broken sword!
有什么好看的，还不快去修炼！¤There is nothing to see, so hurry up and practice!
虽然主要还是师父的说教，但你一些独到的理解也着实让师父意外。¤Although it's mainly Master's lectures, some of your unique understandings have really surprised Master.
并没有达到第三层。¤did not reach the third level.
战斗持续的时间越长，给敌人种下的木毒也就越多。¤The longer the battle, the more poison accumulates.
师父不耐烦地看了你一眼。¤The master looked at you impatiently.
本门主修土道，但运用五行相生之法，所以金、水、木、火道也需了解一二，尤其是火道。¤This school mainly cultivates the Tao of Earth, but uses the method of mutual generation of the five elements, so the Tao of Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire also needs to know a thing or two, especially the Tao of Fire.
师父略带鄙夷地看了你一眼。¤Master gave you a slightly contemptuous look.
可还记得同门较量的规矩？¤Can you still remember the rules of the competition?
徒儿心意虽好，但要是落下了修炼可就不好了。¤Although the disciple's intentions are good, it will be bad if he falls into practice.
这五柳根，是突破金丹必不可少的药材，你自己也要多备一些，到时候用得着。¤These five willow roots are essential medicinal materials for breaking through the Golden Core. You should also prepare more for yourself.
叠焰流的功法神通搭配，首先要从五行相生入手。达成五行相生的各式木系手印想必你在练气期已经掌握娴熟，我就不多废话了。¤The combination of the supernatural powers of the stacking flames must first start with the five elements. You must have mastered all kinds of wood-based handprints to achieve the mutual generation of the five elements, so I won't talk nonsense.
接下来，修炼这{$gongfa}，你且听好。¤Next, practice this {$gongfa}, and listen carefully.
我们寿元虽长，但若没有一本天阶修炼功法，只怕修至寿元将近，也摸不到那瓶颈吧。¤Although our lifespan is long, if we don’t have a Heavenly Rank cultivation method, I am afraid that we will not be able to touch the bottleneck when we reach the end of our lifespan.
只见师父眉头微皱，似乎在担心什么事情。犹豫片刻后，师父拿出一瓶丹药交予了你。¤I saw the master frown slightly, as if he was worried about something. After hesitating for a moment, Master took out a bottle of medicinal pill and handed it to you.
你渐渐落入了下风，师父也及时收住了手。¤You gradually fell into a disadvantage, and the master stopped it in time.
只见师父眉头微皱，将信将疑地看着你，露出担忧的神情。¤I saw Master frown slightly, looking at you suspiciously, showing a worried look.
不愧是我徒儿，就知道你不会有事。¤As expected of my disciple, I know you will be fine.
罢了罢了，你且听好…¤That's all, just listen...
你感悟尚浅，先去感悟{$dadao}道罢，略有小成之后，再来找我。¤Your understanding is still shallow, go and understand the {$dadao} Dao first, and come back to me after you have achieved a little success.
师父慢走…¤Master walk slowly...
这些东西等你有需要的时候，可以来向为师请教，也可以在藏经阁自行借阅。¤When you need these things, you can come to ask your teacher for advice, or you can borrow them yourself in the Sutra Collection Pavilion.
看来你需要学习的地方还很多啊~¤It seems that you still have a lot to learn~
不过就算你能胜过为师，也不能自满。宗内的招式毕竟是少数，外面还有无数更为强大精妙的功法神通，或许连为师都未曾听说。¤But even if you can excel as a teacher, don't be complacent. After all, there are only a few moves in the sect, and there are countless more powerful and subtle magic powers outside, perhaps even the teacher has never heard of it.
徒儿记住了。¤Disciple remembered.
你……切，不要就不要，我拿去给别人，她们谢谢我还来不及呢。到时候你结丹就结个废丹算了。¤You...Cut, if you don't want it, don't want it, I'll give it to others, and it's too late for them to thank me. When the time comes, you will end up with a waste pill.
本门的功法神通搭配，首先要从五行相生入手。达成五行相生的各式土系手印想必你在练气期已经掌握娴熟，我就不多废话了。¤The combination of the magic powers and magical powers of this sect must first start with the five elements. You must have mastered all kinds of earth-based mudras that achieve the mutual generation of the five elements.
大殿外，众长老仍在议论寒暄时，师父向你走了过来。¤Outside the main hall, while the elders were still discussing their greetings, Master came to you.
蓄势流的功法神通搭配，其核心在于不要让敌人打断你的蓄势。¤The core of the power technique and supernatural power collocation of the momentum flow is not to let the enemy interrupt your momentum.
师兄的弟子失败了，倘若师弟的弟子出手成功了，岂不是说明他教导有方？若是失败了也只是大家一起失败罢了，并没有任何损失。¤The disciple of the senior brother failed, if the disciple of the junior brother succeeded, wouldn't it mean that he taught well? If it fails, it is just that everyone fails together, and there is no loss.
说罢，师父转身便要离去。¤After saying that, the master turned around and was about to leave.
我的徒儿就是聪明~¤My apprentice is smart~
你若能完全掌握了凝沙诀，那么尘沙的攻守之道，你也就掌握大半了。¤If you can completely master the art of condensing sand, then you will also master most of the way of attacking and defending the sand.
是，师父。¤Yes, Master.
火道讲究强攻。所谓侵略如火，就是指进攻的时候要以最猛烈的攻势不断攻击敌人，决不退缩。¤Fire Road pays attention to strong attack. The so-called aggression is like fire, which means that when attacking, we must constantly attack the enemy with the most violent offensive and never retreat.
若不多寻些结丹的丹药与秘术，到时候你结了个废丹，可别找我哭鼻子。¤If you don't look for more Pill and secret techniques to form Pill, then you will end up with a waste Pill, so don't cry at me.
不错，已有小成。¤Yes, there is a small success.
借由不断使“尘”、“沙”相互转换，在攻击敌人的同时防护自身，可谓攻守兼备。¤By constantly transforming dust and sand into each other, it defends itself while attacking the enemy, which can be described as both offense and defense.
是……¤Yes……
徒儿没有问题。¤Disciple is no problem.
就算修为够了，若没有足够的丹药秘术，想突破也是难上加难……¤Even if the cultivation base is enough, if there is not enough medicinal herb secret technique, it will be even more difficult to break through...
去外出历练，云游四海，寻觅机缘，方可有所精进……¤Go out to experience, travel around the world, and look for opportunities before you can improve...
辛苦辛苦，这次可有什么收获？¤Hard work, what did you get this time?
师父，那妖王着实厉害，徒儿还不是对手。¤Master, that demon king is really powerful, and his disciple is not an opponent.
本门主修水道，准确的说是水道中的冰道。¤This sect majors in waterways, to be precise, ice channels in waterways.
接下来，你便要着手准备结丹了。为师还有事，你且去吧。¤Next, you have to start preparing for the formation of pills. I have something to do for my teacher, so go ahead.
对敌时需持续化焰，方可在化焰灵气之外形成一层灵气护盾。¤When facing the enemy, you need to continue Living Flame, so that a layer of aura Shield can be formed in addition to the aura of Living Flame.
毒道的功法神通搭配，都是围绕着如何快速向敌人种下木毒。¤The combination of techniques and skills of the Way of Poison all revolve around quickly planting poison on the enemy.
好…¤good…
你来啦。¤You're here.
若你对阵道通透，可修习{color=#d0380a}降魔锁骨阵{/color}，其威力相当不俗。¤If you are well-versed in the way of confrontation, you can practice {color=#d0380a}Clavicle Array{/color}, which is quite powerful.
不够。¤not enough.
当真？你运起功法试试。¤Really? Alright, try running the exercise.
{FirstName}{shidi}，别来无恙？¤{FirstName}{shidi}, stay safe?
如何处理宗门事务，如何准备下一次突破，如何应对魔修入侵，师父都比我更有经验……¤How to deal with sect affairs, how to prepare for the next breakthrough, how to deal with the invasion of evil cultivators, master is more experienced than me...
好，若你以后还有什么疑问，尽管来问我吧。¤Well, if you have any questions in the future, feel free to ask me.
好…你且去准备吧，为师等着你的好消息。¤Alright... Now go get ready, I'm waiting for your good news for the teacher.
{color=#d0380a}引力术{/color}虽然炼气就能修习，不过筑基期才能逐渐展现其威能。¤{color=#d0380a}Gravity Technique{/color} can be practiced by cultivating Qi, but its power can only be gradually displayed during the Foundation Establishment period.
虽然师父的理解远超于你，但他还是静静地听完了你的感悟。¤Although Master's understanding is far beyond yours, he still quietly listened to your insights.
好说好说，可有带些什么孝敬为师？¤It's easy to talk about it, but what kind of filial piety can you bring as a teacher?
化焰流的功法神通搭配，一切都要围绕以守代攻。¤The combination of the techiques for a Living Flame build must revolve around defending instead of attacking.
火道讲究强攻，虽说本门是以守为攻，但仍旧是以攻为主。¤Fire Dao pays attention to strong attack. Although this door is based on defense, it still focuses on offense.
师父你那么厉害，为何不随手把它除掉，怎还用得着我？¤Master, you are so powerful, why don't you just get rid of it, why do you still need me?
总而言之，若是有足够的准备时间，就算是高阶修士，也得倒在毒功之下。¤Overall, if you can drag the battle out long enough, even a high level cultivator will fall under your poison.
最后，除功法神通之外，有一柄好剑也至关重要。¤Finally, in addition to the magic power, it is also very important to have a good sword.
蓄势时需要稳扎稳打，正所谓重剑无锋，大巧不工。¤When gaining momentum, you need to fight steadily. As the so-called epee has no front, it is too clever to work.
若百花齐放，则会大大增强{color=#d0380a}落英{/color}的威力。¤If a hundred flowers bloom, the power of {color=#d0380a}Luoying{/color} will be greatly enhanced.
无妨，准备好之后再去吧。¤No problem, go when you're ready.
师尊又像往常一样，极为细心地说教了你一通。¤Master, as usual, taught you a lesson with great care.
“原来当初师父找我要五柳根，竟是为我炼丹所用……”¤It turns out that when the master asked me for five willow roots, it was actually used for my alchemy...
你且记住一点，剑宗一派，无论是借助何种外物，只要能增加剑法之威能，便可助你登峰造极。¤Remember one thing, the Sword Sect faction, no matter what kind of external objects it uses, as long as it can increase the power of swordsmanship, it can help you reach the peak.
什么受之有愧，这便是你应得的报酬，让你收下就收下……¤What you deserve, this is the reward you deserve, if you accept it, accept it...
火、气、阵道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤Fire, Qi, and Formation are further subdivided into several schools. You can choose one of them, and it will help you understand the Dao.
守时不动如山，攻时天崩地裂。攻守之间的平衡，便是需要你深思熟虑的地方了。¤Being punctual and moving like a mountain, when attacking, the sky and the earth are torn apart. The balance between offense and defense is where you need to think carefully.
这么珍贵的丹药，师父为何不自己留着呢？考验我也不用挑这么强的对手吧。¤Such a precious medicinal pill, why didn't Master keep it for himself? I don't need to pick such a strong opponent to test me.
这…除了那妖兽的材料外，并无其他收获……¤This... Except for the material of the monster, there is no other gain...
关于结丹的要点，你可都记住了？¤Have you remembered all the key points about the dandan?
你觉得师父的表情略显阴沉。¤You think Master's expression is a little gloomy.
罢了，你再下去练练吧，等有把握了再去。¤That's all, you go down and practice, and then go when you are sure.
除了冰魄经、玄冰劲外，{color=#d0380a}冰雨术{/color}也可助你更快地注入霜冻灵气。¤In addition to the Ice Soul Sutra and Xuan Bing Jin, the {color=#d0380a}Freezing Rain Technique{/color} can also help you infuse the Frost Aura faster.
啊？可是？¤Ah? But?
师父看了你一眼。¤Master looked at you.
都知道了吗？¤Do you know?
师父笑着看了你一眼。¤The master looked at you with a smile.
哈哈哈哈，爽快！¤Hahahaha, cool!
本门主修金道，但运用五行相生之法，所以水、木、火、土道也需了解一二，尤其是土道。¤This school mainly focuses on the golden way, but uses the method of mutual generation of the five elements, so the way of water, wood, fire and earth also needs to be understood a little, especially the way of earth.
罢了罢了，你要是哪里不懂，再来向我请教就是。¤That's all, if you don't understand anything, just ask me again.
大殿外，众长老寒暄过后皆已散去，只有你师父留了下来。¤Outside the main hall, the elders have all dispersed after their greetings, and only your master stayed.
师父笑着走到了你面前，双手抱拳作了一揖。仔细看来，笑得竟也是有些不自然。¤Master smiled and walked up to you, clasping his fists in both hands and bowing. Looking closely, the smile was a bit unnatural.
师父叹了口气，转身便要离去。¤The master sighed and turned to leave.
你要是不能做好这种觉悟，还不如早早放弃。¤If you can't do this kind of consciousness, you might as well give up early.
明白了吗？¤do you understand?
你二人说是论道，但自己却无太多理解，大都是师父指出你不足之处后的说教。¤You intended to discuss the Dao together, but you ended up not understanding much; mostly it was your master lecturing you.
你若是打不过那妖王，这机会我可就许给别人了。¤If you can't beat that Demon King, I'll give this chance to someone else.
是时候走出宗门，去寻觅更大的机缘了……¤It's time to go out of the sect and look for a bigger opportunity...
师父露出了担忧的神情。¤The master looked worried.
妖王？那水平岂不是远超寻常筑基期妖兽？我恐怕…¤Demon King? Isn't that level far beyond the ordinary base-building monsters? I'm afraid…
也正因如此，筑基期恐怕没有办法发挥本派的真正威力。¤Because of this, I am afraid there is no way to exert the true power of this faction in the Foundation Establishment period.
要是还有哪里不懂的，再来找我论道就是。¤If there are still some things you don't understand, you can come and discuss it with me.
其实这次除了考验你之外，还是有一点小小的考量…¤In fact, in addition to testing you this time, there is still a little consideration...
虽然这些理论知识你以前或多或少都听说过，不过师尊还是不厌其烦地又和你讲了一遍。¤Although you have heard of these theoretical knowledge more or less before, Master still took the trouble to explain it to you again.
徒儿明白了，定然不负师父重望。¤The disciple understands, and will definitely live up to the master's high expectations.
……知道啦，徒儿不会乱说的。¤...you know, the disciple will not talk nonsense.
徒儿还没有去…¤The disciples haven't gone yet...
另一半长老你倒是经常见面，谈笑起来也比较轻松写意。但你当初拜的师父却不在此列，看到他向你走来，你反倒是有些莫名的不安。¤The other half of the elders, you meet often, and it is easier to talk and laugh. But the master you worshipped was not included in this list. Seeing him walking towards you made you feel a little uneasy.
师尊又像往常一样，看似极不耐烦、又极为细心地说教了你一通。¤Master, as usual, seemed to be extremely impatient, but also taught you a lesson with great care.
师父，徒儿已经将那妖王除掉了。¤Master, the disciple has already got rid of the demon king.
哈哈哈哈，好！好徒儿，以后你若还有想问为师的，便再来找我罢。¤Hahaha, good! Good disciple, if you still want to ask about being a teacher in the future, you can come to me again.
徒儿已经将那妖王除掉了。¤Disciple has already got rid of the demon king.
好…你快去准备吧，为师等着你的好消息。¤Alright... go get ready, we are waiting for your good news.
只见他脸色一沉。¤I saw his face darken.
师父，哪有输了就跑的道理。¤Master, there is no reason to run away if you lose.
这个…的确很难领悟，¤This... it's really hard to comprehend,
你上前一把拉住了师父。¤You stepped forward and grabbed Master.
那妖王实力确实强劲，但总体来说并无大碍。¤The demon king is indeed strong, but overall it is not a big problem.
这是一颗稀有的玄武丹，你在与它交手之前服用，至少能护你无虞。¤This is a rare Black Tortoise Pill, you can take it before you fight with it, at least it can protect you.
接下来，何去何从，便皆由你自行定夺了……若还有何不懂，再来向我请教。¤Next, it's up to you to decide what to do next... If there is anything you don't understand, come ask me again.
木道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤Wood dao is seperated into several different paths, you can choose which path to follow and gain some abilities, which might help you understand the Dao in the future.
你可都记住了？¤Did you remember it all?
再去练练罢，等你有把握了再去。¤Go and practice again, and then go when you are sure.
若能在敌人尚未察觉时不断种下木毒，以弱胜强也并非不可能。¤If you can keep building up poison in your enemies before they can defeat you, it's possible to defeat those much stronger than you!
若你对五行相生之道理解到位了，并且灵根比较精纯，就可以进修{color=#d0380a}陨日轮炎诀{/color}来增加爆发。¤If you have a good understanding of the way of mutual growth of the five elements, and your spiritual roots are relatively pure, you can learn {color=#d0380a}Sunrise Wheel Flame Art{/color} to increase outbreaks.
师父瞥了你一眼。¤The master glanced at you.
若你灵根精纯，{color=#d0380a}纵地金光{/color}可助你快速积攒灵气，需熟练掌握。¤If your spiritual roots are pure, {color=#d0380a}Golden Light{/color} can help you quickly accumulate spiritual energy, which requires mastery.
若你在战斗中已经积攒了“尘”，则可以使用{color=#d0380a}尘衣{/color}进行防守，也可以使用{color=#d0380a}卸甲{/color}、{color=#d0380a}天崩地裂{/color}进攻。¤If you have accumulated dust in battle, you can use {color=#d0380a}dust clothes{/color} to defend, or use {color=#d0380a}disarm{/color}, {color=# d0380a}Breakthrough{/color} attack.
若有疑问，再联络罢。¤If you have any questions, please get in touch.
其旨在利用引力，将四周的尘沙转为护罩防御自身。¤Its purpose is to use Gravity to turn the surrounding dust into a shield to defend itself.
其旨在困敌之后，汲其血脉、反哺自身。¤After trapping the enemy, its purpose is to draw its blood and feed itself back.
片刻过后，师父终于开了口。¤After a while, the master finally spoke.
神剑诀。乃我年轻时，观连石山剑痕所悟。集剑道、金道于大成。¤Divine Sword Art. When I was young, Guanlian Shishan Jianken realized. Set Kendo, Jindao in Dacheng.
师父逐渐落入了下风，你在击败师父的前一刻收住了手。¤The master gradually fell into a disadvantage, and you held back the moment before you defeated the master.
去准备吧。¤Go get ready.
要掌握流光真诀，首先要理解的便是五行相生之道。若在使用本派杀招前先调用土系灵气，其威力增加的可不止一星半点。¤To master the flow of light, the first thing to understand is the way of the five elements. If you use the earth-type aura before using the ultimate move of this faction, its power can be increased by more than half a star.
冰道讲究以寒气御敌，以内力伤敌，而非动用外力。比起直接攻击敌人，本门对于控制更为注重。¤Ice Dao pays attention to defending the enemy with cold air, injuring the enemy with internal force, rather than using external force. Rather than attacking the enemy directly, this gate pays more attention to control.
师父，我已将{$gongfa}修练至第三层了。¤Master, I have practiced {$gongfa} to the third level.
虽然这些理论知识你以前或多或少都听说过，不过师尊还是耐心地又和你讲了一遍。¤Although you have heard of these theoretical knowledge more or less before, Master has patiently explained it to you again.
为师最后点拨你一番，你且听好。¤I will give you a final call for the teacher, and you should listen carefully.
徒儿只是侥幸赢了师父一次罢了，并不能说明太多。¤The disciple just beat the master by chance, and it doesn't explain too much.
若你有好好修习阵道，{color=#d0380a}赤炎灵阵{/color}与{color=#d0380a}聚灵阵{/color}也可以选择。¤If you have practiced the formation path well, you can also choose from {color=#d0380a}Scarlet Flame Spirit Array{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Spirit Gathering Array{/color}.
徒儿知道了。¤Disciple knows.
世界之大，无奇不有。切莫止步于宗门。¤The world's great wonders. Don't stop at the sect.
那你便快去快回吧，为师等着你的好消息！¤Then you can go and come back quickly, I am waiting for your good news for the teacher!
好！¤it is good!
师父又开始了他的日常说教。你没想到就为了这个事情，竟还要被师父训斥一顿。¤The master started his daily preaching again. You didn't expect to be reprimanded by the master just for this matter.
金道、剑道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，都可以帮你感悟大道。¤Jindao and Kendo are further subdivided into several schools. You can choose one of them, and it can help you understand the Dao.
算了算了，{$kaoyandidian}有一个筑基巅峰妖王，你去把它给除掉，就…当作为师对你的考较了。¤Forget it, {$kaoyandidian} has a base-building peak demon king, if you go and get rid of it, it will be... as a test for you as a teacher.
有什么想请教的？¤Is there anything you want to ask?
若你剑道已然小成，需着重感悟{color=#d0380a}轻剑{/color}之道。¤If you have mastered kendo, you need to focus on the way of {color=#d0380a}light sword{/color}.
不过你也不能沾沾自喜，悟道小成只不过是基础而已。¤However, you can't be complacent, the small achievement of enlightenment is just the foundation.
…修到我们这个境界，宗门能提供给我们的帮助就很少了。¤…If we have cultivated to our realm, there will be very little help that the sect can provide us.
都记住了吗？¤Do you remember?
流光真诀在我派流传甚久。当时我年轻气盛，刚好与这功法投缘，便选择了这套功法。¤The streamer truth has been circulated in my school for a long time. At that time, I was young and energetic, and just happened to have a relationship with this practice, so I chose this practice.
再就是与水灵妙法一同流传至今的神通{color=#d0380a}怒涛{/color}。它比之浪击威力更大，但消耗灵气也更多。¤Then there are the magical {color=#d0380a}raging waves{/color} that have been passed down together with the Water Spiritual Art. It is more powerful than Wave Strike, but consumes more aura.
怎么啦？¤What's going on?
本门主修木道，缠绕之道。旨在困敌自损，汲其精血。¤This sect focuses on the Dao of Wood. The goal is to trap the enemy and hae them self-inflict damage; absorbing their life and blood.
总的来说，若使用本派功法神通，能尽快解决敌人自然是上选，但若是不能，则要优先考虑如何消除副作用所带来的影响了。¤In general, if you use the magical powers of this faction, it is natural to be able to solve the enemy as soon as possible, but if you can't, you must give priority to how to eliminate the impact of side effects.
无用之事，莫要浪费时间。¤Useless things, don't waste time.
就算境界一样，我也未必是它的对手…¤Even if the realm is the same, I may not be its opponent...
你且听好…¤you listen up...
话虽如此，可仅凭这一颗丹药也结不出高品阶的金丹。若是结成的金丹不超过五品，就算结成了金丹，也几乎与结婴无缘了。反之若品阶越高，日后的修炼便越容易，结婴、乃至化神飞升的可能性就越高。¤Having said that, this medicinal pill alone cannot produce a high-grade golden Core. If the Golden Core formed does not exceed five ranks, even if the golden Core is formed, it is almost impossible to form a Nascent Soul. Conversely, the higher the rank, the easier it will be to cultivate in the future, and the higher the possibility of conceiving a Nascent Soul or even reaching Deity Transformation.
他一巴掌拍了下你的天灵盖，看似没用什么力，但差点把你拍了个趔趄。¤He slapped your Tianling cover with a slap, seemingly without much force, but he almost slapped you to the brink.
除此之外，为了能将爆发做到极致，“聚气”的过程必不可少，{color=#d0380a}静气诀{/color}与{color=#d0380a}燃烬{/color}就可以帮助你完成这个过程。¤In addition, in order to maximize the burst, the process of Qi Gathering is essential. The {color=#d0380a}Quiet Qi Technique{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Burning Cinder{/color} are can help you with this process.
若想进一步发展，就必须去各地寻觅不同寻常的机遇。¤If you want to go further, you have to look everywhere for unusual opportunities.
这些话你可不要到处乱说，要是让别人知道了，为师定要你好看！¤Don't talk nonsense about these words, if you let others know, you must be good-looking for the teacher!
一颗聚顶丹，远远不够。你要自己去找……¤A Juding Pill is far from enough. You have to find it yourself...
若是平常，考验是不会这么严苛的，只是…¤If it were normal, the test would not be so severe, but...
师父在讲解功法原理的同时，也演示起了功法。一个周天后，他停了下来，随手将一个玉简丢给了你。¤While explaining the details of the exercise, your master also gave you a demonstration. He stopped a weak later and threw a jade slip to you.
这聚顶丹，你收下。¤This Juding Dan, you accept it.
真的假的？¤Really? Alright, try running the exercise.
师父……那徒儿接下去应该何去何从？¤Master... what should the disciple do next?
师父从储物袋中取出一枚青色的玉简后，便开始讲解了起来。¤After the master took out a blue jade slip from the storage bag, he began to explain.
在战斗的最初阶段，霜冻灵气生效之前，你需要抵御敌人的进攻，此时{color=#d0380a}灵水诀{/color}便大有用处。¤In the initial stage of the battle, before the Frost Aura takes effect, you need to defend against the enemy's attack. At this time, the {color=#d0380a}Spiritual Water Technique{/color} is very useful.
但若要为师叔的面子着想，等他另派人解决会不会更为妥当？¤But if you want to think about Uncle Shi's face, wouldn't it be more appropriate to wait for him to send someone else to solve it?
为师最近在研制丹药，很是需要这妖丹，你看……¤My teacher has been developing medicinal pills recently, and I really need this demon pill, you see...
凝沙诀乃化尘教两大功法基石之一。¤Sand Condensing Art is one of the cornerstones of the two major exercises of the Dust Transformation Cult.
剑宗之功法神通搭配，首要便是与能打出多段伤害之剑法配合，最基本的便是本门的{color=#d0380a}金虹剑法{/color}。¤The first and foremost of the sword sect's magic and supernatural powers is to coordinate with the swordsmanship that can deal multiple damages. The most basic is the {color=#d0380a}Golden Rainbow Swordsmanship{/color}.
拜见师尊。¤Greetings Master
若你感悟过阵道，也可修习{color=#d0380a}土相仙阵{/color}，为日后需修习的高阶阵法打下基础。¤If you have comprehended the way of formation, you can also practice {color=#d0380a}Earth Immortal Formation{/color} to lay the foundation for the advanced formations that you will need to practice in the future.
再会。¤Goodbye.
人没事就好，待你休整好之后，有把握了再去吧。¤It's fine as long as you're okay. After you've rested, go ahead when you're sure.
师尊笑着上前拍了拍你的肩膀，便转身离开了。¤Master smiled and patted you on the shoulder, then turned and left.
这…徒儿只是除掉了一只筑基期妖兽而已，而这聚顶丹何等珍贵，我实在是受之有愧…¤This... disciple just got rid of a base-building monster, and how precious is this Juding Pill, I am truly ashamed of it...
若你灵根精纯，{color=#d0380a}寄杖诀{/color}也能助你快速补充木系灵气，值得修习。¤If your spiritual roots are already extremely pure, the {color=#d0380a}Standing Technique{/color} can help you quickly replenish your wood qi, which makes it worth practicing.
只见师父脸上严肃的神情稍显缓和了。¤I saw that the serious expression on Master's face eased slightly.
师父抿嘴笑了笑。¤The master pursed his lips and smiled.
若你金道已然小成，务必要参悟{color=#d0380a}蓄势{/color}与{color=#d0380a}重剑{/color}，将来必有大用。¤If you have already achieved a little of the Golden Path, be sure to comprehend {color=#d0380a}Gathered Force{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Heavy Sword{/color}, which will be of great use in the future.
怎么了。¤What's wrong.
叠焰诀是筑基期数一数二的战斗功法。¤The Stacked Flame Art is one of the best fighting techniques in the foundation building period.
师父叹了口气。¤The master sighed.
原来如此…那徒儿便去试上一试吧。¤So that's it... That disciple, let's try it out.
师父这阔绰的出手，让你察觉到事情并不简单。¤Master's generous move makes you realize that things are not simple.
至于尘的妙用，那便是后话了。¤As for the magical effect of dust, that is another story.
听了你的话，师父的失落像是被一扫而空，反倒大笑起来。¤After hearing your words, Master's disappointment seemed to be swept away, but instead he burst out laughing.
你也不知道你哪里表现出自满了，师父便又开始对你说教起来。¤You don't know where you are showing complacency, and the master starts lecturing you again.
化尘之功法神通搭配，自然以尘沙转换为主。¤The combination of the magical powers of the dust-turning technique is naturally based on the transformation of dust and sand.
谢师傅，那这丹药，徒儿便收下了。¤Master Xie, the disciple accepted this medicinal pill.
徒儿明白。¤The disciple understands.
太慢了，怎么现在才来。¤It's too slow, why is it coming now?
师父露出了思虑的神情。¤The master showed a worried look.
金道讲究不破不立，置之死地而后生。流光真诀便是一套先破后立的功法。¤Jin Dao pays attention to not being broken or standing, and that it will be born after death. The True Flowing Light is a set of exercises that break first and then stand.
水灵妙法在本门流传已久，乃是最正统的水系功法。¤The water spirit magic method has been circulated in this sect for a long time, and it is the most orthodox water system practice method.
即便如此，你学到的东西仍旧是化尘的基础，若想真正展现其威力，还需进修更高阶的功法神通。¤Even so, what you have learned is still the foundation of dust transformation. If you want to truly show its power, you still need to learn higher-level magical powers.
{color=#d0380a}沙葬{/color}作为五行相生的核心神通，与化尘另外一大功法基石{color=#d0380a}凝沙诀{/color}也有配合，需熟练掌握。¤{color=#d0380a}Sand Burial{/color} is the core supernatural power of the five elements, and it also cooperates with the other great foundation stone of the dust transformation, {color=#d0380a}Sand Condensation Technique{/color}, and needs to be mastered.
无妨，待你休整好之后，有把握了再去吧。¤It doesn't matter, after you have rested, you can go again when you are sure.
这补灵丹可保你灵气充裕，生生不息。有此丹药，想必那妖王便不在话下吧。¤This tonic pill can keep your aura full and endless. With this Pill, the demon king must be no problem.
好了，闲话就止于此，剩下的，你便自己思量吧。¤Well, the gossip will stop here, the rest, you can think for yourself.
哈哈哈哈哈，如今你与我一个境界，便可以同辈相称了，今后你我以师兄弟相称即可。¤Hahahaha, now that you and I are in the same realm, you can be equal to your peers. From now on, you and I can be equal to each other as senior brothers.
水系的功法神通搭配，首先要从五行相生入手。达成五行相生的各式金系手印想必你在练气期已经掌握娴熟，我就不多说了。¤The combination of the water system's magic and supernatural powers must first start with the five elements. You must have mastered all kinds of gold-based handprints to achieve the mutual generation of the five elements, so I won't say more.
如果用最快的速度击败对手，就可以让自己受到的伤害降至最低，这就是以攻代守之道。¤If you beat the opponent with the fastest speed, you can minimize the damage you receive. This is the way of attacking instead of defending.
这等基础都记不住？罢了罢了，你且听好…¤Can't remember the basics? That's all, just listen...
“原来师父是在操心我结丹的问题…”¤It turns out that Master is worrying about my formation of pills...
你刚来为师门下，为师且试试你这水有多深罢。¤You have just become my disciple, let's see how deep your understanding of the dao is...
算了，勉为其难再教你一次吧，你听好了。¤Forget it, let me teach you one more time, just listen carefully.
所以你要抓紧时间搜集结丹用的丹药秘术，仅凭为师送你的丹药和门派的结丹秘术可远远不够……¤So you have to hurry up and collect the secret medicine pills used for forming pills. It is far from enough just to give you the medicine pills and the secret pill forming techniques of the sect...
师父又说教了你一番，就像往常一样。¤The master lectured you again, as usual.
这个应该不难，难道是我哪里教的不好……¤This shouldn't be difficult, could it be that I didn't teach well...
这都记不住？¤Can't remember this?
唉……¤Ugh……
为师给你准备了一颗极其珍贵的丹药，保准万无一失。¤The teacher has prepared an extremely precious medicinal pill for you, which is absolutely safe.
师父走到了你面前，双手抱拳作了一揖。仔细看来，神情竟也是有些不自然。¤Master walked up to you, clasped his fists with both hands and bowed. Looking closely, his expression was a little unnatural.
哼，不愧是我的弟子，还挺厉害。¤Hmph, as expected of my disciple, quite amazing.
可还有疑问？¤Still have questions?
你向师父鞠了一躬，便转身离开了。¤You bowed to the master, turned and left.
弟子都记住了。¤This disciple has remembered it all.
至于如何困敌，则要靠其他功法神通。¤As for how to trap the enemy, you have to rely on other magic powers.
哼，你有空想这些，还不如多想想自己结丹该怎么办。¤Hmph, if you have time to think about these things, you might as well think more about what to do with your own pill formation.
水剑的功法神通搭配，其重点在于对{color=#d0380a}“振剑”{/color}的理解。¤The combination of the martial arts and supernatural powers of the water sword is focused on the understanding of {color=#d0380a}“vibrating the sword”{/color}.
你还是第一次见师父这副摸样，有些不知所措，大殿外竟短暂地安静了下来。¤This is the first time you have seen Master's appearance, you are a little overwhelmed, and the hall is quiet for a short time.
除开五行相生，如何积蓄力量则是重中之重。{color=#d0380a}游神御水诀{/color}配合{color=#d0380a}御水诀{/color}便可以有效地积蓄力量。¤Apart from the mutual generation of the five elements, how to accumulate strength is the most important thing. The {color=#d0380a}Wandering God Technique{/color} combined with the {color=#d0380a}Water Control Technique{/color} can effectively accumulate strength.
知道了吗？¤Do you understand?
师父略有所思地看了你一眼。¤Master gave you a thoughtful look.
为师年轻时，也曾认为剑终究只是外物而已，对自身并无太多提升。现在想来，当年的想法当真平庸至极。¤When I was young, I also thought that the sword was only an external object after all, and it didn't improve myself much. Thinking about it now, the idea back then was really mediocre.
辛苦了，此番可有遇到什么危险？¤You've worked hard, what danger is there this time?
况且修行又不是只有强弱之分，战斗之外的东西，师父都还没有说过…¤Moreover, cultivation is not only divided into strengths and weaknesses, and the master has not said anything other than combat...
…记得，不用浴火。¤...remember, don't bathe in fire.
你说什么？¤What did you say?
一向沉默寡言的师父突然话多了起来。虽然这些理论知识你以前或多或少都听说过，不过师尊还是又和你讲了一遍。¤The always taciturn master suddenly became more talkative. Although you have heard of these theoretical knowledge more or less before, Master still explained it to you again.
若是竭泽而渔，没了后劲，则会陷入被动。¤If you run out of water and fish, you will be passive.
总而言之，若使用水系功法神通，攻势则要生生不息、连绵不绝，不给敌人喘息之机。¤All in all, if you use the supernatural powers of water-based exercises, the offensive must be endless and continuous, so as not to give the enemy a chance to breathe.
你且记好…¤you remember...
罢了，你且听好…¤Forget it, listen up...
可以了。¤That's it.
师父点了点头，从储物袋中拿出了一枚丹药，递到了你的面前。¤Master nodded, took out an Pill from the storage bag, and handed it to you.
好！为师等着你的好消息。¤good! We are waiting for your good news.
若你对五行相生之法已领悟通透，则可以进修{color=#d0380a}元戎飞沙诀{/color}与{color=#d0380a}生生造化诀{/color}，两者皆是妙用无穷。¤If you have a thorough understanding of the law of the five elements, you can learn {color=#d0380a}Yuan Rong Feisha Art{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Life and Good Fortune{/color}, both of which are infinitely useful. .
原来如此…但师父为何要我出手？难道师父也觉得那妖王现在到了虚弱之际？¤That's right... But why did Master ask me to take action? Could it be that Master also thinks that the demon king is now weak?
一个周天后，师父点了点头。¤A week later, your master nodded their head.
师傅领进门，修行在个人。每个人都有属于自己的战斗方式，剩下的则要靠你自己判断了。¤The master leads their disciple to the door, but all cultivation is personal. Everyone has their own fighting style and the rest is up for you to decide.
金道讲究不破不立，大巧若拙。剑道讲究一力十惠，一招制敌。两者相得益彰。¤Jin Dao pays attention to neither breaking nor standing, and is skillful and clumsy. Kendo pays attention to one strength and ten benefits, and one move to defeat the enemy. The two complement each other perfectly.
眼看师父就要将那聚顶丹收回去，你眼疾手快便将它接了过来。¤Seeing that Master was about to take back the Juding Pill, you quickly took it over.
千万不要小看这护罩的作用，在引力状态下，任何行为都变得极其困难。¤Don't underestimate the role of this shield, in the state of Gravity, any behavior becomes extremely difficult.
不错，在筑基期之前就能领悟到小成的，无一不是悟性极高之人。看来为师这次收到了一个好苗子啊。¤That's right, those who can comprehend Xiaocheng before the foundation-building stage are all people with extremely high comprehension. It seems that the teacher has received a good seedling this time.
记住，修炼要沉得住气，不能心浮气躁。再下去练吧¤Remember, when cultivating you need to be calm and patient. Now, go practice.
这么简单的东西你都忘啦？¤Have you forgotten something so simple?
剑道、水道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，都可以帮你提升大道感悟。¤Kendo and Waterway are further subdivided into several schools. If you choose one of them, it can help you improve your Dao perception.
师父看了你一会，摇了摇头，便转身离开了。¤Master looked at you for a while, shook his head, then turned and left.
但若你判断有误，没能一举拿下对手，情况就大为不利了。¤But if you're wrong in your judgment and you don't take down your opponent in one fell swoop, it's a big disadvantage.
只是运气好一些罢了，实力跟师父相比，还远远不够呢。¤It's just that luck is a little bit better. Compared with the master, the strength is far from enough.
你一时竟不知如何回答，只得应了下来。¤You didn't know how to answer for a while, so you had to answer.
嗯…后会有期。¤Hmm... There will be a period later.
结丹的机会只有一次，过程更是千难万险。若是结成的金丹不超过五品，就算结成了金丹，也几乎与结婴无缘了。反之若品阶越高，日后的修炼便越容易，结婴、乃至化神飞升的可能性就越高。¤There is only one chance to form an Core, and the process is even more difficult. If the golden Core formed does not exceed five ranks, even if the golden Core is formed, it is almost impossible to form a Nascent Soul. Conversely, the higher the rank, the easier it will be to cultivate in the future, and the higher the possibility of conceiving a Nascent Soul or even reaching Deity Transformation.
师父，我的{$dadao}道已经略有小成了。¤Master, my {$dadao} Dao has reached slight accomplishment.
玄武丹？师父，你宁愿拿出一枚玄武丹都要我去，只怕不仅仅是考较我这么简单吧？¤Black Tortoisedan? Master, you'd rather take out a Black Tortoise Pill and ask me to go, I'm afraid it's not just as simple as me?
若你对土之道的理解已略有小成，可要好生感悟{color=#d0380a}引力{/color}之道。¤If your understanding of the way of earth has been somewhat successful, you should have a good understanding of the way of {color=#d0380a}gravitation{/color}.
土之道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤The Tao of the Earth is subdivided into several schools. You can choose one of them, and it will help you understand the Dao.
结丹的机会只有一次，过程更是千难万险。若想结出高品阶的金丹，你还需要寻觅一些突破用的丹药、秘术才行……¤There is only one chance to form an Pill, and the process is even more difficult. If you want to forge a high-grade Golden Core, you still need to look for some medicinal pills and secret techniques for breakthroughs...
徒儿明白了。¤The disciple understood.
这次找你是想让你去除掉一只在{$kaoyandidian}的筑基巅峰妖王。¤I'm looking for you this time to get you to get rid of a base-building peak demon king in {$kaoyandidian}.
不错，出手吧。¤Good, let's go.
……师父莫急，我待我休整之后定能除掉那妖王。¤...Master, don't worry, I will be able to get rid of the demon king after I rest.
灼烧流门槛较高，其发力在金丹期。所以本派没有人阶的灼烧功法，只有地阶功法才够资格窥其皮毛。¤The threshold of burning flow is higher, and its power is in the golden core stage. Therefore, there is no human-level scorching technique in this sect, and only earth-level techniques are qualified to peek at its fur.
……我已经没东西教你了。¤...I have nothing to teach you.
一个周天后，师父摇了摇头。¤A week later, your master shook their head.
师尊上前拍了拍你的肩膀，便转身离开了。¤Master stepped forward and patted you on the shoulder, then turned and left.
只是…？¤only…?
你…可明白？¤You... understand?
但如果敌人也注重防守，这功法恐怕就讨不到好处了。¤But if the enemy also pays attention to defense, I am afraid that this method will not be beneficial.
师尊又像往常一样，语气略显木讷，却又极为细心地说教了你一通。¤Master is as usual, his tone is a little dull, but he is very careful to teach you a lesson.
话虽如此，但对于这种机缘有个不成文的规矩，每个长老只有一次机会出手，一次不得便不能再出手了。¤Having said that, there is an unwritten rule for this kind of opportunity, each elder has only one chance to make a move, and he can't make another move if he has to.
你这还差得远呐。¤You are still far from here.
本门主修剑道，但也需辅修水道。¤This school majors in kendo, but also needs to minor in water.
火道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤Fire Road is subdivided into several genres. You can choose one of them, and it will help you understand the Dao.
相信你之前便已经参阅过了问水剑典，修习了惊涛剑诀与柔水无痕，对“惊涛”、“止水”已经有一定认知了。¤I believe that you have already read the Sword of Questioning Water before, practiced the Sword Art of Tidal Wave and Soft Water, and already have a certain understanding of Tidal Wave and Stopping Water.
你初来乍到，为师且试试你的深浅罢。¤You are new here, as a teacher and try your depth.
总的来说，水剑一派相当灵活多变。你要是运用得当，想挑战比自己境界更高的人也并非不可能。¤In general, the Water Sword faction is quite flexible and changeable. If you use it properly, it is not impossible to challenge people who are higher than yourself.
敌人所受到的影响越多，战斗也就对你越有利。¤The more the enemy is affected, the better the battle will be in your favor.
徒儿都记住了。¤The disciples all remembered.
结果这妖王实力却远超寻常筑基期水平。他那弟子便铩羽而归了。¤As a result, the strength of this demon king is far beyond the level of the ordinary foundation-building stage. His disciple then returned home.
一向开朗的师父，竟突地显得失落了起来。一时间，你不知所措。¤The always cheerful master suddenly seemed lost. For a time, you are at a loss.
徒儿将五柳根带来了。¤The disciple brought the five willow roots.
况且，此前向你询问的五柳根，本来也是为了给你炼聚顶丹所用的。¤Moreover, the five willow roots that I asked you about before were originally used for refining the Juding Pill for you.
知道就好，你可别得意忘形。我要是用上全力，你肯定不是我的对手。¤It's good to know, but don't get carried away. If I use all my strength, you are definitely not my opponent.
你害怕师父一生气又给你拍一下，一溜烟便跑了出去。¤You are afraid that the master will shoot you again when he is angry, and run out in a flash.
徒儿不必多礼。¤Disciple need not be too polite.
其他事情，你不用操心。¤You don't have to worry about other things.
就算你提升了境界，若功法神通还停留在之前的水平，水平也就强上一线罢了……¤Even if you have improved your realm, if the magical powers of the exercises remain at the previous level, the level will be stronger than the first line...
不过，你可不能满足于如今的境界。¤However, you can not be satisfied with the current state.
师父从储物袋中拿出了一枚丹药，递到了你的面前。¤Master took out an Pill from the storage bag and handed it to you.
只见师尊负手而立，俨然一副高人架势。¤I saw Shizun standing with his hands behind his back, just like an expert posture.
百花流的功法神通搭配，自然是以百花齐放为首。¤Hundred Flowers Flow's combination of magic and magical powers is naturally led by the blooming of hundreds of flowers.
而舍剑气，专剑伤，正所谓金道之不破不立，实乃点睛之笔。¤But giving up the Sword Qi and focusing on the sword injury, as the so-called golden road is not broken and not established, is really the finishing touch.
虽然是筑基巅峰妖王，但你也是我弟子中的佼佼者。¤Although you are the Demon King at the peak of Foundation Establishment, you are also the best among my disciples.
修炼需持之以恒，切忌心浮气躁。¤Cultivation requires perseverance and must not be impetuous.
练成了没？¤Have you finished practicing the skill yet?
这还差不多。你都快要结丹了，还跟为师客气，简直不像话。¤That's more or less. You are about to form an Pill, and you are polite to your teacher, which is simply outrageous.
弟子明白。¤This discple understands.
你按照修炼时的路线运起功法来，不一会便进入了状态。¤You start running the exercise according to the route your practiced.
练的怎么样了？¤How's your practice going?
其次便是要合理运用自身灵气。只有懂得保存力量，持续发力，才能发挥出水灵妙法最大的威力。¤The second is to use your own spiritual energy rationally. Only by knowing how to preserve the power and continue to exert it can the greatest power of the water magic method be exerted.
冰魄经是本门冰系的成名功法，其旨在先御敌，后破敌。¤The Ice Soul Sutra is a famous practice of the ice system of this sect. It aims to defend the enemy first, and then defeat the enemy.
如今你已结丹，我已不是你师父。¤Now that you have formed Pill, I am no longer your master.
其中利弊，你且好好权衡。¤You have to weigh the pros and cons.
总言之，缠绕流攻守兼备，至于如何攻守，则要看个人取舍。¤All in all, entanglement is both offensive and defensive. As for how to attack and defend, it depends on individual choices.
收下。¤accept.
师尊¤Master
来，出手罢。¤Come, let's go.
师父为你详细地讲解了一番对大道的理解。¤Master gave you a detailed explanation of the Dao.
若你实力不济，服下这枚补灵丹，确保万无一失。¤If you are not strong enough, take this supplement to make sure you are safe.
对敌时需持续向敌人注入灼烧灵气，不可急于求成。¤When fighting the enemy, you need to continuously inject the burning aura into the enemy, and you can't be in a hurry.
师父略显惊讶地看着你。¤The master looked at you slightly surprised.
师父笑了笑。¤The master smiled.
金道、剑道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤Jindao and Kendo are further subdivided into several schools. You can choose one of them, and it will help you understand the Dao.
恭喜。¤Congratulations.
你与师父又论道了一番，尽管理解仍不如师父，却能令他刮目相看。¤You and Master discussed the Dao again, and although your understanding was still not as good as Master's, you were able to impress him with admiration.
其悟道核心在于{color=#d0380a}盘根{/color}，你需勤加感悟，否则无法施展缠绕流真正威力。¤The core of its enlightenment lies in {color=#d0380a}Tanggen{/color}. You need to be diligent in understanding, otherwise you will not be able to use the true power of the entanglement flow.
若你对五行相生之道理解通透了，便可进修{color=#d0380a}金翎托天功{/color}，其中招式变化万千，要灵活运用绝非易事。¤If you have a thorough understanding of the way the five elements interact, you can study the {color=#d0380a}Golden Ling Tuo Tian Gong{/color}. The moves are varied, and it is not easy to use them flexibly.
你明白了吗？¤Do you understand it?
怕什么？又不是金丹期，你去打他绰绰有余。¤What are you afraid of? It's not the Golden Core period, it's more than enough for you to beat him.
没什么没什么…¤nothing nothing...
不要骄躁，慢慢来吧。¤Don't be arrogant, take your time.
这筑基巅峰妖王本应是我们要出手解决的问题，但师兄夸下海口说，让他门下弟子出手，便可除掉这妖王。¤This base-building peak demon king was supposed to be a problem that we wanted to solve, but the senior brother boasted to Haikou that he could get rid of this demon king by letting his disciples take action.
你可听明白了？¤Do you understand?
{$kaoyandidian}有一筑基巅峰妖王，你去将它除掉。¤{$kaoyandidian} There is a base-building peak demon king, you go and get rid of it.
用此神剑诀，便要一鼓作气，先发制人。若是进入持久战，则会陷入被动。¤With this Divine Sword Art, you have to make a big effort to strike first. If you enter a protracted war, you will fall into passive.
其旨在将“尘”转换为“沙”，以细沙伤敌。¤Its purpose is to convert dust into sand to injure the enemy with fine sand.
师父微笑着回头看了你一眼，便径直离开了。¤Master smiled and looked back at you, then left.
本门主修剑道，但也需辅修金道。¤This school majors in Kendo, but also needs to minor in Jindao.
本门主修火道，但运用五行相生之法，所以金、木、水、土道也需了解一二，尤其是木道。¤This school focuses on the fire path, but uses the method of the five elements of mutual generation, so the metal, wood, water, and earth paths also need to know a thing or two, especially the wood path.
故而为师的防御神通{color=#d0380a}紫莲金影罩{/color}当是首选。¤The defensive magic {color=#d0380a} purple lotus golden shadow cover {/color} is the first choice.
师父就这样离开了，什么都没有发生。¤The master just left, nothing happened.
师父向你点了点头。¤The master nodded to you.
但若是不能一鼓作气，一举击溃敌人，则会陷入被动。¤But if you can't do it all at once and defeat the enemy in one fell swoop, you will fall into passive.
很好，很好…以后你若还有想问为师的，便再来找我罢。¤Very good, very good... If you still want to ask about being a teacher in the future, you can come to me again.
剑道讲究破釜沉舟，否极泰来。水道讲究静如止水，动若惊涛，进退自如。¤Kendo pays attention to breaking the cauldron and sinking the boat, whether it is extremely peaceful. The waterway should be as still as still water, moving like a turbulent wave, advancing and retreating freely.
混元引气诀乃引力流基础功法。¤Hunyuan Qi Entrainment Art is the basic method of gravitational flow.
师父没有多说话，直接出手向你攻来。¤The master didn't say much, and directly attacked you.
这个…我猜是师弟看那妖王已与人交过手，便以为它正处虚弱之际，再加上对大弟子实力的自信，方才有了这一幕。¤This... I guess it was the younger brother who saw that the demon king had already fought with people, and thought that it was at a time of weakness, and coupled with the confidence in the strength of the eldest disciple, this scene came about.
没，就只是路过看看师父……¤No, just passing by to see Master...
若想掌握九冲图集，首先要理解的便是五行相生之道。若熟练掌握水生木的生灵之道，便可百花齐放。¤If you want to master the Jiuchong Atlas, the first thing you need to understand is the way of the five elements. If you master the way of life of aquatic wood, a hundred flowers can bloom.
哈哈哈哈，你猜师弟为什么要派他的大弟子去，而不亲自前往？¤Hahahaha, guess why the junior disciple sent his eldest disciple instead of going there in person?
听了你的话，师父紧皱的眉头似乎松动了。¤Hearing your words, Master's frown seemed to loosen.
万象寄生诀乃缠绕流基础功法。¤Infinite Parasitism is the basic technique of using Tangle.
不错不错，为师就喜欢你这性子。¤Not bad, I like your temperament as a teacher.

既然已经有前人踩过坑了，为何还要重蹈覆辙？¤Since some predecessors have stepped on the pit, why repeat the same mistakes?
若你对气道通透，可修习{color=#d0380a}少阳诀{/color}或{color=#d0380a}紫阳混元劲{/color}，补充自身灵气。¤If you are clear about the airway, you can practice {color=#d0380a}Shaoyang Art{/color} or {color=#d0380a}Ziyang Hunyuan Jin{/color} to replenish your spiritual energy.
你悟道尚浅，当务之急还是要提升自己对大道的感悟。¤Your understanding of the Dao is still shallow, and the most urgent task is to improve your understanding of the Dao.
这个…徒儿此前已经用掉了…¤This... disciple has already used it before...
说罢，师父便不再开口了。你也不知道师父究竟有没有说完。一时间，二人竟面面相觑，愣在原地。数息过后，师父又开了口。¤After saying that, the master stopped talking. You don't even know if Master has finished speaking. For a time, the two of them looked at each other, stunned in place. After a few breaths, the master spoke again.
以后若是有哪里不明白的，可随时找为师论道。¤If there is something you don't understand in the future, you can always ask a teacher to discuss the Tao.
此外，若没有足够纯净的水系灵根，使用冰系神通也是举步维艰，因此领悟{color=#d0380a}黑水真法{/color}也至关重要。¤In addition, if there is not enough pure water-type spiritual roots, it will be difficult to use ice-type magical powers, so it is also very important to understand the {color=#d0380a}black water true method{/color}.
引力流之功法神通搭配，自然是围绕引力做文章。¤The combination of gravitational flow and magical powers naturally revolves around Gravity.
筑基巅峰妖王岂是我一个人能战胜的？师父，你确定这里面没有出什么问题？¤Can I defeat the Demon King at the peak of the Foundation Establishment alone? Master, are you sure there is nothing wrong here?
需要注意的是，若你火道已感悟到小成，{color=#d0380a}吞焰{/color}一定要好好参悟，记住了。¤It should be noted that, if you have realized Xiaocheng in the Fire Dao, {color=#d0380a}Swallowing Flame{/color} must comprehend it, remember.
本门主修木道，但运用五行相生之法，所以金、水、火、土道也需了解一二，尤其是水道。¤This school mainly focuses on the way of wood, but uses the method of mutual generation of the five elements, so the way of metal, water, fire, and earth also needs to know a thing or two, especially the way of water.
这……徒儿不知。¤This... disciples don't know.
师父，徒儿收下还不成嘛…¤Master, it's not enough to accept the disciple...
{color=#d0380a}缠木诀{/color}乃缠绕流基础神通，可有效困敌。¤{color=#d0380a}Wood Wrapping Technique{/color} is the basic magical power of wrapping flow, which can effectively trap the enemy.
{color=#d0380a}化尘真诀{/color}乃是化尘教真正的核心，化尘诀便是为了给炼气期修士修习的它的简化版本。¤The {color=#d0380a}True Art of Dispelling Dust{/color} is the true core of the Dispelling Cult.
这样一来，本门的核心功法便能传授于你了。¤In this way, the core exercises of this sect can be taught to you.
金道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤Jin Dao is subdivided into several genres. You can choose one of them, and it will help you understand the Dao.
呵呵，他们失败终究只能归结于准备不足，冒冒失失的当然成不了气候。¤Hehe, their failure can only be attributed to lack of preparation after all, and of course rashness will not make the climate.
你像这样练至第三层，本门的核心你便大致掌握了，到时候再来找我罢。¤If you practice to the third floor like this, you will have a general grasp of the core of this sect. Come to me when the time comes.
要掌握叠焰诀，首先要理解的便是五行相生之道。若在使用火系神通前先调用木系灵气，便可使你的火焰威力倍增。¤To master the stacking flame art, the first thing to understand is the way of the five elements. If you use the wood-type aura before using the fire-type supernatural power, you can double the power of your fire.
任务的报酬只是一个名分罢了，无关紧要。¤The reward for the task is just a title, it doesn't matter.
若你灵根不纯，{color=#d0380a}焰灵招徕{/color}也能将其他属性的灵气转换为火系灵气伤敌，若能熟练使用也是威力不俗。¤If your spiritual roots are impure, {color=#d0380a}Flame Spirit Invocation{/color} can also convert other attribute Qi into Fire-type Qi to damage the enemy.
就筑基期而言，为师所自创的{color=#d0380a}青蛇劲{/color}与{color=#d0380a}青蛇要诀{/color}乃是最为高效的方法。¤As far as the foundation stage is concerned, the {color=#d0380a}Green Snake Strength{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Green Snake Tips{/color} created by your master are the most efficient methods.
本门虽说主修火道，但其实气道也必不可少，在实战中阵道也相当有用。¤Although this sect majors in Fire Dao, Qi Dao is also essential, and formation Dao is also quite useful in actual combat.
水剑神通中最难以理解的，当属{color=#d0380a}刚柔并济{/color}。你要是能把这个招式运用得巧妙，我对你也就放心了。¤The most incomprehensible among the water sword supernatural powers is {color=#d0380a}the combination of rigidity and softness{/color}. If you can use this move skillfully, I will be at ease with you.
这玄土丹可保你土系灵气充裕，生生不息。有此丹药，想必那妖王也不在话下吧。¤This Profound Earth Pill can keep your Earth Element aura full and endless. With this Pill, the demon king must be no problem.
好说，好说。我还有事，便先走一步了。¤Well said, well said. I have something to do, so I'll go ahead.
听到你的试探，师父不仅没有生气，反倒是笑了起来。¤Hearing your temptation, not only did the master not get angry, but he laughed.
积沙可以成塔，积土可以成山。土之道的精髓在于厚重。¤The accumulation of sand can form a tower, and the accumulation of soil can form a mountain. The quintessence of the Tao of the Earth lies in its thickness.
师父的语气不容置疑，你疑迟了一下，还是接过了这枚丹药。¤Master's tone is unquestionable, you hesitated for a while, but still took the medicine pill.
又寒暄了几句后，你二人便分别了。还未等你细想，又有新的长老过来恭贺，如此反复。¤After a few more greetings, the two of you parted. Before you can think about it, a new elder came to congratulate you, and so on.
呵呵呵呵，你可别答应的这么快，凡事都要三思而行。¤Hehehe, don't promise so quickly, you have to think twice about everything.
为师忙的很，你快回去修炼罢。¤You are very busy for the teacher, you should go back to practice quickly.
较为复杂的，要结合金道之冲穴的原理，再配合神通{color=#d0380a}纵地金光{/color}便可快速治疗内伤。¤To be more complicated, it is necessary to combine the principle of Jin Dao's Chong acupoint, and then cooperate with the magical {color=#d0380a}vertical golden light{/color} to quickly treat internal injuries.
好，若你以后还有什么疑问，尽管来问我罢。¤Well, if you have any questions in the future, feel free to ask me.
乾坤化剑诀是为师精通水剑之后，自创的功法。虽然说不上特别厉害，但能助你更好地理解水剑的奥义。¤The Qiankun Huajian Jue is a self-created practice after mastering the water sword. Although it is not particularly powerful, it can help you better understand the profound meaning of the water sword.
总言之，蓄势一派需持之以恒、日积月累，没有讨巧的方法。¤All in all, gaining momentum requires perseverance and accumulation over time, and there is no easy way.
来来来，让为师看看你现在是什么水平了。¤Come, come, let the teacher see what level you are now.
就这筑基期的喽啰还需要为师出手？你不嫌丢人为师还嫌丢人。¤Do you still need to take action for the teacher in this foundation-building period? You are not ashamed to be a teacher or ashamed.
此外，{color=#d0380a}沙葬{/color}作为化沙的核心神通，与化尘另外一大功法基石{color=#d0380a}五藏炼尘功{/color}也有配合，需熟练掌握。¤In addition, {color=#d0380a}sand burial{/color}, as the core supernatural power of sand melting, also cooperates with the other great foundation stone of the dust transformation {color=#d0380a}Five Tibetan Dust Cultivation Technique{/color}, which requires proficiency master.
罢了罢了，你下去吧。¤That's it, you go down.
五毒蚀心诀乃毒道基础功法，能在不经意间给敌人种下木毒。¤Heart Corroding Venom is a basic technique for the way of poison, which can accumulate poison on an opponent.
这个的确很难领悟。¤This is really hard to comprehend.
感悟如何？¤How do you feel?
…是。¤…Yes.
不必留手，出招罢。¤Don't hold back, move on.
这聚顶丹便是此次任务的报酬，你拿着吧。¤This Juding Pill is the reward for this mission, you can take it.
师傅将信将疑地看了你一眼。¤The master looked at you with suspicion.
约莫一个时辰过后，长老们都一一拜谢过了，你才得以抽身。¤After about an hour, the elders thanked them one by one, and you were able to withdraw.
师尊走了几步，笑着回头看了你一眼，便唤出飞剑，踏剑离开了。¤Master took a few steps, looked back at you with a smile, called out Feijian, stepped on the sword and left.
师父又像往常一样给你说教了一番。¤The master lectured you again as usual.
唉……你果然还是领悟不通，¤Alas...you really still don't understand,
你需要用各种手段骚扰、迷惑、伤到敌人，以达到制敌的效果。¤You need to use various means to harass, confuse, and hurt the enemy to achieve the effect of defeating the enemy.
此道不再注重“尘”与“沙”之间的变换，而是注重天地法则，并加以运用。¤This Tao no longer pays attention to the transformation between dust and sand, but pays attention to the laws of heaven and earth and applies them.
你将化沙、还尘使用的越是娴熟，凝沙诀的威力便越是明显。¤The more skillful you are at melting sand and Return Dust, the more powerful the Sand Condensing Art will be.
师尊详细地给你讲解了{$dadao}道感悟。¤Master explained to you the insight of {$dadao} Dao in detail.
这还没完，师弟看到这一幕，也派出大弟子前去除妖，回来的时候更是头破血流，狼狈不堪。¤This is not over yet, when the younger brother saw this scene, he also sent the eldest disciple to remove the demon.
悟道乃水滴石穿，功到自然，切莫急功近利。¤Enlightenment is like a drop of water and a stone penetrates the stone, and it is natural to do it. Don't be in a hurry for quick success.
哈哈哈哈，不错，这才像我徒弟！¤Hahahaha, yes, this is like my apprentice!
只见师父从储物袋中拿出了一枚丹药，扔到了你的面前。¤I saw the master took out an Pill from the storage bag and threw it in front of you.
起码得{$dadao}道小成之后，才算打牢了根基。届时再说功法神通的事吧。¤You should at least increase your {$dadao} Dao to the Small Success stage, only then can you be considered to have one step into the Dao. At that time you can gain a divine ability from it.
要掌握水灵妙法，首先要理解的便是五行相生之道。若在使用水系神通前先调用金系灵气，便可使水流化江河，生生不息。¤To master the water spirit, the first thing to understand is the way of the five elements. If you use the gold-type aura before using the water-type supernatural powers, you can make the water flow into the river, and it will continue to grow.
完全不行。¤Not even close.
哈哈哈哈哈，好！为师就知道那妖王不是你的对手。¤Hahahaha, good! As a teacher, you know that the demon king is not your opponent.
不过水剑的奥义可不止这么点，你要学的东西还多着呢。¤However, the profound meaning of the water sword is more than that, there are still many things you need to learn.
本门主修金道，但也需辅修剑道。¤This school majors in Jin Dao, but also needs to minor in kendo.
另外，{color=#d0380a}怒涛诀{/color}可使怒涛更具威力。{color=#d0380a}滥觞{/color}则可助你更好的运用灵气，若你气道能领悟到融会贯通之{color=#d0380a}储海{/color}，那更是绝佳。¤In addition, {color=#d0380a}Raging Waves Technique{/color} can make Raging Waves more powerful. {color=#d0380a}Original{/color} can help you make better use of your aura. If you can comprehend the {color=#d0380a}storing ocean{/color} of integration, it will be even better.
感悟土之道需要大量积累，筑基期只能窥其皮毛，只有金丹期方可登堂入室。¤It takes a lot of accumulation to comprehend the Tao of the Earth. Only in the foundation-building stage can you glimpse its skin, and only in the Jindan stage can you enter the hall.
好，徒儿定不负师尊厚望。¤Well, the disciple will definitely live up to the high expectations of the master.
境界不稳，气息不畅。¤The realm is unstable, and the breath is not smooth.
不过用此法需要极为精纯的木灵根，若木灵根不够精纯，则必须修习{color=#d0380a}万木诀{/color}才行。¤However, using this method rquires extremely pure spiritual roots so that you attract more wood qi, if your roots are not pure enough you must practice the {color=#d0380a}Ten Thousand Wood Technique{/color}.
你现在还差得远呐，得先从基础悟道修起。¤You are still a long way off, you have to start with basic enlightenment and cultivation.
这可就说来话长了。¤This is a long story.
怕自然是不会，师父尽管出手罢。¤I'm afraid that naturally it won't work, so Master can do it anyway.
在霜冻灵气逐渐开始奏效后，敌人受到内伤之后，{color=#d0380a}玄冰刺{/color}便能在注入霜冻灵气的同时，加速对方的内伤，乃是进攻的不二之选。¤After the Frost Aura gradually began to take effect, and after the enemy suffered internal injuries, the {color=#d0380a}Bing Bing Thorn{/color} could inject the Frost Aura while accelerating the opponent's internal injury, which was the best choice for attacking.
你既已突破了到了如今境界，便与为师较量一二罢。¤Since you have broken through to the current state, let’s compete with your teacher for a or two.
活着回来？那说明伤势已经很严重了吧？¤come back alive? Does that mean the injury is serious?
要你去你就去，怎么废话那么多？¤If you want to go, you can go, why is there so much nonsense?
哈哈哈哈，不错，心性可嘉。¤Hahahaha, good, a commendable temperament.
若你对土之道的理解已略有小成，{color=#d0380a}归尘{/color}可要好好感悟。¤If your understanding of the Tao of the Earth has been slightly improved, {color=#d0380a}Guichen{/color} may want to have a good understanding.
师父略显不耐烦地听完了你的感悟。¤The master listened to your insights a little impatiently.
妖王？师父，这应该不是我能独自解决得了的吧…¤Demon King? Master, this shouldn't be something I can handle alone...
“惊涛”、“止水”所对应的其实便是攻守、进退之道。只有敌攻我守，敌退我进，才能发挥乾坤化剑诀的威能。¤Shocking waves and stopping water actually correspond to the way of offense and defense, advance and retreat. Only when the enemy attacks and we defend, and the enemy retreats and we advance, can the power of the Qiankun Transformation Sword Art be exerted.
时白帝兴起，气宗盛行。我则偏要逆浪而行，舍弃剑气，注重剑本身的威力。功成之后，可断水摧山，我欲发扬之光大，故而立此剑宗。¤When the White Emperor rose, Qi Zong prevailed. I prefer to go against the tide, abandon the sword energy, and focus on the power of the sword itself. After the success, I can cut off the water and destroy the mountain. I want to carry forward the glory, so I established this sword sect.
不错，除了考较你之外，为师也与其他几个师兄弟玩了一场游戏。¤Yes, in addition to testing you, my teacher also played a game with several other brothers and sisters.
这妖王果真有这么厉害？¤Is this demon king really that powerful?
是，徒儿明白。¤Yes, the disciple understands.
师父的表情略显阴沉。¤The master's expression was slightly gloomy.
总的来说，叠焰流最好一鼓作气击溃对手。但若没有得手，你必须冷静下心来积蓄力量。如果贸然进攻，定然是收效甚微。¤In general, the stack of flames is best to crush the opponent in one go. But if you don't succeed, you must calm down and gather strength. If you attack rashly, it will definitely have little effect.
若你对木之道的理解已略有小成，可要好生感悟{color=#d0380a}封喉{/color}之道，莫要怠慢。¤If you've understood the Dao of Wood, you should at least learn the divine ability{color=#d0380a} Seal the Throat{/color}.
本门主修土道，准确的说是土道中的引力之道。¤This sect specializes in earth roads, which is precisely the way of Gravity in earth roads.
五藏炼尘功乃化尘教两大功法基石之一。¤Wuzang Chenchen Gong is one of the two cornerstones of the Chenhua Cult.
师父的这句话让你愣在了原地。你能感受到师父在替你高兴的同时，又有所顾虑，一时间竟不知说何是好。¤Master's words left you stunned. You can feel that while Master is happy for you, at the same time he has concerns, and for a while you don't know what to say.
此番除妖，也算是为为师完成了一个任务。这聚顶丹，你收下吧。¤This time to eliminate the demon, it can be regarded as a task for the teacher. This Judingdan, you accept it.
这都打不过，以后要是遇到魔修，怎么自保？¤I can't beat this. If I encounter a evil cultivator in the future, how can I protect myself?
哎，你这榆木脑袋。¤Hey, you elm head.
所以除开五行相生，规避内伤的副作用则是重中之重。较为简单的，你只需习得{color=#d0380a}通穴{/color}便可以治疗内伤。¤Therefore, in addition to the mutual development of the five elements, avoiding the side effects of internal injuries is the top priority. Relatively simple, you only need to learn {color=#d0380a}tong acupoints{/color} to heal internal injuries.
熔盾诀是化焰流的基础功法，以防御为主。¤The Shield Melting Technique is the basic technique of a Living Flame build, and it focuses on defense.
…谢师父。¤...Thank you, Master.
你初来乍到，究竟是深是浅，便由为师来检验一番吧。¤When you are new here, whether it is deep or shallow, let your teacher test it.
可有潜心修炼？¤Can you concentrate on practicing?
{color=#d0380a}离火绝炎{/color}能补充自身火系灵气，也可以配合悟道{color=#d0380a}浴火{/color}，你也需多加练习。¤{color=#d0380a}Li Huo Jueyan{/color} can replenish your own fire-type aura, and can also cooperate with enlightenment {color=#d0380a}Burning Fire{/color}, you also need to practice more.
你还是不确定师父到底还有没有要说的，犹豫了一会后才转身离开。而至始至终，师父都注视着你，直到你离开他的视野。¤You are still not sure if Master has anything else to say, you hesitated for a while before turning around and leaving. And from start to finish, the master watches you until you leave his sight.
本门主修木道，准确的说是毒之道。毒之道，需厚积薄发。¤This sect majors in the Dao of Wood, I focus on the Dao of Poison. The way of poison requires accumulation.
总的来说，引力流需先改变战场的引力，再使用威力较大的神通。若还拘泥于灵活的神通，则会得不偿失。¤In general, gravitational flow needs to change the gravitational force of the battlefield first, and then use the more powerful magical powers. If you still stick to flexible magical powers, you will lose more than you gain.
除战斗外，尽快突破到金丹期是关键。{color=#d0380a}龟息术{/color}、{color=#d0380a}紫阳混元劲{/color}等功法对修炼帮助极大，你若对气道有一定感悟，也可修此类功法。¤In addition to fighting, breaking through to the Golden Core Stage as soon as possible is the key. {color=#d0380a}Turtle Breath Technique{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Ziyang Hunyuanjin{/color} and other exercises are very helpful for cultivation. If you have a certain understanding of Qi Dao, you can also practice this Class exercises.
竟然……？¤it turns out……?
去吧。¤Go for it.
别废话，赶紧出招。¤Don't talk nonsense, move quickly.
可以。¤Can.
本门主修水道，但运用五行相生之法，所以金、木、火、土道也需了解一二，尤其是金道。除此之外，气道对于本门也至关重要。¤This school mainly focuses on the water way, but uses the method of the five elements to generate each other, so the way of metal, wood, fire and earth also needs to know a thing or two, especially the way of gold. In addition to this, the airway is also crucial for this door.
若你对五行相生之道理解通透了，便可进修{color=#d0380a}生生造化诀{/color}，保证防御无虞。¤If you have a thorough understanding of the way of mutual generation of the five elements, you can learn {color=#d0380a}Life and Good Fortune Tricks{/color} to ensure that your defense is safe.
之后再将其穴位冻住，造成内伤，敌人便会不攻自破。¤Then freeze its acupoints to cause internal injuries, and the enemy will be self-destructed without attacking.
结丹并非易事，唯一机会，必须要把握住……¤Forming a pill is not an easy task, the only opportunity must be seized...
其次便是要懂得积攒自身灵气，只有这样你才能在积攒足够的焰后，还留有灵气伤敌。¤The second is to know how to accumulate your own aura, only in this way can you accumulate enough flames and still have aura to damage the enemy.
需要注意的是，若你水道已感悟到小成，{color=#d0380a}冰冻{/color}一定要好好参悟，莫要荒废。¤It should be noted that if your waterway has realized Xiaocheng, {color=#d0380a}Frozen{/color} must be carefully realized and not abandoned.
果然是第三层，不过这倒也不算什么难事。¤Sure enough, you've reached the third stage. Although it's not that difficult.
一一道来罢。¤Come one by one.
你赢了…恭喜。¤You won...congratulations.
哈哈哈哈哈，好！为师现在竟然都不是你的对手了。¤Hahahahahahahaha, good! I can't believe that my master is not even a match for you now.
之所以要你出手，是因为我最为器重的弟子便是你，明白了吗？¤The reason why I want you to take action is because my most important disciple is you, understand?
冰系的功法神通搭配，须以控制为主。¤The combination of ice-type magic and supernatural powers must be based on control.
大殿上，往来恭贺的长老们络绎不绝。¤In the main hall, the elders who came and went to congratulate were in an endless stream.
五柳根，乃是突破金丹必不可少的药材，若有机会，大可留心搜集若干。¤Five willow roots are essential medicinal materials for breaking through the Golden Core. If you have the opportunity, you can carefully collect some.
去，这就去…¤go, go...
（小声嘟囔）去就去，怎么还打人…¤(Muttering in a low voice) Just go, why are you still beating people...
说说看。¤Tell me.
需要注意的是，你相生而出的神通消耗灵气越多，积攒的“尘”也就越多。¤It should be noted that the more magical powers you have created from each other consume more spiritual energy, the more dust you will accumulate.
要是你剑道、水道已经略有小成了，记得领悟{color=#d0380a}重剑{/color}与{color=#d0380a}止水{/color}，日后一定会派上用场的。¤If your swordsmanship and waterway have become a bit small, remember to understand {color=#d0380a}epee{/color} and {color=#d0380a}stop water{/color}, which will definitely come in handy in the future.
若敌人选择稳固防守，你就需要迅速积攒“势”来压制敌人。此时{color=#d0380a}重元无锋功{/color}则是不二之选，{color=#d0380a}金虹剑诀{/color}也可锦上添花。¤If the enemy chooses to defend firmly, you need to quickly accumulate potential to suppress the enemy. At this time, {color=#d0380a}Chongyuan Wufeng Gong{/color} is the best choice, and {color=#d0380a}Golden Rainbow Sword Art{/color} can also be the icing on the cake.
嗯…自信是好事，但这次的目标也非常危险。¤Well...confidence is good, but the goal this time is also very dangerous.
那…以后你还有想问为师的，就再来找我吧。再会啦。¤Then... in the future, if you still want to ask about being a teacher, come find me again. Bye bye.
此番除妖，也算是为为师完成了一个任务。这聚顶丹，你且收下。¤This time to eliminate the demon, it can be regarded as a task for the teacher. This Juding Pill, you accept it.
只是这样一来……我也没多少东西可以教你了，你也就可以出师了……¤It's just this way... I don't have much to teach you, and you can start teaching...
下去练吧，练到第三层再来找我。¤Go and practice, come back to me once you've cultivated this method to the third level.
通过五行相生叠有一定数量的“焰”后，我派杀招{color=#d0380a}爆燃{/color}的威力便能成倍提升。¤After stacking a certain number of ''Flaring'' through the five elements, the power of ultimate move {color=#d0380a}Combustion{/color} can be doubled.
九冲图集乃我宗秘术，乃是一本集大成于一体的功法。¤Jiuchong Atlas is a secret technique of our sect, and it is a collection of exercises.
师父的表情瞬间阴沉了下来。¤The master's expression instantly darkened.
不行。¤no.
所谓细水长流，就是每一次出招的同时积蓄力量，以达到生生不息的效果。这也是水灵妙法的奥义。¤The so-called long-lasting flow means that every time you make a move, you accumulate power to achieve the effect of endless growth. This is also the profound meaning of water magic.
哈哈哈哈，徒儿能成长到今天这一步，为师很是欣慰啊。¤Hahahaha, I am very pleased for the teacher to have grown up to this stage.
师傅领进门，修行在个人。每个人都有属于自己的战斗方式，剩下的就要靠你自己判断了。¤The master leads the door, and the practice is personal. Everyone has their own fighting style, the rest is up to you to judge.
有什么好看的，还不快去修炼。¤What's there to see? Hurry up and pratice...
这次考较，目标是一个筑基巅峰妖王。¤This time, the goal is to be a Demon King at the peak of the Foundation Establishment.
所以其要点在于如何拖得敌人与你进入缠斗，一旦进入持久战，你便能掌握主动。¤So the point is how to drag out the battle, eventually allowing you to take the initiative.
关键在于你结丹的问题。如今你已是筑基后期，需要提前为结丹做好准备了。¤The key is about your Golden Core formation. Now that you are already in the later stage of Foundation Establishment, you need to prepare in advance for the formation of the Golden Core.
你可明白？¤Do you understand?
其次，便是与能增强剑伤威力的功法神通相配合，例如{color=#d0380a}破势{/color}、{color=#d0380a}金虹剑诀{/color}。在习得这些神通之前，也可用{color=#d0380a}金芒术{/color}过度。¤Secondly, skills can be used in tandem to enhance the power of sword injuries, such as {color=#d0380a}Breaking Through{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Radiant Sword Skill{/color}. Before learning these supernatural powers, you can also overuse {color=#d0380a}Golden Ray{/color} if you wish。
现在，为师已自创出了一套更高效的毒道功法神通与打法，不过这些就是后话了。¤Now, your master has created a set of more efficient exercises, techniques and fighting methods but these will come later. This is enough for you at this point.
除此之外，{color=#d0380a}聚尘诀{/color}可聚起你被引力影响所消散的灵气，化为“尘”收集起来，其辅助效果也是绝佳。¤In addition, the {color=#d0380a}Dust Gathering Technique{/color} can gather the aura that has been dissipated by the gravitational influence, turn it into dust and collect it, and its auxiliary effect is also excellent.
敌人若想致胜，就必须先击破这护盾，可如此一来，敌人所受到的伤害也就越大，正所谓以守代攻。¤If the enemy wants to win, he must first break the shield, but in this way, the enemy will suffer more damage, as the so-called defense instead of offense.
那就好…¤That's good…
哈哈哈哈，好！竟然已经领悟到小成了。¤Hahahahahaha, good! I can't believe I've already comprehended a small success.
还不快去？¤Why don't you go soon?
不过你要是心急进攻，没能控制住场面，则会陷入被动。¤However, if you are anxious to attack and fail to control the scene, you will fall into passive.
那…便恭敬不如从命了。¤Then... it would be better to be respectful than to obey.
总的来说，灼烧流重积累，不管是战斗上还是修炼上都是如此。¤In general, the burning flow is heavy accumulation, whether it is in combat or in practice.
听了你的话，师父的眉头慢慢舒展开来，反倒是笑了起来。¤After listening to your words, Master's brows slowly stretched out, but instead he laughed.
本门主修火道，气道、体道、阵道也可辅修。¤This sect majors in Fire Dao, and can also minor in Qi Dao, Body Dao, and Formation Dao.
她微红着脸颊，将头转向一边，眼睛也不知看向了何方。¤She blushed slightly and turned her head to one side, her eyes not knowing where to look.
师父点了点头。¤The master nodded.
悟道可没这么简单，急不得。回去再好好琢磨琢磨吧。¤Enlightenment is not that simple, so there is no rush. Go back and think about it.
其旨在通过五行相生之法来快速凝聚“尘”，达到积沙成塔的效果。¤Its purpose is to quickly condense dust through the method of mutual generation of five elements, so as to achieve the effect of accumulating sand into a tower.
为师最后点拨你一番，你听好了。¤I will give you some final pointers, so listen up.
{FirstName}{shidi}，恭喜了。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, congratulations.
师父给了你一记爆栗。¤The master gave you a burst of chestnuts.
若这些功法都修习过了，{color=#d0380a}象甲功{/color}与{color=#d0380a}元戎飞沙诀{/color}也颇有用处，值得参悟一番。¤If you have practiced these exercises, {color=#d0380a}Elephant Armor Technique{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Yuan Rong Feisha Technique{/color} are also very useful, and they are worth comprehending.
运一个周天。¤Ship a week.
这些你务必要多多感悟，以后都会有用到的时候。¤You must learn more about these, and you will use them in the future.
功法神通，也稍欠火候……¤The magical power of the practice method, but also a little bit of heat...
不过就算你打赢了我也不能自满，这修真界比我厉害的人比比皆是，更有很多强大的妖兽……¤But even if you win, I can't be complacent, there are people who are more powerful than me in this world of self-cultivation, and there are many powerful monsters...
哈哈哈哈，你倒是聪明。¤Hahahaha, you are smart.
此外，你需要修习水剑真正的核心神通{color=#d0380a}怒水天殇{/color}与{color=#d0380a}静水无波{/color}。它们搭配乾坤化剑诀，可谓是妙用无穷。¤In addition, you need to practice the true core supernatural powers of the water sword {color=#d0380a}Raging Water and Heavenly Sorrow{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Still Water Without Waves{/color}. They are paired with the Qiankun Transformation Sword Art, which can be said to be infinitely useful.
水道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤The waterway is subdivided into several genres. You can choose one of them, and it will help you understand the Dao.
“原来如此，想不到师尊的心思竟这么细腻…”¤It turns out that, I didn't expect the master's mind to be so delicate...
等到你觉得时机成熟，便可使用{color=#d0380a}聚焰{/color}配合{color=#d0380a}焰灵招徕{/color}一举拿下对手。¤When you feel the time is right, you can use {color=#d0380a}Gathering Flame{/color} in conjunction with {color=#d0380a}Flame Spirit Invocation{/color} to take down the opponent in one fell swoop.
需要注意的是，若你火道已感悟到小成，{color=#d0380a}浴火{/color}一定要好好参悟，莫要荒废。¤It should be noted that if you have realized the small success of the Fire Dao, {color=#d0380a}Burning Fire{/color} must study it carefully, and don’t let it go to waste.
那妖王就在{$kaoyandidian}，你是我最为器重的弟子，可别给我搞砸了。¤That demon king is at {$kaoyandidian}, you are my most important disciple, don't screw me up.
再者，剑宗讲究一鼓作气，灵气的爆发也是相当重要，故而{color=#d0380a}纵地金光{/color}与{color=#d0380a}刺穴{/color}也是不二之选。¤Furthermore, Sword Sect pays attention to one-shot, and the explosion of aura is also very important, so {color=#d0380a}Golden Light{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Stabbed{/color} are also the best choices.
纯粹的攻防也需要纯粹的灵根作为支撑。若你灵根不纯，则需要修炼{color=#d0380a}天晶诀{/color}，否则也是寸步难行。¤Pure attack and defense also need pure spiritual roots as support. If your spiritual roots are impure, you need to practice the {color=#d0380a}Sky Crystal Art{/color}, otherwise it will be difficult to move.
{color=#d0380a}红莲业焱{/color}是本派最基础的灼烧神通，一定要熟练掌握。¤{color=#d0380a}Red Lotus Yeyan{/color} is the most basic burning supernatural power of this sect, and it must be mastered proficiently.
原来如此…竟还有这一层考量在内…¤It turned out to be the case... There is actually this layer of consideration...
有何疑问？¤Questions?
罢了罢了，若实在不敌，就服下这玄武丹，这样应该就万无一失了。¤That's all, if it is really lost, just take this Black Tortoise Pill, so it should be foolproof.
说来听听。¤Oh? Let's test that.
理解还是不够。¤Understanding is still not enough.
水、气道又细分为若干流派。你任选其中一门，皆可助你感悟大道。¤Water and airway are further subdivided into several schools. You can choose one of them, and it will help you understand the Dao.
心性可嘉。¤Admirable heart.
等你对{$dadao}道的感悟略有小成之后，才算是打牢了根基，届时为师再教你本门的核心功法。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good understanding of the {$dadao} path, and then you will have a solid foundation, and then I will teach you the core techniques of the sect.
看来我已经没有什么东西可以教你了。¤It seems that I have nothing left to teach you.
你木灵根越精纯，其效果便越好。¤The purer your wood spirit root, the better its effect.
要，要！师父的一片好意我怎么会不领情呢？之前那不是客套一下嘛…¤Want, want! How could I not appreciate Master's kindness? Wasn't that polite before...
见过师父。¤I saw the master.
接下来，为师就可以教你点真家伙了。¤Next, as your master, I can teach you some real moves.
一般剑系神通可体现不出振剑的真正威力，但若是配合{color=#d0380a}破釜沉舟{/color}，就会变得进退自如。¤Ordinary sword-type supernatural powers can't reflect the true power of the vibrating sword, but if it is combined with {color=#d0380a}breaking the boat{/color}, it will become easy to advance and retreat.
{color=#d0380a}回春诀{/color}能弥补毒道防御不足的缺点，也是上佳之选。¤{color=#d0380a}Rejuvenation Technique{/color} can make up for the lack of defense the Way of Poison has and is a pretty good choice.
这…不太合适吧？¤This...isn't right?
你忘记当初是什么要紧的事情耽搁了，只记得后来并未与师父经常联络。¤You forget what important things were delayed, only remember that later did not contact with the master often.
你二人说是论道，但自己却无太多理解。师父指出了你的不足后，简单提点了几句。¤The two of you said they were talking about Tao, but you didn't understand much yourself. After Master pointed out your shortcomings, he briefly mentioned a few words.
我都等你好久了，让我看看你现在究竟有多厉害~¤I've been waiting for you for a long time, let me see how powerful you are now~
徒儿错了，这就去…¤Disciple is wrong, let's go...
有话快说。¤Say something.
当你受伤时，{color=#d0380a}回春诀{/color}可以令你的木系灵气快速恢复你的伤势。¤When you are injured, the {color=#d0380a}Rejuvenation Technique{/color} can make your wood aura quickly restore your injury.
{color=#d0380a}神玄炼体诀{/color}与熔盾诀一样注重防守，可以在你积累起化焰之前抵御敌人的攻击。¤{color=#d0380a}The Divine Xuan Body Refining Technique{/color} focuses on defence like the Molten Shield Technique, which allows you to defend against enemy attacks before you can build up your Living Flame.
若你水道已感悟到小成，{color=#d0380a}强水{/color}可大大加强水道威力。¤If your waterway has realized a small success, {color=#d0380a}strong water{/color} can greatly enhance the power of the waterway.
果然是第三层，没有一丝偏差，不错，不错。¤Sure enough, it is the third floor, there is no deviation, not bad, not bad.
总而言之，冰系重内力，重积累。若想展现冰系的真正威力，至少也要你突破金丹期，领悟{color=#d0380a}裂冰诀{/color}才行。¤All in all, the ice system emphasizes internal force and accumulation. If you want to show the true power of the Ice Element, you must at least break through the Golden Core Stage and comprehend the {color=#d0380a}Cracking Ice Technique{/color}.
不过还是先听听此事的来龙去脉罢。¤But let's hear the ins and outs of the matter first.
只要先用霜冻灵气阻塞住敌人的经脉，敌人的行动就会迟缓下来。¤As long as you block the enemy's meridians with frost aura first, the enemy's actions will slow down.
{FirstName}{shidi}，有事吗？¤{FirstName}{shidi}, is something wrong?
师父蹬了你一眼。¤Master gave you a kick.
你听懂了师尊的意思，略微不情愿地将那妖丹交给了师父。¤You understood what Master meant, and slightly reluctantly handed the demon pill to Master.
呵呵呵呵，就知道徒儿孝顺。¤Ha ha ha, I know the disciple is filial.
化尘之功法神通搭配，以快速积攒“尘”为主。¤The combination of the magical powers of the dust-turning technique is mainly to quickly accumulate dust.
行完礼后，他便同其他长老寒暄去了。很快，又有新的长老过来祝贺你，待到一一寒暄过后，方才离开。¤After the ceremony, he went to greet the other elders. Soon, a new elder came over to congratulate you, and only left after greeting each other.
你若想更加精进，便外出游历，去寻觅机缘……¤If you want to be more diligent, go out and travel to find opportunities...
修炼要沉心静气，循序渐进。¤Cultivation must be calm and gradual.
但九冲图集终究是一本面面俱到的功法，若想在单方面有所建树，还需配合其他功法神通。¤But Jiuchong Atlas is a comprehensive exercise after all. If you want to make achievements unilaterally, you need to cooperate with other exercises and supernatural powers.
感悟的如何？¤How do you feel?
且听我说完此事的来龙去脉罢。¤Let me tell you the ins and outs of this matter.
你才刚突破，便能战胜为师，日后成就定然不可限量。想必，这小小{$zongmen}也定然困不住你的志向。¤You have just made a breakthrough, you will be able to conquer as a teacher, and your future achievements will definitely be limitless. Presumably, this little {$zongmen} will certainly not hold back your ambitions.
若你急于求成，被敌人打断了蓄势，其后果轻则威力大减，重则前功尽弃。¤If you are in a hurry to achieve success, and your momentum is interrupted by the enemy, the consequences will be greatly reduced in power, and in severe cases, all previous efforts will be forfeited.
师父听完了你的感悟后点了点头。¤Master nodded after listening to your insights.
师父摇了摇头。¤The master shook his head.
哈哈哈哈，不愧是我徒儿，果当懂得礼数，也不枉为师将这个好机会给你。¤Hahahaha, worthy of being my apprentice, if you know the etiquette, it's not in vain to give you this good opportunity as a teacher.
再说了，在你筑基的这段时间，我也没能帮上什么大忙，“师父”这名号实在是受之有愧。¤Besides, during the time when you were building your foundation, I couldn't help you much. The title of Master is really well deserved.
只见师父微皱的眉头稍微松开了一些。¤I saw Master's frown slightly loosened.
总的来说，百花流并没有过强或者过弱的方面，一切只是个人的取舍罢了。¤In general, there is no aspect of Baihualiu that is too strong or too weak, everything is just a personal choice.
如此一来，你便可以出师了。¤That way, you can start teaching.
哈哈哈哈，看来你还是稍欠火候啊。¤Hahahaha, it seems that you still owe a little fire.
师父的笑突然僵住了。¤The master's laughter suddenly froze.
若做好自身防御，便可轻易利于不败之地。¤If you do your own defense, you can easily benefit from an invincible position.
缠绕流功法神通之搭配，皆以困敌、反哺为主。¤The combination of the magic power of the winding flow technique is mainly based on trapping the enemy and feeding back.
化尘诀、化沙、还尘这些最基本的，想必你在炼气期已经熟练掌握，我就不多赘述了。¤The most basic of dust-removing art, sand-removing, and dust-returning, must have been mastered by you during the Qi refining period, so I won't go into details.
要知道，你要是丹成不超过五品，就算结成了金丹，也几乎与结婴无缘了……¤You must know that if your alchemy is not more than five rank, even if you form a golden alchemy, you will almost miss out on forming a baby...
木道乃是百花齐放，生生不息。¤The wooden road is a hundred flowers blooming, endless.
你莫不是成心戏耍为师？¤Are you deliberately playing as a teacher?
当然，它的副作用也是不小。若是运用不当，则会伤己甚于伤敌，得不偿失。至于如何规避副作用，便是后话了。¤Of course, its side effects are not small. If it is used improperly, it will hurt oneself more than the enemy, and the gains will outweigh the losses. As for how to avoid side effects, that's another story.
好！若你以后还有什么疑问，尽管来问我罢。¤good! If you have any questions in the future, feel free to ask me.
拿去修至第三层，再来找我。¤Take it to the third floor and come back to me.
怎么，你不会是怕了吧？¤What, aren't you afraid?
修真界以实力为尊，实力到了自然要以平辈相称。若你念得师徒旧情，多送我一些法宝丹药便可。¤The realm of self-cultivation respects strength, and when strength is reached, it will naturally be commensurate with equals. If you remember the old love between master and apprentice, just send me some more magic pills.
若想结出高品阶的金丹，你还需要寻觅一些突破用的丹药、秘术才行……¤If you want to forge a high-grade Golden Core, you still need to look for some medicinal pills and secret techniques for breakthroughs...
嗯……其实这也不全是任务的报酬，也算是我对你今后结丹的一份支持吧。¤Hmm... In fact, this is not all the reward for the task, it can be regarded as my support for you to form a pill in the future.
{color=#d0380a}少阳诀{/color}能很好的补充自身灵气，若你有好好修习气道，一定要修炼此功法。¤{color=#d0380a}Shaoyang Technique{/color} can replenish your spiritual energy very well. If you practice Qi Dao well, you must practice this method.
看来，你还是稍欠火候啊。¤It seems that you still owe a little fire.
此外，{color=#d0380a}赤炎灵阵{/color}可稳定提供灼烧灵气，若你对阵道有一定感悟，也可以修习此阵法。¤In addition, the {color=#d0380a}Scarlet Flame Spirit Array{/color} can stably provide burning aura. If you have a certain understanding of the opposing path, you can also practice this array.
若你缺少木系灵气，{color=#d0380a}寄杖诀{/color}可助你迅速获得木系灵气。¤If you lack wood-type aura, the {color=#d0380a}send stick method{/color} can help you quickly gain wood-type aura.
若略有小成，则务必感悟{color=#d0380a}寄生{/color}。¤If you have a little success, you must realize the {color=#d0380a}parasitic{/color}.
本门主修土道，乃是最正统的尘沙转换之道。¤This sect specializes in the soil path, which is the most orthodox way of converting dust and sand.
这个不难领悟。¤This is not difficult to understand.
{shidi}谬赞了，如今你已经到了金丹期，哪还有师父这一说，今后你我平辈相称即可。¤{shidi} is wrong. Now that you have reached the Golden Core stage, there is no need for Master to say that from now on, you and I are equal to each other.
其次便是要理解不破不立的道理。流光真诀便是先破后立，要伤人，先伤己，所以其威力才能如此之强，以至于在众多功法中脱颖而出，流传至今。¤The second is to understand the principle of indestructibility. The true technique of flowing light is to break first and then stand up. If you want to hurt others, you first hurt yourself, so its power can be so strong that it stands out from many exercises and has been passed down to this day.
师父…¤Master...
感悟的怎么样？¤How do you feel?
进展如何？¤how is the progress?
{color=#d0380a}乱藤术{/color}则能在困敌后反哺自身。¤{color=#d0380a}Rapid Vine Technique{/color} can feed itself back when trapped behind an enemy.
既然如此，徒儿自可一试，只是…师尊为何不自行出手，还可省去一颗珍贵的丹药…¤That being the case, the disciple can give it a try, but...why didn't the master do it by himself, and he could save a precious medicinal pill...
我再说一遍吧，你且听好…¤I'll say it again, listen up...
若你对五行相生之道理解深刻，就可以进修{color=#d0380a}青鸾转生诀{/color}。此功法进可攻退可守，可谓妙用无穷。¤If you have a deep understanding of the way of mutual generation of the five elements, you can learn {color=#d0380a}Qingluan Reincarnation Technique{/color}. This method can be used to attack and retreat, and it can be said to be infinitely useful.
听明白了。¤I understand.
用来形成五行相生的火系手印或功法，想必你在练气期已经熟练掌握，我就不多赘述了。¤You must have mastered the fire mudra or exercises used to form the mutual generation of the five elements, so I won't go into details.
那便去吧。¤Then go for it.
旁白其中大半你都鲜有印象，不知见过与否。偶有其他势力、宗门闻讯前来拜贺的长老，你也都是笑脸相迎。¤Most of the narrations you have little impression of, whether you have seen them or not. Occasionally there are elders from other forces and sects who hear the news and come to congratulate you, and you all greet them with a smile.
不敢当，想必师父也没有发挥全力吧？¤Don't dare to be, presumably the master has not exerted his full strength, right?
再就是与流光真诀一同流传至今的神通{color=#d0380a}寸芒{/color}。它比之金芒术威力更大，但副作用也更大。¤Then there is the supernatural power {color=#d0380a}Rapid Pierce{/color} that has been passed down together with the Flowing Light Technique. It is more powerful than the Golden Ray, but it also has greater side effects。
师父怔了一下，就好像没料到你会答应的这么快一样。¤Master was startled, as if he didn't expect you to agree so quickly.
没事就好…¤it's alright...
剑道讲究一往无前，攻敌必救。金道讲究不破不立，出奇制胜。两者相得益彰。¤Kendo is about forging ahead and attacking the enemy will save you. Jin Dao pays attention to not breaking or standing, and winning by surprise. The two complement each other perfectly.
{color=#d0380a}落岩术{/color}的威力能随着引力的提升而提升，乃引力流核心神通。¤The power of {color=#d0380a}Rock Falling Technique{/color} can increase with the increase of Gravity, which is the core magical power of gravitational flow.
掌握这两个核心神通之后，你就可以学习{color=#d0380a}泰然无波{/color}，此招可以说是敌退我进、转守为攻的关键。¤After mastering these two core supernatural powers, you can learn {color=#d0380a}calm-free{/color}, which can be said to be the key for the enemy to retreat and me to advance, and to switch from defense to attack.
奔雷决乃是蓄势流最为核心的功法。不动则已，动如奔雷，谓之奔雷决。¤Ben Lei Jue is the most core technique of gaining momentum. If it doesn't move, it's already, moving like a thunderbolt, it's called a thunderbolt decision.
原来{$daoyou}刚才也在港口，莫非看到我与那几个海外修士争吵了。¤It turns out that {$daoyou} was also at the port just now, perhaps I was seen arguing with those few overseas cultivators.
是呀，我要炼制的是上品法宝，得全部采用四品材料。虽说用品级更低的材料替代也能成器，但最终成器的灵力就会不足，便只能炼出中品法宝了。¤Yes, what I want to make is a top-grade magic treasure, so I have to use all fourth-grade materials. Although it is possible to use lower grade materials instead, the spiritual power of the final weapon will be insufficient, and then only medium grade magic treasures can be made.
水属性材料基本对应着与水有关的效果，比如用上了天阳、水属性材料打造的环会拥有【{color=#d0380a}驭水{/color}】的效果，对于我们使用水系神通的星河剑派弟子正合适。¤Water attribute materials basically correspond to water-related effects, for example, rings built with yang and water attribute materials will have the effect of 【{color=#d0380a}Harnessing Water{/color}】, which is just right for our Celestial River Sword Sect disciples who use water-based divine abilities.
我这些日子就要赶回神兵阁炼制武器去，{$daoyou}赠与我的材料我一定好好使用。¤I am going to rush back to the Divine Armament Pavilion soon to forge weapons, and I will definitely make good use of the materials {$daoyou} gifted to me.
虽然如同{$daoyouPlayer}所说，如此定价也着实有些不合适...¤Although, as {$daoyouPlayer} says, the pricing is a bit inappropriate...
好不容易收集齐其它材料，总不能半途而废吧。¤It was hard to gather all the other materials, so we couldn't just leave it halfway.
虽说我准备炼制的环都用上了四品材料，但要让灵力完全发挥出来，还要平衡五维。¤Although the ring I am going to forge is made with fourth-grade materials, I have to balance the five dimensions to get the full effect of the spiritual power.
啊，抱歉自顾自说了这么多，{daoyou}来找我是为了何事？¤Ah, sorry to ramble on, but what did {daoyou} come to see me about?
{$daoyou}可是弄到了材料？¤{$daoyou} Have you got the materials?
{$daoyouPlayer}与我有缘，今日这蓬莎巨蟹螯我就按平价的一半卖给你吧。¤{$daoyouPlayer} I'll sell you these Pongsha Crab Claws at half the regular price today.
啊...好的。今日多谢{$daoyou}相助，这些灵石{$daoyou}且收好。¤Ah... Okay. Thank you {$daoyou} for your help today, and keep these spirit stones {$daoyou}.
听{$daoyouPlayer}解释这些我也收获颇多。¤I also gained a lot from listening to {$daoyouPlayer} explain this.
没错，材料我已经弄来了，{$daoyouPlayer}看看是否为你所要的。¤Yes, I've got the material, {$daoyouPlayer} see if it's what you're looking for.
她开始滔滔不绝地讲着自己对宁州商品定价、灵石流通等的见解，时不时冒出些没听说过的名词，让你听的脑袋嗡嗡的。¤She began to ramble on and on about her insights into the pricing of goods and the circulation of spirit stones in Ning Province, occasionally coming up with terms you haven't heard before, making your head numb.
方才{$daoyouPlayer}在港口似乎是为了购买某种材料？¤ {$daoyouPlayer} seems to be in the port to buy some kind of material?
我就把这蓬莎巨蟹螯平价卖给你吧。¤I'll sell you this Pongsha Crab Claws at a regular rate.
好好好，那我就在客栈等候{$daoyou}的好消息了。¤Well, well, well, then I'll be waiting at the inn for good news from {$daoyou}.
我有个不情之请...请问{$daoyou}是否愿意替我去找那几位蓬莎岛修士问问，能不能换到蓬莎巨蟹螯？{$daoyou}要是能把材料弄来，我便花灵石向你购买！¤I have a favour to ask... Would {$daoyou} be willing to ask those Pongsha Island cultivators for me if you can get Pongsha crab claws? {$daoyou} If you can get the material, I will buy it from you at a cost of spirit stones!
既然{daoyou}这么问了，我也实话实说吧，我...我其实...有点怕水。¤Since {$daoyou} asked me that, I'll be honest, I... I'm actually... I'm a bit afraid of water.
我们金虹与星河向来交好，{$daoyouPlayer}就不必客气了。¤We at the Radiant have always been good friends with the Celestial River, so {$daoyouPlayer} there is no need to be so reserved.
这怎么好意思，{$daoyou}这样岂不是亏本了，我还是付正常价格的灵石吧¤How can I do that, {$daoyou} would lose money this way, I'll pay the regular price of spirit stones.
原来是{FirstName}{$daoyou}，真巧啊，在这广陵城碰上。¤So it's {FirstName}{$daoyou}, what a coincidence to run into each other here in Guangling City.
{$daoyou}好不容易帮我取得这材料，我必定不能白白拿了去，不如我也以物换物吧。这是我先前打造的法器，道友不嫌弃的话就拿着这个吧。¤{$daoyou}It was so hard to help me obtain this material, I must not take it for nothing, why don't I also exchange for it? This is the magic weapon I built earlier, so if you don't mind, take this.
{$daoyouPlayer}好，刚才见到你从港口匆匆离开，不知是去哪儿了，原来是往客栈去了。¤Greetings {$daoyouPlayer}, I saw you leaving the port in a hurry just now, I didn't know where you were going, seems you were heading for the inn.
其实刚才{$daoyouPlayer}离开港口后，我和那几个蓬莎岛修士也交谈了一番。¤In fact, after {$daoyouPlayer} left the port just now, I had a conversation with those Pongsha Island cultivators as well.
哼！这里买不到材料，大不了我再花些时日自己去找，可不会让你们赚到我的灵石！¤Hmph! If I can't buy the materials here, I'll just spend more time looking for them myself, but I won't let you earn my spirit stones!
通常来说，用妖兽身上的牙和骨炼器能提升其操控性，而皮和鳞则提升亲和度，脏器这些灵物类，顾名思义则能提升灵性。¤Generally speaking, using the teeth and bones from a Spirit Beast to refine a weapon enhances its manipulation, while skin and scales enhance affinity, and the spirit class of organs, as the name suggests, enhances spirituality.
这位{$daoyou}何事？¤What can I do for you, {$daoyou} ?
蟹螯属于牙、骨类材料，我就指着它来提升武器的操控性了。¤The crab claws are a tooth and bone material, and I'm counting on them to improve the handling of the weapon.
确实是蓬莎巨蟹螯！那{$daoyou}...我要付多少灵石呢？¤Pongsha Crab claws indeed! So {$daoyou}... How many spirit stones do I have to pay?
这个螯，有何特殊之处，{$daoyouPlayer}非要不可呢？¤What is so special about these claws that {$daoyouPlayer} must have them?
好呀好呀！这次真是多亏了{$daoyou}帮忙，这些灵石你且收好。¤Good, good, good! Thanks for {$daoyou}'s help, please take these spirit stones.
怕水...可你却还是星河剑派的，星河剑派不是以水系功法见长吗。¤Afraid of water... But you are still from the Celestial River Sword School. Isn't the Celestial River Sword School famous for its water-based techniques?
确实如此，{$daoyouPlayer}可是因为材料价格争吵？¤It's true, {$daoyouPlayer}, are you arguing over the price of materials?
她顿了一下，将头一侧，双眼看向了地面，你感到气氛凝重决定不再追问。¤She pauses for a moment, turning her head to the side and her eyes to the ground, and you feel the atmosphere gloomy deciding not to pursue the matter.
{$daoyouPlayer}莫要着急，我还需要些时日。¤{$daoyouPlayer}Don't worry, I need some more time.
想不到{$daoyou}对炼器十分有研究，今日收益良多。¤I didn't expect {$daoyou} to be so knowledgeable about forging, and I have learned a lot today.
这类材料在宁州都很稀有，听说无尽之海上的蓬莎巨蟹，其蟹螯正是我所需的材料，而且还算好获得些。¤Such materials are rare in Ning Province, and I heard that the Pongsha Crab on the Endless Sea has the exact material I need for its claws, and it's a bit easier to obtain.
{$daoyou}如此坚持，我也不好再推脱。今日十分感谢{$daoyou}相助，{$daoyou}收好这些灵石。¤If {$daoyou} is so insistent, I shouldn't refuse further. I am very grateful to {$daoyou} for helping me today, {$daoyou} please take these spirit stones.
谁叫你如此贪心。¤Who asked you to be so greedy.
唉，收集四品材料本就不易，况且只收集一两种还不行，得凑齐多种类型的材料，{$daoyou}也要提前规划才行。¤Alas, it's not easy to collect fourth-grade materials, and it's not enough to collect just one or two, you have to get together multiple types of materials, {$daoyou} and you have to plan ahead to do so.
这怎么担受得起！我还是按照平价付灵石吧。¤How can I afford to do that? I'd rather pay the flat rate for the spirit stones.
不好！被发现了！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Not good! I was found! {vpunch=10,0.5}
哼，看来你在宁王府过这几日竟是把脑子也懒散净了，居然带着尾巴来见我。¤Hmph, it seems that you spent the past few days in Prince Ning's Mansion, and you have completely slackened your mind, and came to see me with your tail.
逸风城外¤Outside Yifeng City
什么？！望长老宽恕！¤What?! Hope the elders forgive me!
已经这么晚了，怎么还不见长老...难道出了什么意外？¤It's so late, why haven't I seen the elders... Is there something unexpected?
御剑门？{$TmpTalkString}说的若是九嶷山上那座被阵法封印的遗迹，我倒是知晓一二。¤The Royal Sword Sect? {$TmpTalkString} said if it was the relic on Jiuyi Mountain that was sealed by a formation, I would know a thing or two about it.
没错，那御剑门掌门私通魔门，也不知做了什么，竟能散布如此之多的魔气。¤That's right, that Royal Sword Sect's headmaster had fornicated with the Devil's Sect and had done who knows what to spread so much Devil's Qi.
御剑门...你说的是那个擅使游身剑法的门派吧？¤The Royal Sword School... You're talking about the school that specializes in the Sword of Wandering, right?
不过我们竹山宗对于私通魔门之人一向不留情面。既然那御剑门掌门步入魔道，只能说是他自取灭亡，怪不得旁人。¤However, the Bamboo Mountain Sect has always shown no mercy to those who fornicate with the devil. Since that Royal Sword Sect's leader has fallen into the devil's path, we can only say that he has brought about his own destruction, and no one can be blamed.
若是放任不管，待魔气自然消散，对我等修真者自然不会有太大影响，但九嶷山一带的凡人却难免因此遭罪。¤If we leave it alone, when the demonic energy dissipates naturally, it will not affect us cultivators too much, but the mortals in the Jiuyi Mountain area will inevitably suffer as a result.
这御剑门数百年前倒也算有些实力，不过如今已经很少有人提起这段过往了。¤This Royal Sword Sect was somewhat powerful hundreds of years ago, but nowadays few people talk about this past.
私通魔门？¤Secret ties with the Devil's Gate?
可惜，可惜啊...¤Pity, pity...
哼...陈年往事，何必再提，这千年来宁州覆灭的宗门又何止那御剑门一个。¤Hm... There is no need to talk about the old days. The Royal Sword Sect is not the only sect that has been destroyed in Ning Province over the past thousand years.
没错，据说当年是一名{color=#d0380a}离火门弟子{/color}最先发现此事，双方争斗了一场还死伤了不少弟子。¤Yes, it is said that it was a {color=#d0380a}Disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate{/color} who first discovered the matter back then, and there was a fight between the two sides and many disciples were killed and injured.
御剑门...此派已经覆灭数百年了，我也只是听说过一些传闻。¤The Royal Sword Sect... This sect has been extinct for hundreds of years, and I have only heard rumours about it.
如此一来，只需再设一普通封印法阵将仙剑锁住，外围再配合五派一同布下迷踪法阵，便可确保御剑门之危解除。¤In this way, all that is needed is to set up another ordinary sealing spell formation to lock the Immortal Sword in place, and then to work together with the five factions to set up the Disorientation Spell Formation on the periphery to ensure that the danger to the Royal Sword Sect is removed.
这御剑门所处的九嶷山与我派相邻，因此与我派也是偶有交际。因此消息传来后，我派很快就曾派遣长老前往九嶷山调查，果真发现了魔门出没的踪迹。¤This Royal Sword Sect is located in the Jiuyi Mountain, which is adjacent to our sect, and therefore has occasional dealings with our sect. When the news came to us, our sect soon dispatched elders to Jiuyi Mountain to investigate and indeed found traces of the demon clan's presence.
是大长老...还是杨管家...？¤Is it the Grand Elder... Or was it Steward Yang...?
御剑门？哼，此派覆灭数百年了，{$TmpTalkString}怎么想起打听它了？¤The Royal Sword Sect? Hm, this sect has been extinct for hundreds of years, why did {$TmpTalkString} remember to inquire about it?
不过散人我无拘无束惯了，从来不去掺和这些与我无关的事情。你要是想知道些什么，就亲自去问问那些个宗门的长老吧。¤But I'm used to being uninhibited, I never get involved in these things that have nothing to do with me. If you want to know something, just ask the sect elders yourself.
噢？你说的是几百年前被那五大门派围攻的御剑门吧，当年此事确实是轰动一时啊。¤Oh? You're talking about the Imperial Sword Sect that was besieged by those five sects a few hundred years ago, right? The matter was indeed a sensation back then.
此布阵之法即便如今看来也是颇为巧妙，因此被记录在我族古籍之中。不知我说的这些，对{$TmpTalkString}可有帮助？¤This method of laying out a formation is quite ingenious even today, so it was recorded in the ancient books of my people. I don't know if what I've said is helpful to {$TmpTalkString}?
那些御剑门弟子见事迹败露，竟直接对那些前去调查的离火门弟子动了杀心。双方在九嶷山大打出手，我派死伤惨重，连当时的首席弟子也命陨于此。¤When the disciples of the Royal Sword Sect saw that their story was exposed, they directly killed the disciples of the Heavenly Fire Gate who went to investigate. The two sides fought in Jiuyi Mountain, and our school suffered heavy casualties, and even the chief disciple at that time was killed.
谁曾想正好遇上那御剑门掌门魔化以后实力大增，与其它各门长老战作一团。若非我派长老出手相助，恐怕还真拿不下他。¤Who would have thought that the Royal Sword Sect's strength has increased greatly after the demonization, and the elders of other sects are fighting together. If not for the elders of my school to help, I'm afraid it really can not take him.
据说当年御剑门掌门私通魔门，因而被五大派的高手围攻，宗门也付之一炬。¤It is said that the Royal Sword Sect's headmaster fornicated with the devil, and thus was besieged by the experts of the five sects, the sect also went up in flames.
他用剑如神，又与掌门师兄私交匪浅，本是老夫十分敬仰的一位前辈。也不知他是受了什么蛊惑，竟敢私通魔门，最后连累整个宗门与他陪葬。¤He used the sword like a god, and with the master brother personal friendship is very shallow, is a senior I greatly admire. I don't know what compulsion he was under, how dare he fornicate with the devil sect, and finally dragged the whole sect to bury with him.
是时，我派长老便想出了将一柄纯阳仙剑作为阵眼，同时也是容器，布阵于御剑门之中。在阵法的引导下，门内的魔气会不断被引入仙剑之中。¤At that time, the elders of our school came up with the idea of using a pure Yang immortal sword as the eye of the formation, as well as the container, to set up a formation in the Royal Sword Gate. Under the guidance of the formation, the demonic energy inside the door would be continuously introduced into the immortal sword.
这御剑门掌门当年私通魔门，我派也有不少弟子死在他们手上。后来还是我们五派的元婴高手一同出手，才把这魔门给灭了。¤This Royal Sword Sect's leader was in league with the Devil's Sect, and many of our sect's disciples died at their hands. It was only when the YuanYing experts of our five sects came together that we were able to destroy this demon clan.
此派覆灭后，宗门遗迹也被五派共同布阵封印，此后数百年间便再也没有人提起它了。¤After the destruction of this sect, the sect's ruins were also sealed by a joint formation of the five sects, and it has not been spoken of since for centuries.
那御剑门掌门当年可是被称为同阶无敌手的宁州第一人，就连那金虹剑派的掌门也略逊他一筹。¤That Royal Sword Sect's Sect Master was known as the number one man in Ning Province who was unrivalled in his class. Even the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect's Sect Leader was slightly inferior to him.
我派掌门原本与那御剑门掌门交好，一开始也不愿相信此事。可事发之时，那御剑门掌门已魔化，证据确凿也由不得我们不信呐。¤Our sect leader was originally good friends with the Royal Sword Sect leader, and at first we did not want to believe this. But at the time of the incident, the Sword Master was already demonised, and the evidence was so overwhelming that we couldn't believe it.
御剑门？此事我倒是知晓一二。¤The Royal Sword Sect? I know a thing or two about this matter.
你若真想调查些什么，就去问问五大门派的那些个长老们吧，看看他们又会编出些什么理由来为自己辩解。¤If you really want to investigate something, ask the elders of the five sects and see what excuses they will make up to justify themselves.
当年这御剑门掌门也不知受了什么蛊惑，竟敢私通魔门，还惹出了不少事端，这才遭得我们宁州五派合力围攻。¤Back then, this Royal Sword Sect leader was under some kind of compulsion and dared to collaborate with the Devil's Sect, causing a lot of trouble, which led to the siege by the five sects in Ning Province.
{$TmpTalkString}怎么想起打听这个了？¤Why did {$TmpTalkString} remember to enquire about this?
那些御剑门弟子拒不承认也就罢了，竟然还用卑劣的手段暗算我们。若非大师兄舍命相助，恐怕我们是难以逃回离火门的。¤Those disciples of the Royal Sword Sect refused to admit it, but they even used despicable means to assassinate us. If it wasn't for Senior Brother's help, I'm afraid it would have been difficult for us to escape back to the Heavenly Fire Gate.
害，记不太清了，{$TmpTalkString}问这个做什么？¤I can't quite remember what {$TmpTalkString} is asking this for.
当年传言这御剑门掌门私通魔门，咱们宁州五派自然不可坐视不管，便一同出手将此宗门灭了。¤Back then, it was rumoured that the head of the Royal Sword Sect was in league with the Devil's Clan, so naturally the five sects in Ning Province could not sit idly by and do nothing.
御剑门？我记得学《青莲剑诀》的时候好像听谁起过这个门派来着...¤The Royal Sword Sect? I remember hearing someone mention this school when I was learning the Green Lotus Sword Skill...
我派原先在宁州古迹中就与这御剑门有过冲突，怀疑这御剑门掌门在古迹中得了什么魔物，便派遣长老暗中调查。¤Our school had a conflict with the Royal Sword Sect at the Ning Province monument, and we suspected that the Royal Sword Sect leader had obtained some kind of demonic object in the monument, so we sent our elders to investigate secretly.
这御剑门覆灭数百年了，若非{$TmpTalkString}问起，我倒是都快忘了。¤It's been hundreds of years since this Royal Sword Sect was destroyed, and if I hadn't {$TmpTalkString} asked about it, I would have forgotten about it.
不该打听的事少打听，像这等小门小派被灭了也只能怪自己实力不济。¤The only thing you can blame for the destruction of a small sect like this one is your own lack of strength.
按我族记载，这御剑门当年被五大派围攻后，虽然落败，但宗门内外四溢的魔气却仍然相当棘手。¤According to our clan's records, after this Royal Sword Sect was besieged by the five sects back then, although it fell, the demonic aura spilling out from inside and outside the sect was still quite tricky.
此事或许还有什么不为人知的内幕，但像这样没有底蕴的门派，偶然靠一两个成功突破到元婴期的天才崛起一时，但到底是不能长久的。¤There may be some unknown inside story to this matter, but a sect like this with no heritage, which occasionally relies on one or two geniuses who have managed to break through to the Nascent Soul stage to rise for a while, is not sustainable in the end.
此事原本与我派无关，不过受那金虹剑派掌门所邀去为两派化解矛盾。没想到事发之时，那御剑门掌门已魔化，证据确凿也由不得我们不信呐。¤This matter originally had nothing to do with our school, but we were invited by the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect to help resolve the conflict between the two schools. I didn't expect that when the incident happened, the Royal Sword Sect leader was already demonized, and we couldn't believe the evidence.
哎，当年御剑门被灭门之时，老夫才刚刚突破元婴，而那御剑门掌门早已是宁州赫赫有名的剑修。¤When the Royal Sword Sect was destroyed, I had only just broken through to the first generation, while the Royal Sword Sect leader had long been a famous sword practitioner in Ning Province.
御剑门？此派虽已覆灭数百年了，但当年确实与我派有些瓜葛。¤The Royal Sword Sect? This sect has been extinct for hundreds of years, but it did have some involvement with my sect back then.
不错，当年这御剑门私通魔门之事被我派弟子发现，正是由大师兄和我一起带着几名内门弟子一起去调查的。¤That's right, back then, when this Royal Sword Sect's fornication with the Demon Sect was discovered by our sect's disciples, it was the Eldest Brother and I who went to investigate together with a few inner disciples.
不错，当年这御剑门私通魔门之事被我派弟子发现，而后便是由火云长老与当时的首席内门弟子一同前去调查的。¤It is true that the disciples of our school discovered that the Royal Sword Sect was collaborating with the Demon Sect, and it was Elder Fire Cloud who went to investigate the matter together with the chief inner disciple at that time.
若是某一日元婴陨落，又无后继之人掌舵，这宗门从没落到覆灭往往也不过百年罢了，与如今的结局也不会有什么不同。¤If one of the yen babies had fallen and there was no successor at the helm, the sect would have been no more than a hundred years old, and would have ended no differently than it does today.
魔气？¤Demonic Qi?
最近附近有不少散修失踪，我得小心行事啊。¤There have been a lot of independent cultivators missing recently, I have to be careful.
千年前我师尊也不过是离火门中一个普通的弟子，据说各大门派掌门齐聚一堂商讨要事，那之后便举派攻上九嶷山，我听得他转述只觉其中有不少谜团。¤Thousands of years ago, my master was just an ordinary disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate. It is said that the heads of the big sects gathered together to discuss important matters. After that, they attacked Jiuyi Mountain. There are many mysteries.
千年前围剿御剑门之事我也只是从过往的记事玉简中得知一二。其掌门勾结魔修，作恶多端，好在当时各大门派将其围剿，免我宁州百姓苦难。修仙之人当正道心，莫再打听魔门妖道。¤I only learned about the encirclement and suppression of the Imperial Sword Gate thousands of years ago from the jade slips of the past. Its head colluded with evil cultivators and did a lot of evil. Fortunately, various sects encircled it at that time to save the people of Ning Province from suffering. Cultivator should have a righteous mind, and don't ask about the evil again.
当年我派掌门受其唆使，险些酿成大祸！若不是掌门心生疑窦，恐怕我金虹剑派也落得同御剑门一样的下场！¤Back then, my head was instigated and almost caused a catastrophe! If it weren't for the head to be suspicious, I'm afraid my Golden Rainbow Sword faction would end up just like Imperial Sword Sect!
当年御剑门是被五大门派联手剿灭的，说不定{$zhangmen}知道一些内幕...{w}{w=0.5}¤Imperial Sword Sect was annihilated by the five sects. Maybe {$zhangmen} knew some inside information...{w}{w=0.5}
当时只道御剑门私通魔门，却也不知通的哪门，又是何人私通......¤At that time, only the imperial sword gate was connected to the magic gate, but I didn't know which gate was connected, and who was fornicating...
此事你从何听来？御剑门乃千古罪人，其掌门手持魔剑，更是其心可诛！¤Where did you hear this? Imperial Sword Sect is a sinner from the ages, and its head holds a magic sword, which is even more condemning!
传闻二人最初是因一把灵剑发生争执，尔后不欢而散，甚少往来。¤It is rumored that the two had a dispute over a spirit sword at first, and then they separated unhappy and seldom interacted with each other.
御剑门......你打听此事作何？莫非千年前余孽未清，今日再次祸乱宁州？¤Imperial Sword Sect...what are you asking about this? Could it be that the remnants of the sins that have not been cleared thousands of years ago have brought trouble to Ning Province again today?
我派消息闭塞，当年之事哪怕记事玉简也未曾留下多少有用讯息。¤Our Sect a message to shut down, even if I remember the jade slip, there was not much useful information left.
只依稀说了个金虹剑派掌门率各大门派攻上御剑门，讨伐魔门党羽。至于当年具体发生了什么，倒是没人清楚......¤I only vaguely said that the head of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect led the various main sects to attack the Imperial Sword Sect and defeat the Demon Sect's gangsters. As for what happened that year, no one knows...
千年前之事我也不太清楚，但据师祖说当时金虹剑派掌门似与御剑门掌门私交甚密，不知为何最后竟势同水火，以至后来竟率各大派围攻御剑门。¤I don’t know what happened thousands of years ago, but according to the master, the head of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect seemed to have a close relationship with the head of the Imperial Sword Sect. I don’t know why it was in the end, and even later led all the major factions to besiege. Jianmen.
道友果真是人中翘楚，令我等钦佩折服。¤Fellow Daoist is really the best among people, so we admire and convince.
擂台上的两位修士修为差距过大，很快便结束了比赛。¤The strength gap between the two cultivators in the ring is too big, and the competition soon ended.
擂台上体魄强劲的体修修士凭借霸道的体魄连连退敌，通过他的比赛你掌握了些许体道技巧。¤The strong physique cultivator on the ring retreats back and forth with his domineering physique. Through his competition, you have mastered some physical skills.
看来道友志不在此，我等也自不强留，凭借道友的修为想必能在无尽之海打出自己的名头来。¤It seems that Daoist ambition is not here, and I am not forced to stay. With the cultivation of Daoist, I must be able to make my name in the endless sea.
身上的灵石好像不太够，还是改日再来吧...¤The spirit stones on my body don't seem to be enough, so let's come back another day...
擂台上擅用暗劲的修士招招毒辣，令对方接应不暇，在这场比试中你隐约触摸到一丝气之道的法门。¤On the ring, the cultivators who are skilled in the dark force recruit viciously, making the other party overwhelmed. In this competition, you vaguely touched the way of the air.
不知道友可有意入我连家麾下，成为千流岛供奉？¤I don't know if your friend will enter my Lian's family and become a guest elder of Qianliu Island?
那连家修士收下灵石后递给你一块玉简，上面刻有观众席的座位号。¤The Lianjia cultivator accepted the spirit stone and handed you a piece of jade slip with the seat number of the auditorium engraved on it.
哈哈，道友定不会为今日所做的决定后悔，放眼无尽之海，只有我连家的功法最为强劲。¤Haha, fellow Taoists will definitely not regret the decision made today. Looking at the endless sea, only my Lianjia has the strongest practice.
成为千流岛供奉，便可修炼圣坛内的秘法，令道友实力更上一层。¤Becoming guest elder of Qianliu Island, you can practice the secret method in the altar and become much stronger.
擂台上修习金系功法的修士以锐不可当的攻势迅猛出击，你在这其中体悟到了金的锋锐。¤The cultivators practising the gold-based exercises on the arena attacked swiftly with an unstoppable offensive, and you realized the sharpness of gold in this.
擂台上修习木系功法的修士一手毒功出神入化，你通过他的比试领悟到一丝道法。¤The cultivators who practiced the wood system exercises on the arena are very good at poisoning skills. You can comprehend a trace of Taoism through his test.
台上修士一人擅用神识功法，另一人则为用毒高手。灵力碰撞间保护擂台的屏障受击荡出阵阵涟漪，妙法纷纭的战斗令你获益匪浅。¤One of the cultivators on the stage is a master of divine consciousness, and the other is a master of poison. The barrier that protects the arena in the collision of spiritual powers is hit and ripples, and you benefit from the diversified battles.
你在台下打了个盹儿，再睁眼时擂台已经结束了。¤You took a nap in the audience, and when you opened your eyes, the ring was over.
擂台上的两位修士修为平平，也没什么独门功法，你看得甚是无趣。¤The two cultivators on the ring are average, and they don't have any unique techniques. You look very boring.
擂台上的剑修招式凌厉，一柄灵剑杀气四溢，你体悟到些许剑的真意。¤The sword repair moves on the ring are sharp, and a spirit sword is full of murderous intent. You can realize a little bit of the true meaning of the sword.
此处为千流岛连家开设的盘口，为防止修士在擂台上投机取巧，比赛前须得为自己押注。若是道法高深赢得擂台，这里自然按赌注做赔。¤This is the handicap opened by the Qianliu Island Lianjia. To prevent cultivators from speculating in the ring, they must bet for themselves before the game. If the Taoist method wins the ring with a high level of skill, it is natural to pay according to the bet.
你远远地看到擂台上似乎有修士正在斗法。¤You see from a distance there seems to be a cultivator fighting on the ring.
你整理衣冠，飞身上台，开始了这一轮的比试。¤You tidy up your clothes, fly onto the stage, and start this round of competition.
擂台上修习土系功法的修士防御神通精彩绝伦，通过他的比试你领悟到一丝道法。¤The cultivators who practiced the earth system exercises on the ring have wonderful defensive supernatural powers. Through his test, you can comprehend a trace of Taoism.
你循着编号很快找到了自己的座位并落座，准备观看接下来的比试。¤You followed the number and quickly found your seat and took a seat, ready to watch the next competition.
要押注多少灵石？¤How many spirit stones do you want to bet on?
过了一段时间后，你注意到搭设盘口的连家修士们收起了摊位，想来擂台即将开赛了。¤After a while, you noticed that the Lianjia cultivators who set up the handicap had put away their stalls, thinking that the ring is about to start.
擂台上擅用神识功法的修士招式诡秘莫测，你沉浸在他精妙的神通中不可自拔。¤The tricks of the cultivators in the arena who are good at using divine consciousness techniques are unpredictable. You can't extricate yourself from being immersed in his exquisite magical powers.
这是你的参赛玉简，请千万拿好切勿丢失。¤This is your jade slip, please take it and don't lose it.
擂台上的两位修士修为高深，一时胜负难分，令观看这场比赛的你获益匪浅。¤The two cultivators on the ring have a high level of cultivation, and it is difficult to distinguish the victory or defeat at the moment. It will benefit you a lot from watching this game.
道友请先随总管事面见岛主，其后再商议具体事宜。¤Friends of Taoism, please meet the island owner with the general manager first, and then discuss specific matters.
道友请缴纳500灵石的观赛费。¤Friends of Taoism, please pay the 500 Lingshi watching fee.
擂台上修习水系功法的修士一手惊涛止水令人拍案叫绝，你在她精妙的操控中隐隐得到了一些启发。¤The cultivator practicing the water system technique on the ring is amazing, and you are faintly inspired by her subtle manipulation.
擂台上修习火系功法的修士一出手烈焰灼灼，场内的温度都高了几分，不愧是玄火神通！¤When the cultivator practicing the fire system on the arena fired with blazing flames, the temperature in the arena was a little bit higher, it deserves to be the mysterious fire magic power!
你来到千流岛势力搭建的擂台附近，台下已经聚集了许多准备参赛的修士。擂台四周人声鼎沸，许多散修支起了摊贩，甚至还有修士搭设起盘口。¤You arrive near the ring erected by the forces of Thousand Stream Island, and many cultivators ready to compete have already gathered under the stage. The ring is surrounded by a lot of people, many independent cultivators have set up stalls, and there are even cultivators who have set up handicaps.
有请{FirstName}{LastName}上台！¤Please {FirstName}{LastName} come on stage!
你有些好奇地凑上前去，发现掌管盘口的修士们清一色地穿着连家道袍。¤You leaned forward with some curiosity and found that the cultivators in charge of the handicap were all wearing robes.
道友是参加擂台还是台下观赛？{w}{w=0.5}¤Do fellow Daoists participate in the ring or watch the game offstage? {w}{w=0.5}
{w}{w=0.5}不须多时第一组修士飞身上台，擂台上顿时术法纷呈。¤{w}{w=0.5} There is no need for a long time for the first group of cultivators to fly onto the stage, and the arena suddenly shows a variety of spells.
擂台上的修士布下奇阵，你定睛观察，似乎是效果奇特的太阴奇门阵。通过揣摩他的阵法，你也获得了一些领悟。¤The cultivator on the ring set up a strange formation. You look intently, and it seems that it is a peculiar Taiyin strange formation. By trying to figure out his formation, you have also gained some insights.
不过若是逊人一筹输了擂台，这赌注嘛...{w}{w=0.5}¤However, if the inferior loses the ring, this bet...{w}{w=0.5}
你丝毫不在意嘈杂的打斗声，只是静静地闭上眼睛调养生息，为自己的比赛养精蓄锐。¤You don't care about the noisy fighting, just quietly close your eyes to rejuvenate and recharge your energy for the game.
反了！反了！你怎么敢...¤Reverse! Reverse! How dare you...
好你个无耻老儿，谁和你这不要脸的忘八端是一家人！¤Well, you shameless old man, who is a family with you shameless Wangba Duan!
见到你来，林沐心连忙起身，拉着你一起坐到一旁。苗矮长老皱着眉头看了你们一眼，却没有说话。¤Seeing you here, Lin Muxin quickly got up and pulled you to sit aside. Elder Miao Ai frowned and looked at you, but didn't speak.
冲虚长老，之前的事情是我们林家教导无方，才闹出了这样的丑事，老夫也是难辞其咎，先自罚一杯。¤Elder Chongxu, the previous incident was that our Lin family had no way of teaching, and that caused such a scandal. The old man is also to blame, so he punished himself for a cup first.
放肆！家族账本岂由得你这小辈擅自翻阅！¤Presumptuous! How can the family account book be read by you juniors without authorization!
冲虚长老说的是，反正大家马上就是一家人了，再说这些未免伤了和气。¤What Elder Chongxu said is that everyone will be a family anyway. Anyway, it will hurt your harmony.
大堂之上，酒宴已经开始，林府的诸位你见过或是没有见过的大小长老都已悉数入席。¤Above the lobby, the banquet has already begun, and all the elders and elders of the Lin Mansion that you have or haven't seen have all attended.
哈哈哈哈，既然都快是一家人了，怎么还不见沐雪？我今日来可就是为了见她啊。¤Hahahaha, since they are almost a family, why haven't you seen Mu Xue? I came today to see her.
林沐心一边说着，一边举起手中的玉简，栖云长老见此面色大变，纵身一跃便要出手来夺！¤As Lin Muxin said, she raised the jade slip in her hand. Seeing this, Elder Qiyun's expression changed drastically, and he jumped to grab it!
（低声）看到主席位上坐着的那个满脸大胡子的人了么，他就是星宫的冲虚长老。¤(Whispering) Did you see the bearded man sitting in the chair? He is the elder Chongxu of the Star Palace.
你身旁的林沐心听到这里气得浑身发抖，怒气冲冲地便站了起来。¤Lin Muxin beside you trembles with anger when she hears this, and stands up angrily.
不过是小孩子闹脾气而已，既然现在事情已经过去了，我也不会再来计较这些的。¤It's just a child making a temper. Now that the matter is over, I won't care about it anymore.
你吓了一跳，赶紧向一旁躲开。¤You were taken aback, and quickly avoided.
沐心，还不快过来给冲虚长老赔不是！¤Mu Xin, don't hesitate to come over and pay elder Chongxu!
大长老，我已经掌握了栖云长老私自挪用家族资产，做假账，勾结外人的证据。¤Elder, I already have evidence that Elder Qiyun misappropriated family assets privately, made false accounts, and colluded with outsiders.
不光是你，几位长老也呆若木鸡，看来谁也没见过林沐心如此泼辣的一面。¤Not only you, but the elders are also dumbfounded. It seems that no one has seen Lin Muxin's pungent side.
这位道友可听说过武陵城五年举办一次的盛会？¤Has this fellow Taoist heard of a grand event held in Wuling City every five years?
道友请便，我忙着修练要先回客房了。¤Friends, please, I'm busy practicing and going back to the guest room first.
每次见到倪家大张旗鼓地四处寻人，就知道一定是这位倪少爷又偷偷溜出家门了。世家大把大把的资源放着不用偏要自己出门修练，真是怪人一个。¤Every time I see the Ni family looking for people with great fanfare, I know that the young master Ni must have sneaked out of the house again. The family has a lot of resources to go out and practice on their own, which is really weird.
唉，要是能在英杰会上夺魁的话就可以把筑基丹送给小师妹了。如此这般，这般如此，嘿嘿......¤Hey, if I can get first place at the Young Hero Tournament, then I can give the Foundation Pill to Junior Sister. Then... we can so and so, hehe...
说起这英杰会，主办方倪家在武陵城真可谓家喻户晓。但提起倪家，最盛的传闻却是那神龙见首不见尾的小少爷。¤Speaking of this hero meeting, the organizer, Ni family, is a household name in Wuling City. But when it comes to the Ni family, the most prevalent rumors are the little young master who sees the dragon without seeing the end.
那小少爷也不知怎的偏生和安逸日子过不去，非要离家出走。这不，已经是第五次了。¤The little young master also somehow had a lopsided and easy life, so he had to run away from home. No, it's the fifth time.
看来这里便是那头传闻中伤人妖兽的出没之地了...¤It seems that this is the place where the rumors of human and monster beasts haunt...
{xiongdi}请说，倪某必当知无不言。¤{xiongdi} ask away, and I will be sure to tell you everything I know.
听说这几日集会结束以后，有许多单独行动的散修，都莫名其妙地失踪了。依我看，这一定是那些沂山的小鬼干的，{xiongdi}你也需多加小心啊¤I heard that after the auction in the past few days, there were many independent cultivators who disappeared inexplicably. In my opinion, this must be the work of those little bastards in Mt.Yi. {xiongdi} You need to be more careful.
离火门主修火系功法，是宁州五大门派之一。虽然他们从不拒绝散修拜入宗门，但因为环境太恶劣，也很少有人能够在那里坚持下来。¤Heavenly Fire Gate experts of the fire element is one of the five major sects in Ning Province. Although they welcome independent cultivators to enter the sect, because of the harsh environment, few people can persist and stay there.
英杰会可是我们武陵城的一大盛事，每五年才举办一次。主要目的是为宁州的各大势力物色资质出众的青年才俊，我们倪家也算是主办方之一。¤The Young Heroes' Tournament is a major event in Wuling City. It is only held every five years. It's main purpose is to find young talents with outstanding qualifications for the major forces in Ning Province. Our Ni family are also one of the organizers.
化尘教主修土系功法，是宁州五大门派之一，相传是万余年前从衡州来到宁州开宗立派的，行事神秘，最近似乎并不公开对外招收弟子。¤Aeonic Sands Temple is one of the five major schools in Ning Province. It is said that he came to Ning Province from Hengzhou more than 10,000 years ago to establish a school. He acts mysteriously. It seems that he has not recruited disciples publicly recently.
竹山宗主修木系功法，是宁州五大门派之一，传承悠久，据说已有数十万年的历史了，他们目前似乎正在招收外门弟子。怎么，{xiongdi}你也想去试试？¤Bamboo Mountain Sect is one of the five sects of Ning Province, which specializes in the wood system. It has a long heritage and is said to have a history of hundreds of thousands of years. They seem to be recruiting outer disciples. Why, {xiongdi} you also want to go. Try?
星河剑派主修水系功法，是宁州五大门派之一，不过她们门内似乎只招女修，又行事低调，所以我对她们也所知甚少。¤The Galaxy Sword Sect is one of the five major sects in Ning Province who specialize in the water system. However, they seem to only recruit female cultivators and act low-key, so I don't know much about them either.
哈哈，指教不敢当，听说竹山宗招收外门弟子时会设一擂台，只有打赢守擂之人，才能加入。这擂台挑战对于普通散修来说颇有难度，你最好还是做足准备了再去挑战。¤Haha, I don't dare to be a teacher. I heard that when the Bamboo Mountain Sect recruits outer disciples, there will be a ring. Only those who win the ring can join. This ring challenge is quite difficult for ordinary independent cultivators. You'd better do it. I'm ready to challenge again.
竹山宗主修木系功法，是宁州五大门派之一，传承悠久，据说已有数十万年的历史了...他们目前似乎正在招收外门弟子。¤Bamboo Mountain Sect is one of the five sects of Ning Province who specialize in the wood system. It has a long heritage and is said to have a history of hundreds of thousands of years... They seem to be recruiting outside disciples.
金虹剑派主修金系功法，是宁州五大门派之一，创派之人是二十万年前九州飞升第一人的金虹剑仙。他们似乎对门内弟子的悟性要求极高，因此很少有人能过通过他们的测试。¤The Golden Rainbow Sword Sect, which majors in the Golden Technique, is one of the five major sects in Ning Province, and the man who founded it was the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal, the first person to ascend in Kyushu 200,000 years ago. They seem to require a very high level of enlightenment from their disciples, so very few people can pass their tests.
这沂山派啊，是本地一个颇有势力的门派，也有数百年历史了，实力也不弱，但就喜欢干些杀人夺宝的缺德事儿。¤Tch, Mt. Yi sect is a local sect that has some influence in the region. It was founded a several hundreds years ago, and its strength is not bad, but it likes to do some wicked things like murder and plundering.
英杰会虽然只是擂台赛，但修士间一动手，难免有所伤亡，{xiongdi}你如今才炼气初期修为，若是赶在今年便去参赛，实在是太危险了。¤Although the Tournament is single-elimination, but when the cultivators throw down it's inevitable that there will be casualties. {xiongdi}You are only in the early stage of Qi refining. If you go to the competition this year, it could be too dangerous.
来向倪兄请教几个问题。¤Can I ask Brother Ni a few questions.
环境...恶劣？¤The environment...bad?
哈哈哈，{xiongdi}你要是有机会，去看一看便知道了。¤Hahaha, {xiongdi} if you have a chance, just go and take a look.
还请倪兄指教¤Please offer advice as well, Brother Ni
怎么样？准备好我们就出发吧！¤How about it? We'll head out as soon as you're ready!
道友若想去那擂台上比试一番的话，不如先来我们宝光阁买上些许丹药啊。¤If you want to go to the arena for a trial, you might as well come to our Baoguang Pavilion to buy some medicine pills.
听那恒如...古神教卧底所言，似乎魔门正密谋着什么惊天大计......¤Listening to what Hengru...Ancient God Cult undercover said, it seems that the Demon Sect is plotting some terrifying plan...
这是...星河仙剑！如此一来我派的剑阵便可再放光芒，甚好，甚好！¤This is... the Star River Fairy Sword! Then the sword array Our Sect can shine again, very good, very good!
多谢道友助我派找到此物，这是你应得的报酬！¤Thank you fellow daoists for helping me find this thing, this is the reward you deserve!
宁州古迹凶险异常，我实在担忧往日那些师弟师妹...希望此行宗门人才莫要折损。¤The historic sites in Ning Province are extremely dangerous and dangerous. I am really worried about those juniors and sisters in the past... I hope that the sect talents of this trip will not be damaged.
我派传承已有万余年，其中不少功法都遗失在了这漫长年月中，若在宁州古迹中能够找回一些自然是宗门大幸。¤I have passed on the inheritance for more than 10,000 years, and many of the exercises have been lost in these long years. If you can find some of the ancient relics in Ning Province, it will be a great blessing for the sect.
你神识远超同水平修士，一眼便看出这只是一个预警阵法，在你敛息之下，倒也能瞒天过海。¤Your soul sense is far superior to that of cultivators of the same level, and you can see at a glance that this is only an early warning formation, and with your breath restrained, it can be concealed from the world.
你对阵道颇有研究，轻易便将入口的阵法破除了。¤You're quite knowledgeable about formations, and you easily broke the entrance formation.
方壶山本是郁郁葱葱，草木繁茂，可是此处的树木大半都枯萎发黄，地上也布满了干枯的落叶，老死的树皮以及折断的杂草。¤Fang Hu Mountain was originally lush and grassy, but here most of the trees are withered and yellowed, and the ground is covered with dried leaves, old dead bark and broken weeds.
越往深处走，树木的枯萎便越严重。你顺着这个方向，找到了枯木林的中心——“枯木老祖”的洞府。你围着洞府四处搜寻了一番，但一无所获。¤The deeper you go, the more the trees wither. You follow this direction and find the centre of the Deadwood Forest - the cave of the Deadwood Ancestor. You search around the cave, but find nothing.
整体弥漫着一股腐朽、衰败之感。若不说这是方壶山，外人绝不可能想到，此处竟然是竹山宗的辖地。¤An overall sense of decay and decay pervades the area. If it were not for the fact that this is Fang Hu Mountain, it would never occur to an outsider that this is the precinct of the Bamboo Mountain Sect.
这四周什么也没有，看来只有进去才能找到线索了...¤There's nothing around here, so it looks like the only way to find a clue is to go inside...
洞府入口有一个小型阵法，你打算...¤There is a small formation at the entrance to the cave, are you planning to...
好像...这样就可以了？¤It seems like... That's all?
你凭借自己对阵道的理解随意摆弄了一下阵法，似乎没有什么反应...¤You fiddle with the formation at random with your understanding of the dao of the formation and nothing seems to respond...
上次看这里还没有如此不堪，这些年究竟发生了什么？¤Last time I looked this place wasn't so bad, what has happened over the years?
你隐约觉得这只是一个预警阵法，于是你收敛气息，打算瞒天过海。¤You have a vague feeling that this is just an early warning formation, so you collect your breath, intending to hide it from the world.
我派目前还有授业的有三位长老，分别是明河，龙阳\r和镇元三位前辈，你想了解哪一位？¤There are still three elders in my school, namely Raidant River, Dragonlight\r and Zhenyuan. Which one do you want to know about?
龙阳上人主修的是我派功法《流光真决》，对敌时能利用{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}之力大幅度提升金系法门的威能。\r\n¤Venerable Dragonlight's main cultivation technique is the Flowing Radiance Arts. When confronting the enemy, he can use {color=#d0380a}the Elemental Cycle{/color} to greatly enhance the power of Metal techniques.\r \n
还来？？¤Again??
结婴秘术《分神术》，若运用得当可短暂抵御心魔，仅能在结婴时使用。¤The secret technique Distraction Art, if used properly, can temporarily resist the demons. It can only be used when in the nascent soul stage.
分配完毕后，许多修士向你投来羡慕的目光。但你只是淡定的先行离开了。¤After the allocation, many cultivators enviously glance at you, but you just leave calmly.
于剑魄竹成熟时脱落的灵叶，蕴含剑之道韵的叶子，极为稀有。¤The spirit leaves that fall off when Jianpozhu matures, and the leaves that contain the charm of the sword are extremely rare.
看来这就是涵虚仙人的法宝和传承所在了。¤It seems that this is the magic weapon and inheritance of the Hanxu Immortal.
还没等你们前去查看，又有修士在附近发现了几件完好的法宝，若干丹药。¤I haven't waited for you to check it out. Another cultivator found a few intact magic weapons and some pills nearby.
蕴含火之道韵的5阶药材，芒焰果。¤A fifth grade herb that contains the essense of the Dao of Fire, the Flamesoul Mango.
等你和各大势力少主、长老等人离开后，余下的修士才慢慢散去。¤After you, the young masters, elders, and others leave, the remaining cultivators slowly disperse.
感谢{FirstName}道友此次积极助力，可以优先选择一件二等奖励，两件三等奖励。¤Thank you {FirstName} for your active help this time, you can give priority to choosing one second-class award and two third-class awards.
{FirstName}道友此次贡献杰出，可以优先选择一件一等奖励，两件二等奖励，三件三等奖励。¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoists have made outstanding contributions this time, and can give priority to one first-class award, two second-class awards, and three third-class awards.
待你离开后，其他修士才陆续散去。¤After you leave, the other cultivators disperse one after another.
你几乎拿到了全部奖励。周围修士也因此投来嫉妒的目光，若不是各大势力的少主、长老等都在向你祝贺，恐怕已是有人因为嫉妒而向你出手夺宝。¤You almost got all the rewards. The surrounding cultivators also cast jealous eyes on this. If the young masters and elders of the major forces are not congratulating you, I am afraid that someone has already taken the treasure from you because of jealousy.
这次涵虚仙府之行{FirstName}道友几乎解决了所有难题，可以优先选取两件一等奖励，三件二等奖励，四件三等奖励。¤This trip to Hanxu Xianfu {FirstName} Taoist friends has solved almost all the problems, and can give priority to choosing two first-class awards, three second-class awards, and four third-class awards.
由于之前商量过分配方法，大家又出于各种因素并没有想违反这一约定，所以只是选了一个最为公正的修士主持分配，并没有出现哄抢和刀剑相向的局面。¤Since we have discussed the distribution method before, everyone did not want to violate this agreement due to various factors, so we just chose the most fair cultivator to preside over the distribution, and there was no situation of looting and swords.
你循声望去，看到高台上静坐着一具枯骨。它身前放着一把光芒暗淡的灵剑，一个暗淡的玉简，还有一个已然碎裂的玉简。¤You follow the prestige and see a dead bone sitting quietly on the high platform. A dimly glowing spirit sword, a dim jade slip, and a jade slip that is already shattered are in front of it.
你们集中整理了所得秘宝，除了大家看不上的大众货色外，被分为一二三等奖励。¤You have collected the secret treasures in a concentrated manner. Except for the popular goods that everyone looks down on, they are divided into one, two and three rewards.
分配完毕后，众人陆续离去了。¤After the distribution, everyone left one after another.
五品灵舟，旋龟舟。¤Five-Rank Spirit Boat, Rotating Turtle Boat.
{FirstName}道友此次贡献非凡，可以优先选择一件一等奖励，三件二等奖励，四件三等奖励。¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoists have made an extraordinary contribution this time. You can choose one first-class award, three second-class awards, and four third-class awards.
分配完毕后，你感受到了许多羡慕的目光，但你只是淡定的收起奖励，与围上来的倪旭欣，李青麟等人打过招呼后先行离开了。¤After the allocation, you felt a lot of envious eyes, but you just put away the reward calmly, and greeted the surrounding Ni XuXin, Li Qinglin and others before leaving first.
一共五本，分别包含了涵虚仙人对剑，阵，火，气，体五道的领悟。研读后可以获得大量悟道经验。¤There are five books in total, each of which contains Hanxu's understanding of the five ways of sword, formation, fire, qi, and body. After studying, you can get a lot of experience in enlightening.
阵法核心全部被击破后，阵法空间随之消失。你环视一圈后发现阵法内部的修士都被传送到了附近，他们大都伤痕累累，不过倒是出奇的没有修士陨落于此，受伤最重的炎萧在经过简单的治疗后也是看起来没有大碍。¤After all the cores of the formation are destroyed, the formation space disappears. After you look around, you find that the cultivators inside the formation have been teleported nearby. Most of them are scarred, but it is surprising that no cultivators have fallen here. The most injured The severe Yan Xiao did not seem to be in serious trouble even after a simple treatment.
朱珀剑，下品法宝，使用时获得【剑气】*8。¤Juper Sword, a low-grade magic weapon. When used, it gains 【Sword Qi】*8.
完璧吴魁，上品法宝，每次受到伤害时，移除自身【易伤】*1¤End Bi Wu Kui, a top-grade magic weapon, every time you get hurt, remove yourself 【Vulnerable】*1

鬼面炼心丹，服用后心境+7。¤Tempered Heart Pill, Mental State +7 after consumption.
4阶火属性材料火麟玉*4。¤Level 4 fire attribute material fire lin jade*4.
这就点本事，也要帮朋友出头？¤This is a bit of a skill, but also to help a friend come forward?
哈哈哈哈，就知道你厉害。这些灵石你拿着，下次有难还找你忙帮！¤Hahaha, I know you are amazing. You hold these spirit stones, and next time you are in trouble, I will ask you for help!
哈哈哈哈，真当是解气！这些灵石你拿着，莫跟我客气！¤Hahahaha, really relieved! Take these spirit stones, don't be polite to me!
唉…虽然还是输了，但这份心意我是不会忘记的。这两颗培元丹你拿着，快回去养伤吧。¤Alas... Although I still lost, I will never forget this feeling. Take these two Pei Yuan Dan, and go back to recuperate.
他恶狠狠地看了你一眼，带着一群小弟灰头土脸的离开了。¤He gave you a vicious look, and left with a group of younger brothers disgraced.
唉…本来我也打不过，这下你替我把打挨了，还真感觉挺对不起你的…总之先给你两颗培元丹，快回去疗伤吧。¤Alas... I couldn't beat it originally, but now you beat me for me, I really feel sorry for you... In short, I'll give you two Peiyuan Dan, and go back to heal.
随着你最后一击攻去，他应声倒下，身形极为狼狈，嘴角还挂着些许血丝。¤As you attacked with the last attack, he fell down with a sound, his body was extremely embarrassed, and there was a little blood on the corner of his mouth.
之前簇拥在他周围的修士们一个个都瞪大了双眼，鸦雀无声。¤The cultivators who had crowded around him before all widened their eyes and fell silent.
唉…虽然没打过，但你也太够意思了。快服下这两颗培元丹，你要是出了什么差错，我非得挖个坑把自己埋了不可。¤Alas... Although I haven't fought before, but you are too interesting. Quickly take these two Peiyuan Pills, if anything goes wrong, I'll have to dig a hole and bury myself.
{FirstName}道友果然实力不凡，今日多谢了，这么点灵石，不成谢意。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName} is indeed very powerful. I would like to thank you today. Such a little spirit stone is not a thank you.
在一片哄笑声中，你缓缓站起身来，向外走去。¤Amid the roar of laughter, you slowly stood up and walked out.
你并不是他的对手，不一会儿便败下阵来。¤You are not his opponent, and you will be defeated in a short while.
多...多谢前辈手下留情。¤Much...thank you for being merciful, senior.
哈哈哈哈哈哈哈¤Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
小娃娃，回去再修炼个三五年吧。¤Little Wawa, go back and practice for another three to five years.
云雾消散，你闯过了幻雾阵，熟悉的场景又回到了你的眼前...¤The clouds and mist dissipated, it seems you've passed the Mirage Mist Array's tests. A familiar scene returns to your eyes...
这机关傀儡虽然笨重，但威力不俗。若是不能熟练使用新学会的防御神通释放护罩，即便有练气巅峰的修为也难说能胜过它。¤Although this machine puppet is bulky, but it's not very powerful. If you can't skillfully use the newly learned defensive magic to release the shield, even with peak Qi refining cultivation, it is difficult to say that you can beat it.
怎么样，准备再试一次么？¤How about it, are you ready to try again?
等你掌握了我教给你的基础神通后，再来吧。¤Come back when you have mastered the basic magic skills I have taught you.
本门外门弟子的基础神通你已经全部掌握了，若想再学习其它法术，可以自行去宗门藏经阁借阅。¤You have already mastered all the fundamental magic skills for outer disciples of our sect. If you wish to learn other spells, you can borrow them from the sect's scripture collection on your own.
嗯，不错。看来你已经学会了本门的基础神通，让我看看你到底掌握的怎么样吧。¤Well, not bad. It seems that you have learned the basic magic skills of our school, so let me see how well you have mastered them.
这两本秘籍你且收好，待全部领悟后再回来找我，我会考验你的学习情况，然后教你其它的进阶法门。¤These two secret books keep them, comprehended them and then come back to me, I will test your learning progress, and then teach you other advancement methods.
尝试运用{$shentong1}与{$shentong2}，在机关傀儡的攻击下至少支撑{color=#d0380a}六{/color}个回合。¤Try to use {$shentong1} and {$shentong2} to last at least {color=#d0380a} six{/color} rounds under the attack of the machine puppet.
嗯，既是刚入门的弟子，须得先从基础的神通学起。¤Well, since they are new disciples, they must first learn from the basic magic skills.
至于《{$shentong2}》，则是基础的防御性神通。实战时可搭配{$shentong1}使用，运用得当则可抵挡大量伤害。¤As for {$shentong2}, it is a basic defensive magic skill. It can be used in conjunction with {$shentong1} in actual combat, and when used properly, it can resist a large amount of damage.
《{$shentong1}》是我派入门之必修法术。不仅能用来调度体内灵气，还可触发五行连击的效果，提升其它神通的威能，妙用无穷。¤The 《{$shentong1}》 is a required spell for initiation into our school. Not only can it be used to dispatch the spiritual energy in your body, but it can also trigger the effect of the five elemental combinations and enhance the power of other magic skills, which is of infinite use.
失去剑灵操控的飞剑，纷纷跌落在了地上。还没等你缓过口气，只见远方养剑池处，一道黑色的剑气冲天而起，魔气四溢...¤The flying swords that lost the control of the sword spirit fell to the ground one after another. Before you could take a breath, I saw a black sword aura rising into the sky at the sword-raising pond far away, overflowing with devilish energy...
多谢仙师，多谢仙师！¤Thank you Great Celestial, thank you Great Celestial!
趁爷爷我心情好，不想死的话就快滚！¤I'm in a good mood while Grandpa, if you don't want to die, get out!
仙师饶命，仙师饶命啊！是我有眼不识泰山，冒犯了仙师，还请仙师不要与小人计较，放我一条生路啊！¤Venerable Immortal, please spare my life! I had eyes but could not see Mount Tai, and dared to offend the Great Celestial, please I beg you, spare my life!
站住站住，眼睛放大点，这里是你该来的地方么？¤Stop, stop, zoom in, is this where you should be?
你略施了几个小法术就将山贼吓趴在地。¤You cast a few small spells and scared the bandit to the ground.
（这些山贼或许也是因家中贫困不得已落草为寇，倒也不必因此就赶尽杀绝...）¤(These bandits may also have to fall into the grass because of the poverty in the family, but they don’t have to kill them all because of this...)
一伙劫匪占据了这里的山头，你刚一走近，就被一人拦住。¤A group of robbers occupied the top of the hill here. As soon as you approached, you were stopped by one person.
在你的威胁下，这窝山贼一哄而散，想必是不敢再生事端了。¤Under your threat, this nest of bandits broke up in a rush, presumably not dare to have another incident.
你不愿与这些凡人多费口舌，手起刀落，几息之间便将寨子里的数十个山贼尽数解决，没有留下一个活口。¤You don't want to bother with these mortals. You can take the knife and drop it, and you will solve the dozens of bandits in the stockade within a few breaths, leaving no one to survive.
我给你们一天时间，把抢来的粮食财物都归还给附近的村子，然后把这寨子给我烧了。日后若再让我看到你们为非作歹，就别怪我手下不留情了！¤I will give you one day to return all the looted food and property to the nearby village, and then burn the stockade for me. If I see you doing evil in the future, don't blame my subordinates for being merciless!
这些山贼只是普通凡人，不通法术，要解决他们并非难事，你决定...？¤These bandits are just ordinary mortals, they don't know spells. It's not difficult to solve them, you decide...?
正是！既已取得灵草，我便告辞了。¤Exactly! Now that I have obtained the spirit grass, I will leave.
你从玉匣中取出草药，只见其叶片薄如蝉翼，透如琉璃，绿如碧松。¤You take out the herbal medicine from the jade box, and you can see that its leaves are as thin as cicada wings, as transparent as colored glaze, and as green as green pine.
你收拾行装，告别了棠阿三与阮五娘。¤You pack up and bid farewell to Tang Asan and Ruan Wuniang.
你在镇上小住了几日后，阮五娘终于带来了消息。¤After you stayed in the town for a few days, Ruan Wuniang finally brought news.
前辈，我前些阵子托三姐到玉梁边上取来了这灵药，你看可是你所求的？¤Senior, I asked my third sister to fetch this Pill from Yuliang a while ago, do you think it's what you asked for?
不错，此前我在幻境中遭遇的魔修和金虹剑仙，多半也是这古树梦境中的投影。¤Yes, the evil cultivator and the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal I encountered in the illusion earlier were mostly projections from this ancient tree's dream world as well.
你把自己看到的画面向魏无极一一转述。¤You relay the images you see to Wei Wuji.
在你醒来前都没有什么异常...你刚刚看到什么了？¤There was nothing unusual until you woke up... What did you just see?
还有最后我看到的那个背影，又会是什么人呢...¤And the back I saw at the end, who could that be...
古树似乎彻底被唤醒了，海底数百根粗壮的根须将整片图南海搅动的天翻地覆。好在你赶在被这些根须缠住之前，逃回了海面。¤The ancient tree seems to have been completely awakened, and hundreds of thick roots at the bottom of the sea stirred up the entire Tu Nanhai. Luckily you escape back to the surface before you get entangled in these root whiskers.
唉...大千世界，无奇不有。¤Alas... The world is full of wonders.
如果这些动辄划破空间的大战场景真的是古树的梦境，那肯定算不上什么好梦。¤If these scenes of great battles that cut through space at every turn were really the dreams of the ancient trees, they would certainly not be considered good dreams.
怎么回事，这些根须怎么又开始动起来了。¤What's going on? Why are these roots moving again?
此番若不是靠着诛仙剑，还不知能否脱险...若是为了这点好奇心，毁了自己千年修为，可就不值得了。¤If it wasn't for the Immortal Punishing Sword, I don't know if I would have been able to get out of this danger... If I were to ruin my thousand-year cultivation for this curiosity, it would not be worth it.
那正魔之战就已是十万年前的事了，尚有记载的金虹剑仙飞升更是过去二十余万年...再往前的上古辛秘，谁又能弄的清呢。¤The Battle of the Righteous and the Demons was already 100,000 years ago, and the still recorded ascension of the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal was more than 200,000 years ago... Who could have known the secrets of the ancient world further back?
万年前的正魔之战，金虹剑仙一剑开天，还有上古神兽间毁天灭地的战斗...¤The battle between good and evil ten thousand years ago, the Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal's sword that opened up the heavens, and the heaven-destroying battles between ancient gods and beasts...
门口仅有两名守卫与一名金丹修士。两守卫分别负责凡人和低阶修士的入城手续，倒也是井井有条。¤There are only two guards and one Jindan cultivator at the gate. The two guards are responsible for the entry procedures for mortals and low-level cultivators, but also in a well organized manner.
遵城主令！奸诈之辈不得入！残虐之辈不得入！妖邪之辈不得入！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Follow the order of the city lord! The treacherous ones are not allowed! The cruel ones are not allowed! The evil ones are not allowed! {vpunch=10,0.5}
大概是考虑到城中还需要他坐镇，此人并没有追你太久便主动解除锁定离去了。¤Probably considering that the city still needs him to sit in town, this person didn't chase you for too long before he took the initiative to release the lock and leave.
依旧是一众守卫在门口盘查着来往凡人，身后两三修士在闭目养神。¤It is still a group of guards interrogating the mortals at the door, and two or three cultivators behind them are closing their eyes and resting.
修士并未理会你的储物袋，反倒是从储物袋中取出了传音符。你只得运起遁术先行离去。¤The cultivator ignored your storage bag, but took out the sound transmission talisman from the storage bag. You have to transport the escape technique and leave first.
你发现原本喧闹的护城大阵外如今却是安静了不少，在严格的管制下连初入人流都少上了许多，反倒是多了一众守卫，三两修士。¤You find that outside the noisy moat is now a lot quieter. Under strict control, even the flow of newcomers has decreased a lot, but there are more guards, three or two cultivators.
就在你即将进入城中时，一股强大的神识扫过，却径直掠过你向其他位置而去。¤Just as you were about to enter the city, a powerful sacred sense swept across, but it swept past you to another location.
刚从传送阵中迈出，一股神识冲击迎面而来。你闷哼一声，脑中一阵眩晕，接连退后几步才稳住心神。却正好退到了传送阵中。¤Just stepping out of the teleportation formation, a surge of divine consciousness hits oncomingly. You snorted, and there was a dizziness in your mind. You stepped back a few steps to stabilize your mind. But you just retreated into the teleportation formation.
依旧是两个守卫在门口注视着来往凡人，身后一个修士闭目养神。¤It is still the two guards watching the mortals at the door, and a cultivator behind him closed his eyes and rested.
在魏无极出声的同时，你运起遁术迅速远离。¤While Wei Wuji made a sound, you quickly moved away from the escape technique.
还好传送阵仍在运行中。在下一波神识攻击来到前，你强行催动阵法离开了天星城。¤Fortunately, the teleportation formation is still in operation. Before the next wave of consciousness attacks, you force the formation to leave the Star City.
在魏无极出声的同时，你运起遁术迅速远离，却发现并没有人追上来。显然是觉得你既已自行离去，没有赶尽杀绝的必要。¤While Wei Wuji made a sound, you quickly moved away from the escape technique, only to find that no one was catching up. Obviously you feel that you have left on your own and there is no need to kill them all.
当你走上前去，准备像往常一样进入城中时，门口的修士却径直用神识锁定了你，同时催动功法，随时准备动手。¤When you stepped forward and prepared to enter the city as usual, the cultivator at the door directly locked you with his spiritual sense, and at the same time urged the exercises, ready to do it at any time.
念及自己声望较低，你远远地观察着这曾是经常初入的护城大阵出入口。¤Mindful of your low prestige, you observe from a distance that this was the entrance and exit of the moat formation that you often first entered.
当你走近，修士猛地睁开眼，神识也紧紧锁定着你。¤When you approached, the cultivator opened his eyes abruptly, and his soul sense locked you tightly.
是{FirstName}{LastName}！快传音城主府供奉！¤It's {FirstName}{LastName}! Quickly alert guest elders in the City Lord's Mansion!
而那金丹修士却是在闭目养神。只有在筑基期及以上的修士通过时，才会稍稍睁眼。¤The golden core cultivator is closing his eyes and resting his mind. Only when the cultivators of the foundation-building period and above pass, will they slightly open their eyes.
这位小友我还有事，剑你帮我保管好。¤I have business with this young friend, so keep the sword for me.
说罢玄骨携带着一团精血破开空间，转身离开。¤Saying this, Xuan Bone carried a cloud of essence blood to break through space and turned to leave.
这就是炼妖散么？把自己变成这不人不妖的怪物，最后落个形神俱灭。¤Is this the Demon Refining Sanctuary? To turn oneself into this inhuman, inhuman monster and end up with one's soul and body destroyed.
你就是他师傅吧，他本来是托我救你的。¤You are his master, aren't you? He originally asked me to save you.
算了，先出去吧。¤Forget it, get out first.
算了，先去看看轩岚诺吧。¤Never mind, let's go and see Xuan Lanuo first.
我？我不配，倒是道友见到他记得告诉他不要报仇保住宗门传承要紧。我们斗不过古神教的。¤Me? I'm not worthy. Instead, if you see him, remember to tell him that it's important not to take revenge and preserve the sect's legacy. We can't fight the Ancient God Sect.
一击惊魂咒命中他，他愣神间也被阵法斩杀，尸体瞬间被抽干。¤A shocking spell hit him, and he too was decapitated by the formation as he froze, his body instantly drained.
咳~咳~~~道友，可认识岚诺？¤Cough~cough~~~Daoist, do you know Lanno?
还想着自爆元婴？¤Still thinking of exploding your own baby?
长生难求，总有人想另辟蹊径啊。¤Long life is hard to find, so there are always people who want to find another way.
在你和这怪物纠缠的时候，玄古门弟子已经被斩杀殆尽了，仅剩那名元婴修士。¤While you were tangling with this monster, the Profound Ancient Sect disciples had already been decimated, leaving only the Yuan Ying cultivator.
说罢他身体失去支撑而倒下，气息开始消散，肉身也逐渐崩解。¤With that said his body lost its support and collapsed, his breath began to dissipate and his flesh gradually disintegrated.
此时被你击败的掌门也恢复了理智。¤At this point the paladin you defeated has also regained his senses.
一道神识扫过，你似乎被什么人盯上了...¤A soul sense swept through, you seem to be targeted by something...
站住，此地乃我派驻地，非我{$Var}弟子不得擅入！¤Stop, this is my school's premises, not my {$Var} disciples are not allowed to trespass!
我们从蓬莎岛出发，距离这里最近的当属{color=#d0380a}碎星岛{/color}了。那里由海上最大的商会势力掌控。¤We set off from Pongsha Island, and the nearest one is {color=#d0380a}Broken Star Island{/color}. It is controlled by the largest Merchant Guild on the sea.
蓬莎岛是这无尽之海上远近闻名的散修势力，散修们在这里交换物资与妖兽情报，然后才出海猎杀妖兽。¤Pongsha Island is a well-known independent cultivator power in this endless sea. The independent cultivators exchange materials and information about monsters and beasts before they go out to hunt the beasts.
我从小就在这片海域玩耍，对这里可是熟悉的很，不过...我们是不是走错了方向？¤I've been playing in this sea since I was a kid, and I'm familiar with it, but...have we gone in the wrong direction?
但相传曾有前辈在这片海域利用雷云淬炼肉体，我对此也神往已久，真是了不得的修为！¤But according to legend, there were seniors who used thunderclouds to temper their bodies in this sea area. I have been fascinated by this for a long time. It is an incredible cultivation base!
这里便是浪方海域，因传说中的化神期海兽浪方大圣而得名。¤This is the Langfang sea area, named after the legendary sage of the sea beast Langfang during the Deity Transformation.
家中从未有长辈提及祖上原居住在碎星岛，其中居然有这样的秘辛......¤No elder in the family ever mentioned that his ancestor Uehara lived on Broken Star Island, there is such a secret...
在这片海域出没的吞云蟒，也是海域上最负凶名的海兽之一。以我们现在的修为，在这里还需小心行事。¤The cloud swallowing python that appears in this sea area is also one of the most murderous sea beasts in the sea area. With our current cultivation base, we still need to be careful here.
哈哈哈，既然如此，我们就先去那{color=#d0380a}碎星岛{/color}看看吧。¤Hahaha, in that case, let's go to the {color=#d0380a}Broken Star Island{/color} to have a look.
这里是千流海，据说这片海域被千流岛的连家掌控着，非常神秘。早就听说千流岛神通威能不俗，不知此行能否有机会见识一下。¤This is the Qianliu Sea. It is said that this sea area is controlled by the Lian family of Qianliu Island. It is very mysterious. I have long heard that Qianliu Island's supernatural powers are impressive. I wonder if I have a chance to see it during this trip.
在这片海域出没的巨鲲，也是海域上最负凶名的海兽之一。以我们现在的修为，在这里还需小心行事。¤The giant kunfish that haunts this sea area is also one of the most murderous sea beasts in the sea area. With our current cultivation base, we still need to be careful here.
除此以外，还有像南崖城，碎星岛这样的大岛，各州修士云集，珍宝无数，更会定期举办拍卖会，也是涨见识的好去处。¤In addition, there are also big islands like Nanya City and Broken Star Island, where cultivators from all states gather and there are countless treasures, and auctions are held regularly, which is also a good place to gain insight.
这里是阴冥海，无尽之海上最为神秘危险的海域之一，我对这里也知之甚少...¤This is the Deep Yin Sea, one of the most mysterious and dangerous seas in the endless sea. I don't know much about it either...
我曾听家族长辈说起过无尽之海中的诸多海域，这其中最危险的，莫过于西面的无尽海渊，雷鸣海，以及最南方的玄冥海，阴冥海和幽冥海了。即便修为达到元婴期的大能，也不愿独自一人深入那里。¤I have heard the elders of my family talk about the many seas in the Endless Sea, and there is nothing more dangerous than the Endless Sea Abyss in the west, the Thunder Sea, and the Deep Black Sea, Deep Yin Sea and Deep Hell Sea in the far south. Even great powers with cultivation levels reaching the Nascent Soul stage would be reluctant to go deeper there alone.
无尽海渊...这里的海沟据说是无尽之海已知区域的最深处。我听过不少有关这里的传说，那些最为强悍的深海妖兽都生活在这里。¤Endless Sea Depth... The trench here is said to be the deepest known area of ​​the Endless Sea. I have heard many legends about this place. The most powerful deep sea monsters live here.
这里是西宁海，经常会有一些金丹期修为的海兽出没，比起北宁海可是危险的多。¤This is the West Ning Sea, and there are often some sea beasts of the Jindan stage cultivation base, which is much more dangerous than the Beining Sea.
这里便是南崖海域，大名鼎鼎南崖城就建立这这极南之地。¤This is the South Cliff Sea area, and the famous Nanya City established this extremely southern land.
这里是北宁海，也是宁州的近海，多是一些只有筑基修为的小型海兽出没，没什么危险的。¤This is Beininghai, and it is also the coastal waters of Ning Province. Most of them are small sea beasts that can only be used for foundation building and repair. There is no danger.
我们百里家便是做的这妖兽材料的生意，不过也只是低价从海上收购一些材料，再运回宁州高价卖出而已。¤Our Baili family is doing this monster material business, but it only buys some materials from the sea at a low price, and then transports it back to Ning Province and sells it at a high price.
这里是图南海，这里的灵气乱流尤为危险，但仍然不断有人来这里冒险，为的便是能寻得那传说中的问道花。这种草药可是炼制悟道丹的必需品。¤This is the South Atlas Sea. The turbulent flow of spiritual energy here is particularly dangerous, but there are still people who come here to take risks in order to find the legendary Dao Seeker Flower. This herb is critical in the refinement of Pills of enlightenment.
以我们现在的修为，在这里还需小心行事。¤With our current cultivation base, we still need to be careful here.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，有什么事么？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, what's the matter?
只要跟着这附近的商船行驶，就能抵达那些正在举办交易会的小岛，和岛上的修士交换，补充所需的物资。¤As long as you follow the nearby merchant ships, you can reach the islands where the trade fairs are being held, and exchange with the cultivators on the islands to replenish the necessary supplies.
若是我们百里家的商队能与商会合作，对于双方都是百利而无一害的好事。当年叔父商队遇难之事，我也想好好调查清楚。¤If our Baili family caravan can cooperate with the Merchant Guild, it will be a good thing for both parties. The uncle's caravan was killed in the past, I also want to investigate it carefully.
这无尽之海竟如此宽广，真是不悔此行！¤This endless sea is so wide, I really don't regret this trip!
这里是南宁海，经常会有一些金丹期修为的海兽出没，比起北宁海可是危险的多。¤This is the Nanning Sea, and there are often some sea beasts of the Golden core stage cultivation base, which is much more dangerous than the North Ning Sea.
这里是化龙海，龙族所掌控的海域。¤This is the Dragonborn Sea, the sea controlled by the dragon clan.
这里便是吞云海，因传说中的化神期海兽吞云大圣而得名。¤This is the Sea of ​​Swallowing Clouds, named after the legendary Sea Beast Swallowing Clouds of Deity Transformation.
一般来说，龙族不会主动攻击这里来往的人类商船，但我们最好也不要主动招惹它们。¤Generally speaking, the dragons will not take the initiative to attack the human merchant ships going here, but we better not take the initiative to provoke them.
终于到碎星海域了，据说那碎星岛就位于这片海域的中心地带。¤I finally arrived at the Broken Star Sea. It is said that Broken Star Island is located in the center of this sea.
百里兄，无尽之海这般广阔，你想先去哪里？¤Brother Baili, the endless sea is so vast, where do you want to go first?
这里是幽冥海，无尽之海上最为神秘危险的海域之一，我对这里也知之甚少...¤This is the Deep Hell Sea, one of the most mysterious and dangerous seas in the endless sea. I don't know much about it either...
这雷鸣海被一年四季不间断的雷云所笼罩，就连元婴期修士也难以抵抗，可以说是无尽之海最危险的区域之一。¤This thunderous sea is Shielded by thunderclouds that are uninterrupted throughout the year. Even the cultivators of the Nascent Soul period can hardly resist it. It can be said that it is one of the most dangerous areas in the endless sea.
哈哈哈，我也正想活动活动筋骨，请！¤Hahaha, I also want to move my muscles and bones, please!
这里是东海，都说灵气乱流尤为危险，但仍然不断有人来这里冒险，为的便是能寻得那传说中的三尾风叶！这种草药可是炼制结婴所需丹药的必需品。¤This is the East Sea. It is said that the Qi turbulence here is particularly dangerous, but there are still people who come here to take risks, so that they can find the legendary Windsoul Leaf! This herb is a core ingrediant to synthesize Nascent Soul breakthrough Pills.
最重要的是，这南崖城可是建立在化神期海兽的骸骨之上！想想就令人心潮澎湃。¤The most important thing is that this Nanya city is built on the bones of sea beasts in the Deity Transformation stage! It is exciting to think about it.
这里是玄冥海，无尽之海上最为神秘危险的海域之一，我对这里也知之甚少...¤This is the Deep Black Sea, one of the most mysterious and dangerous seas in the endless sea. I don't know much about it either...
{shixiong}留步，这二楼的秘阁存放的都是我派独门传承的秘籍，只对在我派内的长老和供奉们开放。¤{shixiong} stop right there. The secret pavilion on the second floor stores all the secret books passed down by our school, which is only open to the elders and guest elders in our school.
{shidi}留步，这二楼的秘阁存放的都是我派独门传承的秘籍，只对在我派的长老和供奉们开放。¤{shidi} stay here. The secret pavilion on the second floor stores all the secret books passed down by our school, which is only open to the elders and guest elders in our school.
此前遇到的那些魂体都对岛主颇有微词，看来道友很是信任岛主？¤Those souls we met before were quite critical of the island master, it seems that you trust the island master?
万魂殿此行由他们大长老带队，专门捕捉我们这些魂体，以供她炼制万魂幡。¤The Hall of Ten Thousand Souls was led by their Grand Elder on this trip, specifically to capture us soul bodies for her refinement of the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls.
你可知她具体在何处？那万魂幡究竟又是何物？¤Do you know exactly where she is? What exactly is that Ten Thousand Souls Streamer?
这么说，道友乃是岛主亲信之人？关于复生之术的消息，道友可否透露一二？¤So, you are a person close to the island master? About the news of the art of resurrection, can you reveal one or two things?
至于具体在何处，你将海图给我，我给你指明便是。¤As for where exactly, you will give me the sea map, I will show you is.
她让手下四处布阵收集灵魂，而自己却躲在深海处独自祭炼万魂幡。¤She asked her men to set up formations around to collect souls, while she hid at the deep sea to sacrifice the Ten Thousand Souls Streamer alone.
抱歉，即便你有恩于我，我也断然不能透露此事。¤Sorry, even if you have a favor to me, I absolutely can not disclose this matter.
好险...看来这万魂殿也不是那么好对付的，接下来还是得更加小心才是...¤So close... It seems that the Hall of Souls is not so easy to deal with, so we should be more careful next...
好在此幡还未祭炼完成，道友若想对付此獠，还需尽快出手。¤The good thing is that this streamer has not yet been refined, so if you want to deal with this fang, you still need to do it as soon as possible.
敢问，道友也是为了收集神阴石才冒险来此？¤Dare I ask, do you also risk coming here in order to collect the divine Yin stone?
岛主的良苦用心，也只有我们这些心腹之人知晓了。¤The island master's good intentions, and only we, the beloved people know.
此前的确有打探到不少消息，倒是可以与道友细说一二。¤Previously, there is indeed a lot of prying into the news, it is possible to talk to you in detail.
他略带警惕地看了你一眼。¤He gives you a slightly wary look.
多谢道友相救。我并非为神阴石来此。¤Thank you for saving me, fellow Daoist. I did not come here for the divine Yin Stone.
那些人不曾为阴魂岛出过力，自然要与我等区分对待。¤Those people have not contributed to the Yin Soul Island, so naturally they should be treated differently from us.
此前受岛主之托，来调查魂体失踪一事。只是那阵法当真诡异，我稍一疏忽便被发现了。¤Previously entrusted by the island master to investigate the disappearance of the soul body. Just that formation when really bizarre, I was discovered with a slight oversight.
阵法中飞出了一位相当凝实的魂体。¤A rather solid soul body flew out of the formation.
（他们各执一词，也不知究竟该相信谁…）¤(They each say the same thing, and do not know who to believe...)
还有一事，道友此前可有打探到万魂殿的消息？¤One more thing, have you previously spied on the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls?
顾名思义，那万魂幡便是收集无数冤魂祭炼而出的至邪之物，至于究竟有何威力便不得而知了。¤As the name implies, the ten thousand souls streamer is the collection of countless souls sacrificed to refine the most evil things, as to what exactly is the power is unknown.
那你为何要冒此风险？¤Then why do you want to take this risk?
太好了，我也是慕名而来，想看看能不能交易到一些有用的东西。¤It's great, I'm here too, wanting to see if I can trade some useful things.
道友...道友留步！¤Friends...stay friends stay!
不知道友可是来这里参加交易会的？¤I don't know, but you are here to participate in the trade fair?
无妨无妨，既然如此，在下还是去岛上其它的小店再看一看吧。¤It's okay, if that's the case, let's go to other small shops on the island to have a look.
哈哈哈，多谢道友。¤Hahaha, thank you fellow daoist.
在下还要去岛上的小店看看有没有其它适用的东西，就先走一步了。¤Next, I have to go to the small shop on the island to see if there are other applicable things, so I'll take a step first.
出海的时间长了，身上的补给品难免会不够用，我也是慕名而来，想看看能不能用我不需要的妖兽材料交易到一些有用的东西。¤I have been out to sea for a long time, and the supplies on my body will inevitably be insufficient. I also came here admiringly, wanting to see if I can trade some useful things with the monster materials I don't need.
道友可是前来参与入门测试的？{w}{w=0.5}¤Daoists came to participate in the introductory test? {w}{w=0.5}
如此，一炷香内道友护住自身，不溃败于我的攻势之下便可。¤In this way, a fellow Taoist in a stick of incense can protect himself and not be defeated by my offensive.
“此番值守还真是风平浪静，回去复命吧。”¤This time on duty, it's really calm, let's go back and return to life.
你谨慎的地此地值守，并没有遇到什么可疑之人。¤You watched here carefully, and didn't encounter any suspicious people.
此番值守还真是风平浪静，回去复命吧。¤This time on duty is really calm, let's go back and return to life.
你谨慎地在此地址值守，前方一名门内弟子向你走来，你们互相点头示意。¤You are on duty at this address carefully, and a disciple in front of you walks towards you, and you nod to each other.
你谨慎地在此地值守，似乎有一道隐晦的气息在旁潜伏。¤You are guarding here cautiously, as if there is a vague aura lurking nearby.
你谨慎的在此地值守，风平浪静并没有遇到什么人。¤You are on duty here carefully, and the wind is calm and the waves are calm and you haven't met anyone.
{xiaozi}看招！！¤{xiaozi} look at the move!!
你谨慎的在此地值守，并没有遇到什么可疑之人。¤You are on duty here carefully, and you haven't encountered any suspicious people.
你谨慎地在此地值守，突然间前方一道黑影向你扑来。¤You are guarding here cautiously, and suddenly a dark shadow rushes toward you in front of you.
妖兽？\n¤Monster?\n
就这两下子？¤Just these two things?
哎，不打了不打了，累死老子了。¤Hey, stop fighting, stop fighting, I'm exhausted.
我叫{FirstName}{LastName}，是刚入门的外门弟子。¤My name is {FirstName}{LastName}, and I am an outer disciple who just started.
还有我们离火门弟子配属的道袍，你也拿着吧。¤There is also the Taoist robe that our disciple from the Heavenly Fire Gate belongs to, you can take it too.
这个，这个，哦，还有这个...¤This, this, oh, and this...
诶，明白，明白，来领取入门两件套嘛。你等着，我来找给你。¤Eh, understand, understand, come to receive the two-piece starter set. Wait, I'll find it for you.
嗯...{FirstName}{shidi}，我猜你一定是来领取入门两件套的吧，你等着，让我找找。¤Um... {FirstName}{shidi}, I guess you must have come to receive the two-piece starter set. Wait, let me find it.
{shixiong}，今日来神兵阁有什么事么？{w}{w=0.5}¤{shixiong}, what's the matter in Shenbing Pavilion today? {w}{w=0.5}
你问我蛇妖的位置？我想想....似乎是在天魔眼的{color=#d0380a}东{/color}面吧...¤You asked me the location of the snake demon? I think about it...it seems to be in the {color=#d0380a}East{/color} side of the eyes of the demon...
师兄，我是来领取...¤Brother, I'm here to receive...
听说这天魔眼中还有一只修为极高的蛇妖，普通的筑基期修士都不是它的对手。¤I heard that there is also a snake demon with a very high cultivation level in the eyes of this demon, and ordinary foundation-building cultivators are not its opponents.
（低声）别怪师兄没提醒一句啊，穿上这个你可能会更热...¤(Whispering) Don't blame the brother for not reminding me, you might get hotter with this...
哟，又有新面孔来了？¤Yo, there are new faces here?
{shidi}，这三把符器，你自己挑选一把吧。¤{shidi}, choose one of these three talisman tools.
{FirstName}{shidi}，这三把符器，你自己挑选一把吧。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, these three talisman tools, you can choose one by yourself.
诶？{shixiong}，你不会也对那蛇妖感兴趣吧！？¤Huh? {shixiong}, you won't be interested in that snake monster too!?
这间商铺出售的似乎都是些{$dian}，你决定...？¤This shop seems to sell {$dian}, you decide...?
当然，只要价格合适，我们商会都能吃得下。¤Of course, as long as the price is right, our Merchant Guild can afford it.
道友有所不知，这价格也不是我私下定的，而是由商会根据最近的海况统一制定。¤Friends of Daoists don't know, this price is not set privately by me, but is set by the Merchant Guild based on the recent sea conditions.
不过若是你能拿出我们商会中也比较稀缺的资源，那我们自然也愿意出更高的价格来收购。¤But if you can come up with resources that are also relatively scarce in our Merchant Guild, then we are naturally willing to purchase them at a higher price.
你眼前的是一间用大块岩石简单搭建出来的临时商铺，掌柜正悠闲地坐在里面。¤What you see in front of you is a temporary shop simply built out of big rocks, and the shopkeeper is sitting in it leisurely.
不错，不错。这些灵石现在是你的了。¤Yes, yes. These spirit stones are now yours.
这位道友，看看有什么需要的？{w}{w=0.5}¤This fellow Taoist, see what you need? {w}{w=0.5}
此生有你这样的徒弟，无论如何，我都为你感到骄傲。¤I am proud to have a disciple like you in this life, no matter what.
放心吧魏老，我想我对自己有十足的信心。¤Don't worry Wei Lao, I think I have complete confidence in myself.
哎...我明白你的心意...¤Aye... I know what you mean...
唠叨了这么多年的魏老，此刻却沉默了。他望向你的眼神复杂万分。¤Wei Lao, who has been chattering for so many years, is silent at the moment. He looks at you with a complicated look in his eyes.
你和轩儿一样，都走到了这最后的一步。无论如何，我都为你感到骄傲。¤You, like Xuan'er, have come to this final step. No matter what, I am proud of you.
{xiaozi}，接下来的困难，你只能独自面对了。渡劫凶险异常，你一定要保护好自己，要慎之又慎！¤{xiaozi}, you will have to face the next difficulties alone. Transitioning the tribulation is extremely dangerous, you must protect yourself and be cautious!
这么多年，我早就已经放弃这个念想了...¤After all these years, I've long since given up on the idea...
哎...转眼便过去这么多年，当时那个连吐纳心法都练不好的{xiaozi}，如今却要准备飞升了。¤Aigoo... So many years have passed in the blink of an eye, and the {xiaozi} who couldn't even practice the Exhalation Heart Technique at that time is now preparing to ascend.
{xiaozi}，千万别勉强自己，渡劫绝非儿戏，少几分灵气，也许就是身死道消。¤{xiaozi}, don't force yourself, crossing the tribulation is not a child's play, a few points less aura may be the death of your body.
你盘腿坐下，闭目垂帘，调息静心，那熟悉的动作，熟悉的身影，\r\n与初入仙途时别无二致，但你知道，沧海桑田，早已是天壤之别。¤You sit with your legs crossed, eyes closed and curtains down, adjusting your breath and meditating. The familiar movements, the familiar figure, \r \n are no different from when you first entered the immortal path, but you know that the sea has changed and the world has long since changed.
当年你师兄渡劫时，我便能察觉到，施展这秘术对他有不小的影响。¤Back then, when your senior brother was going through the tribulation, I could detect that the casting of this secret technique had a considerable effect on him.
若你没有十足的把握，我是不会轻易施展那秘术的。¤If you are not completely sure, I will not easily perform that secret technique.
此生...有你这样的徒弟，无论如何，我都为你感到骄傲......¤This life... I'm proud to have a disciple like you, no matter what ......
所以若你没有十足的把握，我是不会轻易施展那秘术的。¤So if you are not completely sure, I will not easily perform that secret technique.
多少化神大能都倒在了飞升这一步，你可不要掉以轻心了。¤How many Deity Transformation masters have fallen at this step of ascension, so don't take it lightly.
这世上有几人能和你一样走到这一步？作为你的师傅，无论如何，我都为你感到骄傲。¤How many people in this world could have come this far as you have? As your master, I am proud of you no matter what.
若非魏老当年将我领入门，我又哪有今日。放心吧，我很快便会帮您重塑肉身的！¤If Elder Wei had not led me to the initiation back then, I would not be here today. Don't worry, I will soon help you rebuild your body!
如果渡劫时遇到任何意外，我都会主动停下秘术，到时你可切勿因此分心。¤If there are any surprises during the tribulation, I will take the initiative to stop the secret technique, so you must not be distracted by it.
魏老，我还得再斟酌一下。¤Mr Wei, I still have to deliberate a bit more.
若非魏老当年将我领入门，我又哪有今日。可惜...我还没能找到帮您重塑肉身的方法。¤If it wasn't for Elder Wei who led me into initiation back then, I wouldn't be here today. Unfortunately... I have not yet been able to find a way to help you reshape your physical body.
此生...有你这样的徒弟，无论如何，我都为你感到骄傲。¤In this life... With a disciple like you, I am proud of you no matter what.
你运功调息，最后一次缜密回顾着已感悟的渡劫秘术，准备渡劫......¤You are tuning in, reviewing the secret techniques you have learned one last time and preparing for the tribulation ......
此时，随着麒麟血的渗透，你感觉到血脉深处的血脉之力正在觉醒与之相应。那是一种上古莽荒力量，你全身散发出旺盛的气血与麒麟之血相融合。¤At this moment, as the blood of the qilin penetrates, you feel the bloodline power deep within your bloodline awakening to correspond with it. It is an ancient mangled power, and your whole body radiates exuberant qi and blood to merge with the blood of the Qilin.
不论如何，还是多谢了。¤Regardless, many thanks.
道友，你这魔神蛊已经发作，你还是先照顾好自己吧。¤Fellow Daoist, this Demon God Compulsion has already taken hold of you, so you'd better take care of yourself first.
刚刚大殿动静不小，我师兄弟和我师父如何？¤There was a lot of commotion in the Great Hall just now, how are my brothers and my master?
此时，随着麒麟血的渗透，你感觉到血脉深处的龙族之力正在觉醒与之相应。你背后印有龙纹显现。¤At this moment, with the penetration of the blood of the Qilin, you feel the power of the Dragons deep in your bloodline awakening to correspond with it. A dragon tattoo appears on your back.
唉，先出去和钟师兄回合吧。¤Alas, let's go out and have a turn with Brother Zhong first.
说完，魔神蛊的反噬和之前与你交手的伤势一同爆发，轩岚诺已经失去了气息。¤Having said that, the devil god compulsion's backlash exploded along with the injuries from the previous fight with you, and Xuan Lanuo had lost his breath.
道友且忍住，灵纹铭刻在掌心必会有些痛楚。¤Please bear with me, as there will be some pain when the spirit mark is engraved on your palm.
咳~师傅，这振兴玄古门终归是场梦啊。¤Cough~ Master, this revitalization of the Profound Ancient Sect is a dream after all.
此时，随着麒麟血的渗透，你感觉到血脉深处的血脉之力正在觉醒与之相应。你全身散发出旺盛的气血与麒麟之血相融合。¤At this moment, as the blood of the Qilin penetrates, you feel the bloodline power deep within your bloodline awakening to correspond with it. Your whole body radiates exuberant Qi and blood to merge with the blood of the Qilin.
我本就不支持重启炼妖散的研究，这条路若不是天赋异禀，常人如何能承受神兽血脉之力？¤I would not have supported the restarting of the study of demon refining scattering, a path that if one is not gifted, how can a regular person withstand the power of the divine beast bloodline?
玄骨！！！¤Xuanbone!!!
自事自知，我已时日无多也没什么好顾忌的了。¤I know my own business, and I have no more time to worry about.
那这血脉里的全部灵力就不要浪费了。¤Then the entire spiritual energy in this bloodline should not be wasted.
灵纹？你这是以自身为“器胚”强化己身？¤Spiritual patterns? Are you using yourself as a ''tool'' to strengthen your body?
嗯？好旺盛的气血，道友竟是上古神魔遗族，那你便能承受这麟血的妖力了。¤Hmm? What an exuberant qi blood, you are actually a relic of an ancient god or demon, so you will be able to withstand the demonic power of this Lin's blood.
也对，可惜了。¤And yes, it's a shame.
噗！！¤Poof!!!
这血脉里的全部灵力就不要浪费了。¤Don't waste all the spiritual energy in this bloodline.
什么！！！¤WHAT!!!
此时我身无长物，就这麒麟血就当作道友帮我的回报。¤At this time, I have nothing in my possession, so I will take this unicorn blood as a reward for your help.
说罢天空中金色的血液向你掌心飞来，你的手掌一阵刺痛。¤With that said golden blood from the sky flies towards your palm and your palm tingles.
道友，以我们这些凡夫俗子的体格很难发挥全力，可惜了。¤Fellow Daoist, it is difficult to exert our full strength with our mortal physique, unfortunately.
没看出来，道友竟是身怀龙族血脉之人，真的很羡慕你。¤I didn't realize that you are a person who carries the dragon bloodline, I really envy you.
不愧是离火门的高徒一点就通。我时间不多了，你要接受我这妖人最后的作品么？¤As expected of a high disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate one point at a time. I am running out of time, are you going to accept my last work as a demon?
但是，以精血铭刻灵纹在身上习得一些妖兽神通却有可能。¤However, it is possible to acquire some Spirit Beast divine abilities by inscribing spiritual patterns on your body with your essence blood.
呵，玄骨以为这魔神蛊就能完全控制我？这麒麟血我必不能让他如愿以偿。¤Heh, Xuan Bone thinks that this Demon God Compulsion will be able to control me completely? I shall not let him have what he wants with this Qilin blood.
嗯？好旺盛的气血，道友应该也是上古遗族之后，那你必能承受这麟血的全部妖力了。¤Hmm? You must be able to withstand the full demonic power of this Lin's blood.
此时，随着麒麟血的渗透，你感觉到些许灵力散溢于空中。¤At this point, as the unicorn blood penetrates, you feel a little spiritual energy spilling into the air.
道友是心有顾忌么。¤Do you have concerns in mind.
但此次我与冲虚长老之事定下后，星宫那边已是再次邀请各大家族，若是相同的状况再上演一次，乃至...¤But this time, after the matter between me and the elder Chongxu was decided, the Xinggong side has invited the major families again. If the same situation is staged again, even...
总之，若是可以还请道友代沐雪阻止心儿，莫要让她闯下大祸。¤In short, if you can ask fellow Daoist to stop Xin'er on behalf of Muxue, don't let her get into trouble.
既然林姑娘心意已决，那我也就不再多说什么了。¤Since Miss Lin's mind is already made up, I won't say anything more.
你将林沐心的计划向林沐雪娓娓道来，从她逃离林府一直到之后的行动，林沐雪也是安静的听着，直到你说完。¤You will tell Lin MuXin's plan to Lin Mu Xue, from her escape from the Lin House to the subsequent actions, Lin Mu Xue also listened quietly until you finished.
林沐雪看到你的出现先是有些戒备，似乎是想起前日于此有一面之缘，这才放松下来。¤When Lin Muxue saw your presence, she was a little wary at first. She seemed to remember that she had a relationship here the day before yesterday, and then she relaxed.
此中矛盾若想解决，总要有人挺身而出。冲虚前辈既愿退让，沐雪自然也是愿为林家做出贡献。劳{FirstName}{daoyou}挂心，沐雪不胜感激。¤If the conflict is to be resolved, someone must come forward. Senior Chongxu is willing to give in, and Mu Xue is naturally willing to contribute to the Lin family. Lao {FirstName}{daoyou} is concerned, and Mu Xue is very grateful.
啊，抱歉，见道友愿意听，沐雪竟自顾自地啰嗦了这么多，耽误道友太多时间，还请见谅。¤Ah, I'm sorry. Seeing that fellow Daoist was willing to listen, Mu Xue was so long-winded by himself that it took too much time for fellow Daoist. Please forgive me.
{FirstName}道友还请稍安勿躁，短则一日，长则半月，必然会解除封城。¤{The first thing you need to do is to take care of yourself.
即便父亲不在乎，星宫的那位就不一样了。据父亲所言，宫主不知何故，一直{color=#d0380a}非常在乎星宫的名声{/color}。¤Even if the father doesn't care, the one in the star palace is different. According to my father, for some reason, the palace lord has always {color=#d0380a} very concerned about the reputation of the star palace{/color}.
期间若是客栈有何怠慢，道友只需找我即可。¤During the period if the inn has any slack, the Taoist only need to find me.
{FirstName}道友，请问有事么？¤{I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to find a partner.
不太清楚，还请林姑娘解惑。¤Not quite sure, please also ask Miss Lin to solve the confusion.
而星宫中其他分支，一是代表星辰尊者原家族血脉的宫主一系，他们向来不会为难林家；其二便是后来加入星宫的供奉之后，其中以星宫大长老为首，近百年来一直对林家执掌天星城收入大权不满，常有摩擦。¤The other branches in the Star Palace, one is the line of the Palace Master who represents the original family line of the Star Exalted One, they have never been difficult for the Lin family; the second is after the guest elders that later joined the Star Palace, which is led by the Grand Elder of the Star Palace, has been dissatisfied with the Lin family's reign of income power in the Heavenly Star City for nearly a hundred years, and there is often friction.
即便父亲不在乎，星宫的那位就不一样了。据父亲所言，宫主不知何故，一直非常在乎星宫的名声。¤Even if the father doesn't care, the one in the star palace is different. According to my father, the Palace Master, for some reason, has always been very concerned about the reputation of the Star Palace.
那道友也应该知道诸位长老也不过是为家族考虑而用心良苦，只是此前冲虚前辈指名要与心儿结为道侣，才有了这出闹剧。现下前辈愿意转而与我结为道侣，以稳固两系关系，自是再好不过。¤The first thing you should know is that the elders are only thinking about the family and have good intentions, but before that, senior Chong Xu named to be a couple with Xin'er, so there was this farce. Now senior is willing to turn to me as a Daoist couple, in order to stabilize the relationship between the two families, since it is the best.
更何况，心儿的方法无非就是想办法破坏此次结侣典礼，前日便已是因心儿临时逃离而导致星宫与林家当着宁州各家族颜面大损。¤What's more, Xin'er's method is nothing more than to find a way to sabotage the marriage ceremony. The day before yesterday, because Xin'er temporarily escaped, Xinggong and the Lin family suffered a great loss in front of the various families in Ning Province.
而这冲虚散人便是星宫大长老座下弟子。¤And this Chongxu scattered people is the Star Palace Grand Elder under the disciple.
所以若是追究起来，只怕连宫主与父亲的关系都会出现裂痕，大长老那边若是有心...¤Therefore, if it is investigated, I am afraid that even the relationship between the palace owner and the father will have a crack. If the elder has the heart...
道友可知林家与星宫的关系？¤Do you know the relationship between the Lin family and the Star Palace?
道友，请问有事么？¤The first thing you need to do is to ask a question.
多谢{FirstName}道友愿意帮助心儿，但家父一直宠爱心儿，她对此中原委料想是不甚清楚。¤Thanks {FirstName}DaoYou are willing to help Xin'er, but my father has been doting on Xin'er, she is expected to be not very clear about this in the original.
星宫乃是千余年前由大名鼎鼎的天星双尊所建，当时此二者都是化神期修为。其中广微仙子便是当代林家家主，所以名义上天星城是由林家与星宫共同管理，但实际上林家也不过是星宫中较为独立的分支。¤The Star Palace was built more than a thousand years ago by the famous Heavenly Star Dual, both of whom were at the Deity Transformation stage. The Immortal Guanwei is the head of the contemporary Lin family, so nominally the Heavenly Star City is jointly managed by the Lin family and the Star Palace, but in fact the Lin family is only a more independent branch of the Star Palace.
那便拜托{FirstName}道友帮忙安抚心儿一番，沐雪感激不尽。¤Then please {FirstName} Daoist friend to help Balanced Xin'er a little, Mu Xue grateful.
现下府内气氛紧张，{FirstName}道友还是不要在此闲逛为好，若是撞上二长老，免不得对你恶语相向。¤The atmosphere inside the house is tense now, {FirstName}Daoist friends should not wander around here, if you bump into the second elder, inevitably you will be bad-mouthed.
林沐雪看见你出现在她身前，似乎是有些惊讶，却并没有过问太多的意思。¤Lin Mu Xue saw you appear in front of her, seems to be a little surprised, but did not ask too much meaning.
所以林家长老也不过是为家族考虑而用心良苦，只是此前冲虚前辈指名要与心儿结为道侣，才有了这出闹剧。现下前辈愿意转而与我结为道侣，以稳固两系关系，自是再好不过。¤So the Lin family elders are only well-intentioned for the sake of the family, but previously, senior Chong Xu named to be a Daoist couple with Xin'er, there is this farce. Now senior is willing to turn to me as a Daoist couple, in order to stabilize the relationship between the two families, since it is the best.
你看到一{SayStcVal=929}，正在袭击宗门弟子。¤You saw a {SayStcVal=929} attacking a sect disciple.
只见她长舒一口气。¤Just see her take a long breath.
弟子知错，多谢长老出手相救。¤I am aware of my mistake and thank you, Elder, for coming to my rescue.
炼器之道，需脚踏实地切记不可冒进，不然下一次就没有我帮你啦。¤You need to be practical and remember not to take any chances, otherwise I won't be there to help you next time.
“是，长老”台下众弟子应和道。¤Yes, Elder, echoed the disciples on the stage.
好了，本次炼器大会到此为止，你们细细体会个中细节正确在炼器之道上走的更远。¤Well, this is the end of the smithing conference, so you can learn the details and go further in the path of smithing.
说罢，你便起火热炉，火焰如你身体的延续一般如臂使指，一件件材料迅速的融化开来凝聚成器胚。¤With that, you start the fire to heat up the furnace, the flames are like a continuation of your body, and one piece of material melts away quickly to coalesce into a vessel.
器胚已经定型，你手恰法诀以灵力铭刻灵纹，一柄上品法宝便出炉了。¤The embryo has been shaped, you will be able to inscribe it with your spiritual power, and a top-grade magic treasure will be ready.
台下弟子多数还在融化材料，不过他们其中有人得心应手也有的手忙脚乱。¤Most of the disciples on the stage are still melting the materials, but some of them are very handy and some are fumbling.
你单手一掐法诀，帮她控制住了器胚中的能量。¤You help her control the energy in the vessel imprint with a single handed spell.
{shixiong}要开始炼器大会么？¤Is {shixiong} going to start the smithing conference?
炼器之道，怎可冒进？器毁之时自己身死也就罢了，殃及同门何其罪过。¤How can we take any chances in the way of making weapons? If the weapon is destroyed, it is only a matter of time before I die.
你看到一名弟子刚刚完成了器胚，但她此时满头大汗，材料融化而成的器胚中灵力几近失控，显然是她私自修改了配方想要炼制法宝但自己又不能控制住器胚的灵力。¤You see a disciple who has just finished a weapon embryo, but she is sweating profusely at the moment, the spiritual power in the embryo made of melted materials is almost out of control, obviously she has modified the recipe privately to make a magic treasure but she cannot control the spiritual power of the embryo herself.
台下弟子皆拱手拜谢，之后有宗门长老收取了你们炼制的法宝。¤The disciples on the stage all bowed their hands in thanks, after which a clan elder collected the magic treasures you had made.
嗯，品相不错¤Well, good quality
一会我会在台上炼制法宝做示范，你们跟着我一步步来炼制法器、符器，宗门资源来之不易，切记不要出了差错。明白么？¤In a moment, I will demonstrate on stage how to make magic treasures, and you will follow me step by step to make magic weapons and talismans. Do you understand?
此时成器不过是时间问题，你便开始留心台下弟子的情况。¤At this point it is only a matter of time before you become a weapon, so you start to keep an eye on the disciples on the stage.
继续吧。¤Go on.
这数十年来宁州倒是风平浪静，没有再发生什么太大事端。只可惜当年...¤In the past few decades, Ning Province has been calm and there hasn't been any major incidents. It's a pity that...
我派这一代的弟子中，除了青麟便再找不出几个好一点的苗子了。¤Among the disciples of my generation, apart from Qinglin, I can't find any better seedlings.
真是气煞老夫！！！¤What an angry old man!!!
晚辈想起还有些事情未处理完，先行告辞了。¤The younger generation remembered that there were still some things that had not been dealt with, so I said goodbye first.
你们看着二长老一会儿踱步一会儿叹气，一会儿录玉简一会儿放信鸽，忙活了大半天总算坐在太师椅上。¤You watched the second elder pacing for a while, sighing, recording the jade slip for a while and releasing the pigeons, and after working for most of the day, you finally sat on the chair of the master.
家丑不可外扬，家丑不可外扬啊！¤The ugliness of the family cannot be publicized, and the ugliness of the family cannot be publicized!
倪旭欣被吓得不敢吱声，轻轻地捅了捅你耳语道¤Ni XuXin was so scared that she did not dare to speak, she gently poked you and whispered.
你虽好奇，但也不便掺和倪家的家事，找了个借口回到了客房。¤Although you are curious, you can't mix with the Ni family's housework, so you found an excuse to go back to the guest room.
除非我爹在外面有别的道侣......不然我想应该是没有的。¤Unless my dad has other Taoists out there...or I don't think there should be any.
怎么突然打听起戮仙剑的消息了？¤Why do you suddenly inquire about Immortal Executing Sword?
我看我们要不还是先溜吧......¤I think we should slip first...
你们一五一十地把整个调查过程说给了二长老，眼看着他的脸色从青到紫又从紫到黑。¤You told the whole investigation process to the second elder one by one and watched his face change from blue to purple and from purple to black.
居然做出谋害大哥这种大逆不道的事情！真是混账东西！¤You actually did something like murdering your big brother! What a bastard!
敢问长老到底发生了何事？¤Dare to ask the elder what happened?
你俩对视无言，只觉大难临头恨不得挖个地洞赶快跑掉。¤You two were silent at each other, just feeling that the disaster is imminent and you want to dig a hole and run away.
你还有兄长吗？¤Do you still have a brother?
单击{color=#d0380a}战前准备{/color}\r可以调整装备、服用丹药、更改功法与神通的搭配。\n¤Click {color=#d0380a}Combat Preparation{/color}\rto adjust your equipment, take potions, and change the mix of technique and Skills you will use。\n
嗯，能长到这般体型，就算还未结成妖丹，也不是普通凡人能对付的了的。我观这巨蟒应该与你修为相当，拿来给你练手倒是刚好合适。¤Well, to grow to this size, even if it has not yet formed a demon core, it is not something that ordinary mortals can deal with. I guess this boa is comparable to your cultivation level. Just about right for practice.
嗯？那草里盘着的是...好大的一条蟒蛇！¤Hmm? What's in the grass ... What a big boa!
整理一下装备，好好回忆回忆老夫之前教的神通法诀，实战无儿戏，做好万全准备，{xiaozi}当心点！¤Sort out your equipment, and remember the the cultivation techniques I taught you not a while ago. Real fight is no joke, so be fully prepared, {xiaozi} be careful!
覆海大圣来到你们面前。¤The Great Sage of the Overturned Sea comes before you.
你从闭关之地出来，看到龙宫大阵全力运转，龙墓之中源源不断的迸发出纯粹的生机一股先天仙灵之气在其中波动，敖玄面色凝重地立于半空之中的阵眼位置主持阵法。¤You come out from the place of seclusion and see the Dragon Palace Formation in full operation, the Dragon Tomb is constantly bursting with pure vitality an innate immortal spirit Qi fluctuates in it, Ao Xuan's face is gloomy as he stands in mid-air at the position of the eye of the formation to preside over the formation.
浪方老贼毙于你手，鲲族余孽现在是一盘散沙。按理说今日不会有人前来捣乱。¤With the death of the old thief Nang Fang at your hands, the remaining members of the Kun Clan are now a scattered mess. It is reasonable to assume that no one will come to cause trouble today.
你去吧，最近龙墓会封闭，如非灭族大事不要来打扰我。¤Go ahead, the Dragon's Tomb will be closed recently, so don't bother me if it's not a clan extermination event.
九幽、浪方皆毙于你手，现在的和平哪里是他们怕了我龙族，他们是给你面子才对。¤The Nine Yous and the Longfang were all killed by your hand. The current peace is not because they are afraid of my Dragons, they are giving you face.
你去收拾了那条小鱼吧，最近龙墓会封闭，如非灭族大事不要来打扰我。¤Go and clean up that little fish. The Dragon's Tomb will be closed recently, so don't bother me if it's not a clan extermination event.
你小子很不错，资质比九玄那小子都好。¤You're a good kid, with better qualifications than even that Jiu Xuan kid.
说罢，你将自己的气息放开，一股恐怖的化神威压笼罩了龙宫附近的海域，一时间风平浪静，无人干扰。¤Saying this, you let go of your aura and a terrifying Deity Transformation pressure envelops the sea near the Dragon Palace, and for a while the wind and waves are calm and undisturbed.
唉，事关家父做儿子的总归是放心不下。不过，有你这位“威名赫赫”的高手陪我确实是很令人安心呢。¤I can't help but feel relieved that my father is involved. However, it is very reassuring to have you, a ''renowned'' master, with me.
恭喜父亲。¤Congratulations to Father.
说罢覆海大圣化作一道遁光没入龙宫深处，敖玄上来对你道谢。¤After saying this, the Oversea Sage turned into a disappearing light and went deep into the Dragon Palace, Ao Xuan came up to thank you.
这是我个人的收藏，请收下以表谢意。¤This is my personal collection, please accept it as a token of my appreciation.
多谢老祖相助。¤Thank you for your help, Old Master.
敖玄道友不必如此紧张。龙族威名远扬，龙宫更是依托大阵固若金汤哪有宵小之辈赶来进犯。¤There is no need to be so nervous, Daoist Ao Xuan. The Dragon Clan's reputation is well known and the Dragon Palace is even more solid with its great formation.
你是担心剩下两位？¤Are you worried about the remaining two?
说是漫长其实不过几息之间。¤To say that it is long is actually only a few breaths.
“吼~~”浪方连翻轰击大阵。¤'Roar~~'' Lang Fang continuously flipped and blasted the great formation.
说完覆海大圣对你抱拳作揖。¤After saying this the Oversea Sage gives you a fist bump.
多谢道友，我长年闭关，道友为我龙宫奔波操劳此次又是为我护法。¤Thank you very much, I have been in seclusion for many years, and you have been running around for us Dragon Palace, and this time you are guarding me.
此时异变突发，龙脉之中的生机一扫而空陷入了死机，但转瞬间一股强大的化神气息迸发而出。¤At this moment, a sudden change occurred and the vitality in the dragon vein was swept away into a deadly state, but in an instant a powerful aura of Deity Transformation burst forth.
水面之上巨眼露出嘲讽的看着发话的敖玄，不过他很快就看到你了他瞳孔骤缩，一股化神期的神识笼罩着你，似是在思考什么。¤Above the surface of the water giant eyes reveal mockery looking at the snapping Ao Xuan, but he soon saw you his pupils suddenly shrink, a divine consciousness of the Deity Transformation stage enveloped you, seems to be thinking about something.
你平静的与这海中巨兽对峙，对方似是察觉了什么不敢贸然出手。\n¤You calmly confront this giant beast of the sea, the other side seems to have sensed what is going on and does not dare to make a rash move. \n
我先回大殿了，道友若是有事可以来找我。¤I will go back to the Great Hall, so if you have anything to do, you can come and find me.
嗯，辛苦你了。¤Well, hard work for you.
唉，事关家父做儿子的总归是放心不下。不过，有你这位大高手陪我确实是很令人安心呢，哈哈哈。¤I can't help but feel relieved when it's my father's business. However, it is indeed reassuring to have a great master like you with me, hahaha.
大圣还请自便。¤The Great Sage is also at liberty to make himself at home.
你莫要调笑我啦。¤Don't tease me.
正想挑战九幽大圣，择日不如撞日，咱们比划比划？¤I'd like to challenge the Great Sage of the Nine Mysteries, why don't we have a match?
远处一股庞大的妖气飞快的靠近，在龙宫之外停下。你与敖玄于半空中与之对峙。你清晰的看到水面之下舞动的巨型触手，一对硕大的眼睛露出水面看着你们。¤In the distance a huge demonic aura flies close and stops outside the Dragon Palace. You and Ao Xuan confront it in mid-air. You can clearly see the giant tentacles dancing beneath the surface of the water, a pair of huge eyes peeking out at you.
这次多谢道友了，以后若是有什么需要我龙宫相助的，我们必鼎力相助。¤Thank you very much for this time. If there is anything we can do to help you in the future, we will do our utmost to help you.
或是紧张或是愤怒，敖玄把讨教二字咬的极重。¤Either nervously or angrily, Ao Xuan put a lot of weight on the word ''seek advice''.
敖玄祭出九龙玺，你将灵力也注入其中，阵法还算是稳定下来。¤Ao Xuan sacrificed the Nine Dragon Seal and you injected your spiritual energy into it, and the formation was still considered stable.
一时间风平浪静，仅有来自龙宫的灵气波动一起一伏。¤The wind was calm for a while, with only the aura fluctuations from the Dragon Palace ebbing and flowing together.
远处一只巨大的鲲飞快的靠近，撞角撞击在龙宫的防御大阵的光幕上。光幕一阵明暗波动，不过一息之间就恢复正常了。不过你注意到敖玄脸色一白。¤In the distance a huge Kun flew close and its ramming horns struck the light curtain of the Dragon Palace's defence array. The light curtain fluctuated in light and darkness for a while, but it returned to normal in a breath. But you notice that Ao Xuan's face turns white.
不行，以我的修为纵使有九龙玺也难以维持，来助我一臂之力。¤No, with my cultivation level even with the Nine Dragon Seal it is difficult to maintain it, come and help me.
果然，这狗贼必不会放过今天的机会。¤Sure enough, the dog thief will not let the day go by.
“轰轰”，大阵外阵阵恐怖能量波动散开。不过很快就趋于平静了。\n¤'Boom boom'', a burst of terrifying energy fluctuations scattered outside the grand formation. But it soon tended to calm down. \n
来者可是九幽前辈？今日乃是我龙宫的大日子恕不接客，前辈若是有事还请回吧，他日家父必亲自上门讨教。¤Is the visitor Senior Jiu You? If you have something to do, please go back. My father will come to my home to teach you in person.
此次突破我损耗巨大，要闭关稳固境界。¤This breakthrough has cost me a lot and I have to close down to stabilise my realm.
来了。¤Coming.
唉，事关家父做儿子的总归是放心不下。不过，有你这位高手陪我确实是很令人安心呢。¤I can't help but feel relieved that my father is involved. However, it is very reassuring to have you with me as an expert.
嗯。（看来这敖玄也不是完全放心今天的事。）¤Hmm. (It seems that this Ao Xuan is not entirely at ease with what happened today.)
不过我也没有太担心，浪方老贼都不是你对手这只章鱼今日又岂能造次。¤But I am not too worried, the old thief Nangfang is not even your opponent this octopus will not be able to make a move today.
浪方老贼上次未分胜负，这次我们再来比划比划！¤The old thief Nang Fang didn't win last time, let's have a match this time!
随着覆海的突破，外围的观望的九幽也是退去，覆海大圣来到你们面前。¤With the breakthrough of the Oversea, the Nine Mysteries watching from the periphery also retreated, and the Oversea Great Sage came before you.
说来就来，正主到了。¤When all is said and done, the main event has arrived.
吞云海那位素来与世无争，但是那只章鱼就不一样了，家父正值关键之时，难免他不会动什么歪心思。¤The one who swallowed the clouds and the sea has always been uncontested, but that octopus is different. My father is at a critical time, so it is inevitable that he won't have any bad intentions.
我安排她在另一处祖地值守了。¤I have arranged for her to be on guard at another ancestral site.
不过瘾，这老贼过了几招就走了。¤Not overjoyed, this old thief went off after a few moves.
此时，龙脉之中的生机一扫而空陷入了死机，但转瞬间一股强大的化神气息迸发而出。¤At this moment, the vitality in the dragon vein was swept away into deadness, but in an instant a powerful aura of Deity Transformation burst forth.
这时，龙脉之中的生机一扫而空陷入了死机，但转瞬间一股强大的化神气息迸发而出。¤At this point, the vitality in the dragon vein swept away into a deadly state, but in an instant a powerful aura of Deity Transformation burst forth.
无须言谢。¤No words of thanks are necessary.
我代师兄多谢白鹿真人愿来观礼。¤On behalf of my senior brother, I would like to thank the real White Deer for his willingness to come and observe the ceremony.
你的事，我自会相助。¤I will help you in your affairs.
哦？白鹿真人和师兄是有何渊源么？¤Oh? Is there a connection between the White Deer and my brother?
前辈请先休息，我去通知师兄一声。¤Please rest for now, senior, I will go and inform my senior brother.
见过白鹿前辈，多谢前辈愿来观礼。¤Greetings to Elder White Deer, and many thanks for your willingness to come and observe the ceremony.
白帝的要求，我不会拒绝。¤I will not refuse the request of the White Emperor.
{FirstName}供奉，这几日在府中过得可好？¤Guest elder {FirstName} , how have you been in the mansion these few days?
又是新的一天，看来宁王暂时还没给你安排任务，你决定...¤It's another day. It seems that Ning King hasn't arranged a task for you yet, you decide...
府内一切都好，我很满意。¤Everything in the house is fine, I am very satisfied.
管事今日来找我，可是宁王给我安排了什么任务？¤The steward came to see me today, but what task did Ning King arrange for me?
府内的一切起居用品都无比奢华，你舒舒服服地休息了一整天，只觉得自己神清气爽。¤All the daily necessities in the mansion are extremely luxurious. You rested comfortably all day, just feeling refreshed.
不错，{FirstName}供奉，还请随我来。¤Yes, Guest elder {FirstName}, please come with me.
几经周转，你终于来到了供奉的居所。逸风城本就以金碧二色为主，给人以堂皇大气之感，此处更是美轮美奂，极尽穷奢之能事。看来宁王暂时还没给你安排任务，你决定...¤After several twists and turns, you finally came to the place for guest elders. Yifeng City was originally dominated by two colors of gold and green, giving people a sense of grandeur, and it is even more beautiful and extravagant. It seems that Ning King hasn't arranged a task for you yet, you decide...
前面那个，快出手拦住他！¤The one in front, step in and stop him!
杜老二急切的声音，让你意识到情况万分危急。而麻老九见状却笑了起来。¤Du Lao Er's eager voice makes you realise that the situation is extremely critical. And Ma Laojiu smiles at the sight.
两位金丹期修士的威压，让你差点喘不过气来。¤The pressure of two Jindan stage cultivators almost takes your breath away.
虽然禾山派无恶不作，但你好歹曾经也是禾山派的一员。究竟要不要趁此机会划清界限？你犹豫了起来。¤Although the Wo Shan Sect is notorious for its evil deeds, you were at least once a member of the Wo Shan Sect. Should you take this opportunity to draw a clear line or not? You hesitate.
算了算了，你走吧，别挡道。¤Forget it, just go away and get out of the way.
唉…算了算了，今天我们就当没见过吧。¤Sigh...forget it, let's pretend we haven't seen it today.
说罢，他便带着一众小弟转身离去。¤With that, he turned and left with a group of minions.
桀桀桀，我当来了个什么帮手。臭{xiaozi}，识趣的话就赶紧让开。¤Jie Jie Jie, I'll assume what a helper has come. Stinky {xiaozi}, get out of the way if you're sensible.
两股强大的气息正朝你迅速逼近，你还未来得及躲闪，他们便发现了你的身影。¤Two powerful auras are rapidly approaching you, and they spot you before you have time to dodge.
我来会会你。¤I've come to meet you.
杜兄此前待我不薄，就算你已是金丹期，我也不能坐视不理。¤Brother Du has treated me well before, and even if you are already at the Golden Dan stage, I can't just sit back and watch.
{xiaozi}，现在沂山派也散了，你不会真要得罪我们禾山派吧？¤{xiaozi}, now that the Yishan School has also broken up, you don't really want to offend our WoShan School, do you?
见曾经的小弟恰好在此，麻老九便吩咐了起来。¤Seeing that his former junior brother happened to be here, Ma Laojiu ordered up.
既然沂山派已不复存在，我自然没有出手的理由。¤Since the Yishan School has ceased to exist, I naturally have no reason to strike.
他所释放出的威压，赫然已是金丹水准，这让你的选择更加艰难了起来。¤The pressure he released was clearly at the level of a Jindan, which makes your choice even more difficult.
原来是{FirstName}{xiongdi}，快帮忙拦住他！¤So it's {FirstName}{xiongdi}, help stop him!
这…实不相瞒，当初你教我的那些功法，我也都参悟过，但这抓人练功，不是各大势力明令禁止之事嘛？¤But isn't the capture of people for training something that is explicitly forbidden by the major powers?
你现在当好心人，桀桀，等以后寿元到了修为却不够的时候，看有没有好心人来帮你。¤You be a good samaritan now, Jie Jie, and when your life expectancy is reached later but your cultivation is not enough, see if there are any good samaritans to help you.
桀桀桀，区区一个筑基修士，还真以为找到帮手了？我们上。¤Jie Jie, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, you really think you've found a helper? Let's go.
虽然并不是什么值钱物件，不过对于筑基境界而言，这些东西也算是可堪一用了。¤Although they are not valuable objects, they can be considered useful for the Foundation Establishment realm.
但…难道就不能靠刻苦修炼觅得长生？为何一定要加害于无辜之人呢？¤But...can't one find immortality through hard work? Why must it be done to innocent people?
“乖乖束手就擒，便少让你吃些苦头，如何？”¤'How about if you give up your hand, you'll suffer less?''
杜兄，我要怎么帮你？¤Brother Du, how can I help you?
我早已退出禾山派，此事与我已无瓜葛。¤I have long since withdrawn from the Harvest Hill School and this matter is no longer my concern.
你没有理会，转过身继续自己的旅程。¤You ignore it and turn around to continue your journey.
你略施神通干扰一二，颜老怪一行人便抓住机会追了上来，将杜老二团团围住。¤When you interfere for a moment or two with your magical powers, Old Monster Yan and his party seize the opportunity to catch up and surround Du Lao Er.
你退至一旁，他们一行人也没有停留，继续追杜老二去了。¤You retreated to one side, and without stopping, their party went on after Du Lao Er.
不远处，一群禾山派修士正追着一人向你跑来。那人伤势极重，脸色惨白，眼看便要殒命于此。¤Not far away, a group of Mt. Harvest Sect cultivators are running towards you after a man. The man is badly injured, his face is pale and he looks like he is going to die.
桀桀桀，这才像话！¤Jie Jie, that's more like it!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}！快来助我一臂之力！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}! Come and help me out!
说罢，他便转身加入到了围攻杜老二的队伍中。¤With that, he turned around and joined the group besieging Du Lao Er.
“省省吧，你当真觉得能跑掉？”¤'Save it, do you really think you can get away with it?''
{xiongdi}这次出力不少，这些就归你了。¤{xiongdi} has contributed a lot this time, so these are yours.
杜老二急切的声音，让你意识到情况万分危急。而麻老九见状也威胁了起来。¤Du Lao Er's eager voice makes you realise that the situation is extremely critical. And Ma Lao Jiu sees the threat.
事成之后，麻老九将杜老二浑身上下搜罗了一道，向你扔了一个储物袋过来。¤After the deed was done, Ma Laoji searched all over Du Laoji's body and threw a storage bag over to you.
你没有说话，只是摇了摇头。¤You didn't say anything, you just shook your head.
桀桀桀，不愿意说就算了。¤Jie Jie, forget it if you don't want to talk about it.
定睛一看，原来是禾山派众人正在追杀杜老二。¤Fixing his eyes, it turned out to be the Wo Shan School crowd who were chasing after Du Lao Er.
哼，区区一个筑基修士，还真以为找到帮手了？我们上。¤Hmph, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, you really think you've found a helper? Let's go.
我牵制住麻老九，你将其他人对付了，再来跟我一起对付他。¤I will hold Ma Laojiu in check, you will deal with the others and then come and deal with him with me.
这位道友，现在沂山派也散了，你不会真要得罪我们禾山派吧？¤Fellow Daoist, now that the Yishan School has also broken up, you don't really want to offend our Wo Shan School, do you?
哼，那就看你够不够格了。¤Hm, that depends on whether you are good enough.
我知道你已经跑路很久了，不过以你筑基的实力，不如考虑一下跟我回禾山继续干如何？¤I know you've been on the run for a long time, but with your foundation building strength, how about considering coming back to WoShan with me to continue your work?
哪有什么机缘，只是碰巧成功突破罢了。¤There is no chance, it just happens to be a successful breakthrough.
麻老九凑近身来，放低了声音。¤Ma Laojiu leaned in close and lowered his voice.
哼，不知死活的东西。¤Hmph, something that doesn't know what it's doing.
不出手就闪开，别挡了老子的道。¤Get out of the way or get out of the way of the old man.
颜老怪蹬了你一眼。¤Yan Laoqi stomps on you.
我牵制住颜老怪，你将其他人对付了，再来跟我一起对付他。¤I will hold Old Monster Yan in check, you will deal with the others and then come and deal with him with me.
定睛一看，原来是禾山派众人正在追杀{$杜老二自适应称呼}。¤Fixing his eyes, it turned out to be the Wo Shan School crowd who were chasing {$Du Lao Er adaptive appellation}.
现在沂山道也散了，没了那群瘪三，咱们抓人练功还不是手到擒来？桀桀桀！¤Now that Yishan Dao has been dispersed, without those yakuza, we can catch people and practice our kung fu easily. Jie Jie Jie!
“当初除掉双鬼只想是为民除害，顺便得个宝贝，没想倒是让禾山派一家独大了起来…”¤'At first, I only wanted to get rid of the twin ghosts for the sake of the people and get a treasure in the process, but I didn't think I would let the Wo Shan Sect become a monopoly...''
算你识趣。我们上！¤You've got the sense. Let's go!
你知道，禾山上就没几个筑基，你去向大统领表个忠心，到时候好处肯定少不了你的。¤You know, there aren't many Foundation Builders on Mount Wo, so if you go and show your loyalty to the Grand Commander, you'll definitely get the benefits when the time comes.
你也不想想，修炼的好去处全被五大派四大家族那帮土皇帝占了，资质好的也全在他们那，咱们这些散修想出头，还能怎么办？¤You don't think about it, the good places for cultivation are all taken up by the five sects and the four clans, and those with good qualifications are all with them, so what can we, the independent cultivators, do if we want to make a name for ourselves?
你略施神通干扰一二，麻老九一行人便抓住机会追了上来，将杜老二团团围住。¤When you interfere for a moment or two with your magical powers, Ma Laojiu and his party seize the opportunity to catch up and surround Du Laoji.
诶，这就是你想太多了。人不为己天诛地灭，修行的世界本就是弱肉强食，哪来的那么多条条框框？¤Eh, this is where you think too much. The world of cultivation is originally about the weak and the strong, so where are the rules and regulations?
说起来，这么久不见，你的气息又变强了不少，莫不是遇到了什么机缘？¤Speaking of which, after not seeing you for so long, your aura has become quite strong again, did you encounter some kind of chance?
哈哈哈，这下看你怎么跑。¤Hahahaha, let's see how you run now.
麻老九眯着眼打量了你一眼。¤Ma Lao Jiu squints at you with narrowed eyes.
正在颜老怪一行人对杜老二进行围攻之时，麻老九悄悄凑了过来。¤While Old Monster Yan's group was laying siege to Du Lao Er, Ma Lao Jiu quietly came over.
桀桀桀，这才像话。我们上！¤Jie Jie, that's more like it. Let's go!
“没了沂山派制衡，他们只怕更肆无忌惮了…结丹以后还是想想办法吧。”¤'Without the checks and balances of the Yishan School, they will only become more unscrupulous... It's better to think of something after the JieDan.''
杜兄此前待我不薄，此事我自不会坐视不理，禾山的各位今日还是请回吧。¤Brother Du has treated me well before, so I will not sit idly by and watch this matter.
禾山派修士一拥而上，杜老二没支撑一会便败下阵来。¤The cultivators of the Wo Shan School swarmed over them and Du Lao Er was defeated before he could support himself for a while.
见有人恰好在此，颜老怪便毫不客气地吩咐了起来。¤Seeing that someone happened to be here, Old Monster Yan ordered without ceremony.
我派护山大阵依托于这火山而布，因此仅需数量不多的灵核便能维持日常的运转。¤Our sect's defensive array rely on this volcano, so only a small number of elemental cores are needed to maintain daily operations.
结丹与筑基不同，若是金丹品阶太差，以后就很难再突破到元婴期了。¤The pill formation is different from the foundation building. If the golden core grade is too bad, it will be difficult to break through to the Nascent Infant stage in the future.
不过这次多亏了有你帮忙，我才能这么顺利的找到线索。¤But thanks to your help this time, I was able to find the clue so smoothly.
想必后面的事情爹和大长老一定会妥善处理好的，那星宫的冲虚长老应该也没有脸面再来提亲了。¤Presumably, Dad and Grand Elder will take care of the rest of the matter properly. The Chongxu elder of the Star Palace should have no face to come to propose marriage.
没想到爹居然出关了，通羽长老真是的，怎么也不和我说。¤I didn't expect Dad to leave the customs. Elder Tong Yu is really true. He didn't tell me why.
通羽长老刚刚让我把这些转交给你，说是感谢你替林家拔除了蛀虫。¤Elder Tong Yu just asked me to transfer these to you, saying that he thanked you for removing the worms for the Lin family.
会长在商会内部拥有很大的权力，所以每次换选除了会长与长老会内部选出候选人外，各族都要额外选出数名金丹及和婴期修士参与投票。¤The president has a lot of power within the Merchant Guild, so each change of election in addition to the president and the elders elected candidates within the Council, the clans have to elect several additional jindan and and infant cultivators to participate in the vote.
家族后分为吴家与百里家，后又加入了唐家与白家，才有如今的局面。¤The family was later divided into the Wu and Baili families, and later the Tang and Bai families were added to the family before it became what it is today.
{FirstName}供奉找我何事？¤Guest elder {FirstName}, what's the matter?
哼，我看这唐平是忘了当年唐家是怎么加入商会的。若让此人当上会长，难免以此缘由私自挪用商会资源，我可信不过他。¤Humph, I think this Tang Ping is forgetting how the Tang family joined the Merchant Guild. If you let this person become the president, it is inevitable that this reason for private misappropriation of Chamber resources, I can not trust him.
碎星商会乃是万年前鹤真人所创，鹤真人突破化神后隐居深海闭关修炼，商会便由其家族继承。¤The Broken Star Merchant Guild was created ten thousand years ago by True Crane, True Crane breakthrough Deity Transformation after living in seclusion in the deep sea to cultivate, the Merchant Guild will be inherited by his family.
现如今唐家所用神通“鹤回翔”便是当年鹤真人的成名招数。¤The Tang family now uses the divine ability 'Flying Crane' is the famous move of the crane real back then.
只是白家素来保持中立，也极少直接参与商会管理权位的争夺。可惜这次比试没能获胜，想换取他们的支持恐怕很难...¤It's just that the Bai Family has always been neutral and rarely participates directly in the battle for the management of the Chamber. Unfortunately, they didn't win this competition, so I'm afraid it will be difficult to get their support in return...
我们已经给各族长老发送了传音符，大家应该会在一两年内陆续赶回南崖城参与这次投票。¤We have already sent a sound transmission talisman to the elders of the clans, and everyone should be rushing back to South Cliff City one after another in a year or two to participate in this vote.
只是白家素来保持中立，也极少直接参与商会管理权位的争夺。好在这次比试我们赢了，应该能换取他们的支持。¤It's just that the White Family has always remained neutral and rarely participates directly in the battle for the management position of the Merchant Guild. The good thing is that we won this competition, we should be able to exchange for their support.
唐家长老唐平一贯主张集商会的资源着重培养族内弟子，反对用商会资源拉拢外族之人，更是对我们吴家招揽供奉的事指手画脚。¤Tang family elder Tang Ping has always advocated that the resources of the Merchant Guild should mainly be used on training the disciples of the clan, instead of bringing in people from outside the clan. He also likes to point fingers at us Wu family recruiting guest elders.
当年唐家的祖先本只是百里家的一名供奉，因善于炼器而被商会重用，而后得以加入长老会，唐家才成为共同管理商会的家族之一。¤Back then, the ancestor of the Tang family was originally just a guest elders of the Baili family and was reused by the Merchant Guild because he was good at smithing, and then was able to join the Council of Elders before the Tang family became one of the families that co-managed the Merchant Guild.
白家主要负责商会内部灵舟的炼制，白家长老白灵冰更是当世为数不多有能力炼制六品灵舟之人，在商会内地位极高。¤The White family is mainly responsible for the refining of the chamber's internal spirit boats, and the White family elder, Bai Lingbing, is one of the few people in the world who is capable of refining a sixth-rate spirit boat, and has a very high status within the chamber.
咦，这位好像也是我白帝楼子弟吧，怪不得身上的气息让老朽觉得很亲近。¤Huh, this one seems to be my White Emperor Pavillion son as well, no wonder the aura on his body makes the old man feel close to him.
真正能全身而退的，仅有现在飘在海上的两人。¤The only ones who really managed to get out in one piece were the two who are now floating on the sea.
但这个月的无尽之海却异于常日。先有难得一见的图南漩涡重现海上，再是原本能持续数年的漩涡就这么突兀的消失了。¤But this month's Endless Sea was different from the usual days. First, there is a rare South Tu Whirlpool reappeared on the sea, and then the original vortex that could last for several years just disappeared so abruptly.
罢了，还是先回南崖城吧，省得引吞云等妖物前来夺宝。待他俩醒转过来，再做询问也不迟。¤Just, it's better to go back to South Cliff City first, so as not to attract the swallowing clouds and other demonic creatures to come and take the treasure. When they both wake up, it's not too late to make inquiries again.
阿欣这孩子都元婴期了还是这么莽撞，哎，还好没出事，倒也是因祸得福吧，竟能从中得到天道果。¤The child is still so reckless, hey, fortunately nothing happened, but it is also a blessing in disguise, it was able to get the Heavenly Dao fruit from it.
{FirstName}{LastName}和倪旭欣。¤{The firstName}{LastName} and Ni XuXin.
咦？这位又是谁，虽不是我白帝楼门人，但身上的气息竟让老朽觉得亲近。¤Huh? Who is this one again? Although he is not a member of my White Emperor Pavillion, the aura of his body actually makes the old man feel close to him.
阿欣这孩子都元婴期了还是这么莽撞，哎，还好没出事。¤Ah Xin this child is YuanYing stage is still so reckless, hey, fortunately nothing happened.
不，也许还是有人足够幸运能脱离漩涡，但也陷入幻觉难以自拔。¤No, maybe there are still people lucky enough to get out of the vortex, but also fall into illusions that are difficult to extricate themselves from.
图南海应该是无尽之海中，较为平静的一个海域了。没有什么势力争斗，也没有特殊妖兽。¤Figure South China Sea should be the endless sea, a relatively Balanced sea. There is no power struggle, and no special Spirit Beasts.
哎，老朽这一生花了太多时间寻找魔剑，白帝楼都是振东在管理，真是辛苦他了。¤Hey, the old man has spent too much time searching for the magic sword in this life, the White Emperor Pavillion is managed by Zhendong, it's really hard on him.
罢了，还是先回南崖城吧，待他俩醒转过来，再做询问也不迟。¤It's just that it's better to go back to South Cliff City first, and when they both wake up, it's not too late to make inquiries.
如今，这俩人却都是身受重伤，在这海面上随波浮沉着。所幸在这禁地之中，少有修士和妖兽。¤Now, these two people are seriously injured, floating with the waves on the surface of the sea. Fortunately, in this forbidden land, there are few cultivators and Spirit Beasts.
原本泡在海水中的俩人也是被托举在半空中。近旁更是有一位衣着朴素的老者正在检查两者的伤势。¤The two people who were originally soaked in seawater were also held up in mid-air. Nearby is a plainly dressed old man is checking the injuries of both.
忽的一阵罡风袭来，原本汹涌不已的海面竟是被压制得了无波澜，像是被一剑横斩开来，只留下了平整的镜面。¤Suddenly a wind came, the original raging sea was actually suppressed without waves, like a sword cross-cutting, leaving only a flat mirror surface.
当然，图南海的修士也不会太了解这个，产生漩涡的这片海域对他们而言早已是禁地，毕竟漩涡出现时还停留在这片海域的修士都已经陨落于海底。¤Of course, Tu Nanhai cultivators will not know too much about this, this sea where the whirlpool was created has long been forbidden to them, after all, the whirlpool appeared when the cultivators who still stay in this sea have fallen to the bottom of the sea.
嗤！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Snort! {vpunch=10,0.5}
你进入幻阵，周围的云雾在一阵搅动以后，开始慢慢凝聚成为人形。幻象越聚越多...突然，一个幻象向你扑了过来！¤You enter the illusion, and the surrounding clouds and mist begin to condense into a human form after a while. The illusions gather more and more... Suddenly, an illusion rushes at you!
各位兑换完后，这天机大比便算是收场了，在下也就不叨扰了。¤After you all have finished exchanging, this Heavenly Machine Competition will be considered closed, so I will not bother you anymore.
诸位，适才发放的仙缘石便是于在此处兑换天才地宝、丹方秘籍所用。若有剩余仙缘石，自可随时来此兑换，毋须担心。¤Gentlemen, the Immortal Fate Stones distributed just now are used to exchange for genius treasures and secret recipes here. If you have any remaining immortal edge stones, you can come here to exchange them at any time, don't worry.
原来，这里不过是天魔道无数据点中的一处。¤It turns out that this is just one of the countless strongholds of the Heavenly Demon Path.
此事事关魔门，还是去一趟白帝楼吧。¤This is a matter for the Devil's Gate, so it is better to go to the White Emperor's House.
想不到，竟连我派都被魔门渗透了…¤I can't believe that even our sect has been infiltrated by the Demon Sect...
你走进那个布有阵法的房间，原本阵法中心的那名散修，已经没了气息。¤You walk into the room with the formation, and the independent cultivator who was at the centre of the formation has lost his breath.
当年天魔道看中了枯木长老对于长生的迷恋，并且对枯木功也颇感兴趣，便拿出天魔道独门炼制添补寿元的丹药作为交换，得到了枯木长老的庇护与那本枯木功。¤Back then, when the Heavenly Demon Dao saw Elder Deadwood's fascination with longevity and his interest in the Deadwood Gong, they took out the Heavenly Demon Dao's unique refining pills to replenish longevity in exchange for the shelter of Elder Deadwood and the Deadwood Gong.
但也正因为那次，天魔道收敛过一段时间。最近几年风头过去才又开始活动。¤But it was because of that time that the Heavenly Demon Path was restrained for a while. It is only in the last few years that it has become active again.
面对此情此景，你摇头哀叹。¤In the face of this, you shake your head and lament.
不一会功夫，你便搜罗出一些玉简。零零星星地拼凑下，这里的情况倒也了解了个七七八八。¤In no time at all, you have searched out some jade slips. With a bit of patchwork, you have a good idea of what is going on here.
此前为了追枯木老祖，没来得及彻查此地，希望能找到些有用的线索...¤In order to chase the Deadwood Ancestor, I didn't have time to investigate this place thoroughly, so I hope I can find some useful clues...
你又将大大小小的房间找了个遍，活人的踪迹没找到，倒是发现了一堆白骨。¤You have searched the large and small rooms again and found no trace of a living person, but rather a pile of white bones.
唉…此等家丑还是莫要外传为好。¤Alas...it is better not to spread such family shame.
此等是非之地，不宜久留。还是先离开此地再做打算罢。¤This is not the right place to stay for long. It is better to leave here before making any plans.
多年前，竹山宗掌门曾下令彻查此事。不过有枯木长老的庇护，最后也没能查出东西，只得作罢。¤Many years ago, the head of the Bamboo Mountain Sect had ordered a thorough investigation into the matter. However, with the shelter of Elder Deadwood, he was unable to find out anything in the end and had to leave it at that.
想不到，竟连竹山宗这样的大势力都被魔门渗透了…¤I never imagined that even a major power like the Bamboo Mountain Sect had been infiltrated by the Demon Sect...
不瞒道友，前段时间在下冒着乱流季的风险出海猎杀妖兽，最后不仅灵舟被毁，还差点丢了性命。¤Don't be concealed, I took the risk of the turbulent season to hunt monsters at sea some time ago. In the end, not only the spirit boat was destroyed, but he almost lost his life.
若是当时找个安全的岛屿等上两个月，等灵气乱流平稳的月份再出海，也不至于落得这般下场。¤If you were to find a safe island and wait for two months, and then go out to sea in a month when the aura is turbulent and stable, you won't end up like this.
天魔道来宁州的目的，便是暗中抓捕宁州散修，行那活人炼丹之法。¤The purpose of the Heavenly Demon Dao's visit to Ning Province is to secretly capture Ning Province's independent Cultivators and perform the method of refining pills from living people.
嗯...这番推断倒也合理，不过仅凭目前的线索，却也无法断言此事一定与他们有关。¤Well... That's a reasonable deduction, but with the clues we have, we can't say that they are involved.
天魔道通过活人炼制的延寿丹药，与不少势力都有勾结。当年应该就是他们在各大门派安插了内鬼，挑拨与御剑门的关系。¤The Heavenly Devil Dao has colluded with many powers through the life extension pills made by living people. They should have been the ones who planted spies in the major sects back then to stir up relations with the Imperial Sword Sect.
另一个目的是...¤Another aim is to...
嗯...这么说确有一定道理，但总觉得还遗漏了一些什么...¤Well... There is some truth in that, but there is something missing...
嗯...这番推断倒也合理，至少仅凭目前的线索来看，这种可能性还是很大。¤Hmmm... That's a reasonable inference, at least based on the clues so far, and it's still very likely.
古神教通过控制倪府长老，查清了戮仙剑并不在白帝手中。此后又通过化尘教内鬼恒如的帮助，顺利在宁州古迹中夺取了戮仙剑。¤The Ancient God Sect found out that the Immortal Executing Sword was not in the hands of the White Emperor by controlling the Ni House elders. Thereafter, through the help of Heng Ru, a spy within the Dust Transformation Sect, he successfully seized the Immortal Executing Sword in the Ning Province monument.
血剑宫与白帝有宿怨，为此不惜兴师动众数次攻打白帝楼。¤The Blood Sword Palace has a long-standing grudge against the White Emperor, and for this reason it has gone to great lengths to attack the White Emperor's House several times.
师兄曾说过，你们在宁州古迹发现魔剑之前，已有魔修捷足先登了。既然魔剑最终被你收服，那魔门定然要另想办法。¤Senior brother once said that before you found the Devil's Sword at the Ning Province monument, there were already evil cultivators who had short-changed you. Since the demon sword was eventually collected by you, the demon sect must have thought of another way.
如今魔门蠢蠢欲动，各有所图。而当年之事，背后也定有魔门暗中推手...你可是有什么思绪了？¤Now the Devil's Gate is moving, each has its own agenda. And the incident back then, there must be the devil's clandestine hand behind it... Do you have any ideas?
天魔道修炼的功法恐怕离不开这些邪门的丹药，他们不惜冒险抓人炼丹，是因为他们需要长期潜伏在宁州。¤I'm afraid that the Heavenly Demon Dao cultivation techniques cannot be separated from these evil pills, and they don't hesitate to risk capturing people to refine pills because they need to lurk in Ning Province for a long time.
古神教屡次渗透离火门，正是为了调查火麒麟的情报。¤The Ancient God Sect has repeatedly infiltrated the Heavenly Fire Gate precisely to investigate the information of the Fire Qilin.
古神教通过魔神蛊控制化尘教的恒如长老，由此渗透化尘教长达数百年。¤The Ancient God Cult controlled the Heng Ru elders of the Dust Transformation Cult through the Devil God Compulsion, thus infiltrating the Dust Transformation Cult for hundreds of years.
我还是再想想吧...¤I'd better think about it again...
古神教通过魔神蛊控制了不少散修为己所用，目的正是为了发展自身在宁州的势力。¤The Ancient God Sect has controlled many independent cultivators for its own use through the Devil God Compulsion, precisely to develop its own power in Ning Province.
嗯...这番推断倒也合理。¤Hmmm... That's a reasonable inference.
天魔道{$tmdstr1}，而天魔道来宁州的主要目的，则是{$tmdstr2}...¤Heavenly Demon Path {$tmdstr1}，and the main reason Heavenly Demon Path came to Ning Province is {$tmdstr2}...
血剑宫在当年大战后不久便出现在宁州，甚至救下了重伤的凌轩。¤The Blood Sword Palace appeared in Ning Province shortly after the great battle that year, and even saved the seriously injured Ling Xuan.
除此以外，血剑宫来宁州的主要目的应该是...¤Apart from that, the main purpose of the Blood Sword Palace's visit to Ning Province should be...
除此以外，天魔道来宁州的主要目的应该是...¤Apart from that, the main purpose of the Heavenly Demon Path's visit to Ning Province should be...
目前收集到有关天魔道的线索中，其实包含着一个可能与御剑门有关的重要的信息。天魔道...¤The clues gathered so far about the Heavenly Demon Path actually contain an important piece of information that may be related to the Imperial Sword Sect. The Heavenly Demon Path...
天魔道应当与玄道宗有宿怨，因此才会不惜派遣多名元婴期修士攻打玄道宗。¤The Heavenly Demon Dao should have a long-standing grudge against the Mystic Dao Sect, which is why it went out of its way to send a number of YuanYing stage cultivators to attack the Mystic Dao Sect.
不管怎么说，至少我们可以有所防备...等下次见到凌轩师兄的时候，再问问他的看法吧。¤In any case, at least we can be prepared... Let's ask Brother Ling Xuan what he thinks when we next see him.
而当年最先流传出御剑门私通魔门传闻的是...¤The first rumours of the Royal Sword Sect's fornication with the Demon Sect were circulated back then...
根据之前打听到的线索，当年是一名离火门弟子最先传出了御剑门私通魔门的消息。¤According to the clues I had inquired about earlier, it was a disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate who first spread the news of the Imperial Sword Sect's involvement with the Demon Sect back then.
目前收集到有关古神教的线索中，其实包含着一个可能与御剑门有关的重要的信息。古神教...¤The clues collected so far about the Ancient God Cult actually contain an important piece of information that may be related to the Imperial Sword Sect. The Ancient God Cult...
天魔道不仅与宁王府有勾结，与竹山宗长老亦有勾结。¤Not only does the Heavenly Demon Dao have collusion with the Ning Dynasty, it also has collusion with the elders of the Bamboo Mountain Sect.
古神教通过魔神蛊渗了宁州各大势力，以获取情报和利益，发展自身在宁州的势力。¤The Ancient God Sect has infiltrated the major forces in Ning Province through the Demon God Compulsion in order to obtain information and benefits and develop its own power in Ning Province.
天魔道来宁州的主要目的，是为了调查天魔眼的情报，并找机会释放天魔眼中的天魔。¤The main purpose of the Heavenly Demon Dao's visit to Ning Province is to investigate information about the Heavenly Demon Eye and to find opportunities to release the Heavenly Demon in the Eye.
天魔道来宁州的主要目的，也是为了夺取戮仙剑。¤The main purpose of the Heavenly Demon Dao's visit to Ning Province was also to seize the Immortal Executing Sword.
可老夫并不记得曾与什么魔门结过仇...而且若要说寻仇的话，玄道宗与其它五大门派才应该是首当其冲才对...¤But I don't remember having any enmity with any demon sect... And if we're talking about seeking revenge, the Mystic Dao Sect and the other five sects should be the first to suffer...
古神教曾通过魔神蛊控制倪府长老，试图以此达到渗透白帝楼的目的。¤The Ancient God Sect had controlled the Ni House elders through the Demon God Compulsion in an attempt to infiltrate the White Emperor House.
血剑宫兴师动众来宁州攻打白帝楼，便是为了夺取戮仙剑。¤The Blood Sword Palace has come to Ning Province to attack the White Emperor's House in order to seize the Immortal Executing Sword.
千年来活跃于宁州之魔道无外乎天魔道，古神教与血剑宫三者，先按现在已经收集到的线索逐一推断试试吧...¤The three demons that have been active in Ning Province for a thousand years are the Heavenly Demon Path, the Ancient Gods and the Blood Sword Palace.
血剑宫救下凌轩是为了弄清楚御剑门之战时发生了什么，看来他们并没有直接经历这次战斗。¤The Blood Sword Palace saved Ling Xuan in order to find out what happened during the battle of the Imperial Sword Gate, and it seems that they did not directly experience this battle.
血剑宫{$xjgstr1}，而血剑宫来宁州的主要目的，则是{$xjgstr2}...¤The Blood Sword Palace {$xjgstr1}, and the main purpose of the Blood Sword Palace coming to Ning Province is {$xjgstr2}...
天魔道来宁州的主要目的，是为了伺机报复玄道宗。¤The main purpose of the Heavenly Demon Dao's visit to Ning Province is to wait for an opportunity to take revenge on the Mystic Dao Sect.
古神教为了调查火麒麟的情报，常年通过魔神蛊渗透离火门。若他们想通过在离火门内安插的内鬼散布御剑门私通魔门的谣言，想必不是难事。¤In order to investigate the information of the Fire Qilin, the Ancient God Sect has been infiltrating the Heavenly Fire Gate through the Demon God Compulsion all year round. If they wanted to spread rumours of the Imperial Sword Sect's fornication with the Demon Sect through the mole planted within the Heavenly Fire Gate, I'm sure it wouldn't be difficult.
血剑宫来宁州的目的，正是为了攻打白帝楼，向白帝寻仇。¤The purpose of the Blood Sword Palace's visit to Ning Province was precisely to attack the White Emperor's House and seek revenge on the White Emperor.
血剑宫一直以来的目标都是收集魔剑，当年事发之时也曾出现在宁州。当年最有可能对御剑门下手的应该就是他们。¤The Blood Sword Palace has always aimed to collect demonic swords and was also present in Ning Province when the incident occurred back then. They would have been the ones most likely to strike at the Royal Sword Sect back then.
由此看来，当年的幕后黑手最有可能是....¤So it seems most likely that the person behind it back then was ....
目前收集到有关血剑宫的线索中，其实包含着一个可能与御剑门有关的重要的信息。血剑宫...¤The clues collected so far about the Blood Sword Palace actually contain an important piece of information that may be related to the Imperial Sword Sect. The Blood Sword Palace...
唔...老夫记得似乎不是这样...¤Well... I don't remember that being the case...
从千年前起，古神教就不断尝试通过魔神蛊控制离火门的弟子。¤Since a thousand years ago, the Ancient God Sect has constantly tried to control the disciples of the Heavenly Fire Gate through the Demon God Compulsion.
血剑宫对白帝所创的剑术功法觊觎已久，他们暗中调查与攻打白帝楼，实际是为了盗取白帝楼功法。¤The Blood Sword Palace has long coveted the sword art technique created by the White Emperor, and their secret investigation and attack on the White Emperor's House is actually to steal the White Emperor's House technique.
古神教{$gsjstr1}，而古神教来宁州的目的有两个，分别是{$gsjstr2}和{$gsjstr3}...¤The Ancient Gods {$gsjstr1}, and the Ancient Gods came to Ning Province for two purposes, {$gsjstr2} and {$gsjstr3}...
白帝楼？当年哪儿来的白帝楼？¤The White Emperor's House? Where did the White Emperor's House come from back in the day?
仔细想想，当年魔门盯上御剑门，真正的目的是为了...¤When you think about it, the real purpose of the Demon Sect's targeting of the Imperial Sword Sect back then was to...
除此以外，古神教来宁州的目的应该有两个。其一是...¤Apart from that, there should be two purposes for the Ancient God Cult to come to Ning Province. One of them is...
《衍复笔录》......？¤Yanfu Transcript......?
你将笔录收进储物袋，打算离开宁州古迹后再交换给金虹剑派。¤You put the transcript in your storage bag and plan to exchange it with the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect after you leave the Ning Province Historic Site.
此人实力不俗，从神通看来应当与金虹剑派有着不小的渊源......¤This person is quite strong. From the perspective of his supernatural powers, he should have a lot of connections with the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect...
你将笔录收进储物袋，打算离开宁州古迹后再做打算。¤You put the transcripts into your storage bag, and plan to leave the Ning Province monuments before making plans.
你草草地翻了几页，里面大致记载了一些此人对于剑道的所得以及些许的生活琐事。¤You have flipped through a few pages, and it roughly records some of this person's gains from kendo and some trivial things in life.
看来这就是金虹剑派所寻的大长老吧...这煞气真是可怕，竟连此等强者也难逃心智损毁的厄运......¤The evil spirit is so terrible, even such a strong person can hardly escape the bad luck of mental damage...
不错的灵力，这条泽蟒绝非普通的筑基期妖兽实力，小心应对。¤Not bad spiritual power, this Zemang is definitely not an ordinary base-building monster strength, so be careful.
哎哟，伤口裂开了，好疼啊，还是{$Lin}去开凿那万载冰心石矿吧。¤Ouch, the wound is open, it hurts so much, let's {$Lin} go and dig the 10,000-year-old Bingxin Quarry.
都放你那吧，我们赶紧回林府给你疗伤。¤I'll leave you alone, we'll go back to the Lin Mansion to heal you.
孽畜！你敢！¤Evil beast! How dare you!
好，好好，是我记错了，{$Lin}一直很会关心人。¤Well, well, I was wrong, {$Lin} has always cared about people.
少来了，冥蛛可是神识攻击，哪有什么伤口。¤Come on, the ghost spider is an attack of divine consciousness, so there is no wound.
眼看林沐心又要上来揍你，赶紧用法宝将整块万载冰心石矿脉尽数取下，随机收入储物袋中。¤Seeing that Lin Muxin was about to come up to beat you again, she quickly took down the entire Ten Thousand Years Bingxin Stone vein with a magic weapon and put it in a storage bag at random.
嗯...你的伤怎么样...¤hmm... how is your injury...
全都给我倒成你陪我来这洞窟探索了。¤It's all for me, but you accompany me to explore this cave.
林沐心再躲过冥蛛蓄力的一招后，趁着这妖兽下一轮攻击未至，闪身到你近旁。¤Lin MuXin dodged the spider's stored energy move, while the Spirit Beast's next round of attacks have not arrived, dodged to your side.
眼见你将要抵挡不住那冥蛛的神识攻击时，林沐心竟在遁术的加持下一闪身便挡在你身前。¤I saw that you will not be able to resist the attack of the soul sense of the spider, Lin MuXin actually in the transport of a body in front of you with the support of a flash.
喏，把这五阶妖丹收好，其他还要什么吗？¤Well, put away these fifth-order demon pills, what else do you want?
好在林沐心是有备而来，并未因此受伤，反倒是与冥蛛打的有来有回。让你悬着的心放下不少。¤The good thing is that Lin MuXin came prepared and did not get hurt, but instead fought with the spider back and forth. Let your hanging heart down a lot.
哪，哪有，我一向都很关心人的。¤No, no, I have always cared about people.
我...¤I...
这东西除了偷袭有一手，倒也没多强，就是不知道它从哪儿来的，竟能躲过我们俩的神识探测。¤This thing is not that strong except for sneak attacks, but I don't know where it came from, and it can escape the detection of the two of us.
（终于是让{$Lin}放心了，不过这冥蛛的神识攻击还真是强力，看来之后不免要修养几天了。）¤(Finally, {$Lin} was relieved, but the spirit attack of this ghost spider is really powerful, and it seems that it will take a few days to cultivate.)
但数十回合之后，这神通你来我往之下，林沐心却未占得半点好处，反倒是因为担心你的伤势而越战越急，好几次露出破绽，险些中招。¤But after dozens of rounds, this soul sense you and I under, Lin MuXin but did not take advantage of half, but because of the fear of your injury and more and more anxious, several times reveal a breach, almost hit.
嘿嘿，没想到居然骗不到你。¤Hey, I didn't expect that I couldn't deceive you.
放心吧，我这不还能在你的帮助下击杀这冥蛛呢。¤Don't worry, I can't kill this ghost spider with your help.
你小心翼翼地将那万载冰心石矿脉尽数凿下，但仍是不见那冥蛛的身影，你也只得小心翼翼地抱起因神识受损而有些意识昏沉的林沐心往洞外退去。¤You carefully cut down all the veins of the ten thousand years of ice heart stone, but you still can't see the figure of the ghost spider. You also have to carefully pick up Lin Muxin, who has lost consciousness due to the damage of her consciousness, and retreat out of the cave.
咦？以前的{$Lin}可不是这样的，若是换成当年，哪怕是越阶战斗之后，你都不会担心我哈哈。¤Huh? The previous {$Lin} was not like this. If it were changed to that year, you wouldn't worry about me even after the battle.
{FirstName}{$NickName}刚才受了些伤，这冥蛛又难缠得很，我们还是离开此处吧。¤{The first thing I want to do is to get out of here.
少贫嘴了，既然没事就快去把你的万载冰心石凿下来吧。¤Don't be so rude, and since it's all right, go and chisel down your Wanzai Bingxin Stone.
你虽为她担心，当刚才的战斗已是耗费了大量的灵气与精力，一时间也难以做些什么。¤Although you are worried about her, when the battle just now has been a lot of aura and energy consumption, a time is difficult to do something.
哼，不要了，都给你吧。¤Hmph, no, I'll give it to you.
这冥蛛眼看自己不是你的对手，全力抵挡你两记神通后，看准攻击空隙躲至那万载冰心石矿脉旁，不知以何方法隐去了自身的身形，乃至神识气息也消弭无踪。¤Seeing that he is not your opponent, this ghost spider has fully resisted your two supernatural powers, and after seeing the attack gap, he hides beside the ten thousand years of ice core stone veins. No trace.
你驱动法宝细致的将整块万载冰心石矿脉尽数取下，随即收入储物袋中。¤You drive the magic weapon to carefully remove all the ore veins of the ten thousand years of ice core stone, and then put it in the storage bag.
这一拳看起来下手狠厉，落实处却是很轻。¤This punch looks hard, but it is very light.
老掉牙的把戏还想骗我第二次呢。¤The old trick is trying to fool me a second time.
不等涨红着脸的林沐心回话，你快速将话题转回到冥蛛上。¤Before waiting for the blushing Lin Muxin to reply, you quickly turned the topic back to the ghost spider.
感动，林家二小姐终于有些长进了。¤Touched, the second Miss Lin family finally made some progress.
这冥蛛是元婴期妖兽，身上可都是好东西，我们分一分吧。¤This ghost spider is a monster in the Nascent Soul stage, and it is full of good things. Let's share it.
好了，回去吧。¤Okay, let's go back.
林沐心一脸关切的走上来，却是狠狠的给了你一拳。¤Lin Muxin walked up with a concerned look, but gave you a hard punch.
糟了...恐怕龙族误以为再次上当，特意前来讨个说法......！¤Crap... I'm afraid the dragons mistakenly thought that they were fooled again, and came here to ask for an explanation...!
即便百里族多年根基毁于一旦，你也要一意孤行吗？¤Even if the foundation of the Baili tribe is destroyed for many years, do you have to go your own way?
呵呵，你们这是打算去哪啊？¤Hehe, where do you plan to go?
你们对视几秒，百里奇悄悄地指向门外，你心领神会，打算同他一起悄无声息地溜出府去。¤You look at each other for a few seconds, and Bailiqi quietly points out the door. You understand it and plan to sneak out of the house quietly with him.
可这本来就并非我族之物，如今物归原主本为理所应当之事！¤But this was originally not a thing of our clan, now it is a matter of course for the thing to return to the original owner!
父亲言下之意是要我像祖父一样，为了自己的前程做个背信弃义之人吗！¤What my father meant was that I, like my grandfather, wanted me to be a perfidious person for my own future!
父亲此话何意？难不成我百里家失了这龙珠就一事无成！¤What's the meaning of father's words? Is it possible that my Baili family will do nothing without this dragon ball!
父亲！您怎么会在这里！¤Father! Why are you here!
你们刚推开门，便被站在庭中的百里邑捉了个正着。¤As soon as you opened the door, you were caught by Bailiyi standing in the courtyard.
言罢，百里邑略带责备地望向百里奇，失望地叹了口气，转身向院外走去。¤After that, Bailiyi looked at Bailiqi with a slight reproach, sighed in disappointment, and turned and walked outside the courtyard.
你是百里一族的少主，肩负着我族的未来。难道你真要将龙珠带走，弃族人于不顾吗？¤You are the young master of the Baili clan, shouldering the future of my clan. Do you really want to take the Dragon Ball away and leave it alone?
不好了家主！海上！海上来了好大一群龙！码头那里看得清清楚楚！¤Bad Patriarch! At sea! A large group of dragons have come from the sea! You can see clearly from the dock!
什么？！龙族明明答应不再入侵广陵城...快带我去看看！¤What?! The Dragon Clan has promised not to invade Guangling City again...Take me to see!
我们也去码头看看吧！¤Let's go to the pier and have a look!
胡闹！你祖父为了族人费心竭力，又岂是你能议论的？¤Naughty! Your grandfather tried so hard for the people, how can you talk about it?
为何龙族会突然来到广陵城...？难道说...{FirstName}{xiongdi}，五年之期已过？¤Why did the dragons suddenly come to Guangling City...? Could it be that...{FirstName}{xiongdi}, the five-year period has passed?
我先前在府中等候百里兄便花了许久的时间，而后寻找百里兄时破解阵法也耗费了多时，恐怕已经过了与龙湛约定的日子。¤I used to wait for Brother Baili in the mansion for a long time, and then it took a long time to crack the formation when looking for Brother Baili. I am afraid that the day agreed with Long Zhan has passed.
也就是现在的，血薇仙子。¤Also known as the current, Blood Violet Immortal.
好好好！¤Well, well, well!
他虽然没传授太多的功法神通给我，但也算是我师父吧。¤Although he did not teach me too many techniques and abilities, but it is also considered my master, right?
但还有另一分支，筑基期的祭血侍和金丹期的祭血使。¤But there is another branch, the Foundation Establishment Blood Ritual Servants and the Golden Dan Stage Blood Ritual Ambassadors.
是数道残留有魔气的剑痕。我推测是在不久前曾有人在此尝试收服过这柄魔剑，只是不知为何退走了。¤It is several sword marks with the demonic energy remaining. I presume that someone had attempted to subdue this demonic sword here not long ago, only to retreat for some unknown reason.
嗯，不过动身之前还有一事。¤Well, but there is one more thing before we leave.
随着一声轻喝，白帝右手后引，顶着诛仙剑强大的吞噬之力从剑中强行扯出一个半透明的身影。¤With a light drink, the white emperor's right hand back lead, topped by the powerful devouring force of the immortal sword from the sword forcibly pulled out a translucent figure.
这信物你且收下，若在玄道宗遇到麻烦，只需出示即可。¤Take this token, and if you encounter trouble in the Mystic Dao Sect, you can simply present it.
白帝一边说着，竟有些激动了起来，陡然升起的气势让你和倪旭欣都不由得退后数步才堪堪站稳，更不容说房里本就不多的装饰，如今都是一片狼藉。而且你们知道，这还是白帝在努力克制着自己，不然...¤As the White Emperor spoke, he actually became somewhat agitated, and the aura that rose so steeply that both you and Ni XuXin could not help but retreat several steps before they could stand still, not to mention that the room, which was already not much decorated, was now a mess. And you know, this is still the White Emperor is trying to restrain himself, otherwise...
好，我会尽快启程前往宁州。¤Good, I will depart for Ning Province as soon as possible.
（难道魏老的推测不对？嗯，修炼至今没见过有其他人会御剑门功法，不如用魏老教的《长生诀》口诀再试探一番。）¤（Could it be that Elder Wei's speculation is not correct? Well, I haven't seen anyone else know the Imperial Sword Sect technique so far, so I might as well use the chant for 'Longevity Art' taught by Elder Wei to test it out again.）
我怎么感觉自己与师祖还有{FirstName}{xiongdi}不在同一个世界...完全不知道发生了什么...¤How do I feel that I am not in the same world as my master and {FirstName}{xiongdi}... Totally do not know what is happening...
啊，对了，{FirstName}{xiongdi}你之前不是说有事找师祖么，可别忘了。¤Ah, yes, {FirstName}{xiongdi} you did not say before that there is something to find the master, do not forget.
只是一缕虚弱的剑魂居然能让这位无敌于天下的白帝声泪俱下，哭得像是一个于红尘中难以自拔的凡人！¤Just a wisp of soul can actually make the invincible White Emperor cry like a common mortal and unable to remove himself from his feelings!
但从宁州古迹回来后，我除了修炼便是在宗门大殿中主持门派事务，未曾听说有此事。¤But after returning from the Ning Province monuments, I have not heard of this matter since I returned from my training or presiding over the sect's affairs in the sect's main hall.
老头曾说过，这柄剑是他在宁州古迹中找到的。当年在古迹中还发生过什么值得注意的事么？¤The old man had said that he had found the sword in a Ning Province monument. Did anything else of note happen in the monument back then?
这可是化神后期修士白帝！这可是宁州乃至九州第一剑修白帝！这可是能护宁州安定的白帝楼楼主白帝！¤This is a late stage Deity Transformation cultivator, the White Emperor! This is the number one sword cultivator in Ning Province and even Kyushu, the White Emperor! This is the white emperor who can protect the stability of Ning Province, the owner of the white emperor building white emperor!
但你也没能察觉到，在窥探白帝语气变化的同时，你自己眉间的阴霾也是静静地散开。¤But you also failed to notice that while spying the change in the tone of the White Emperor, the gloom between your own brows is quietly dispersed.
{FirstName}{$shidi}，私下里不用客气，叫我一声师兄即可。但在外还请莫要告及他人我的真实身份，如今魔门蠢动，此事恐引起分歧，不利于宁州众派团结对外。¤{FirstName}{$shidi}, you don't have to be polite in private, just call me Brother. But please don't tell others about my true identity outside. Now that the Demon Sect is on the move, this matter may cause disagreement, which is not conducive to the unity of the Ning Province sects.
是的。在白帝楼建立前，他们甚至更少在宁州露面，所以我当时对血剑宫了解不深。乃至错认为他们只是个追求剑道的门派，只是神通较为狠厉而已。¤Yes. Before the establishment of the White Emperor House, they even more rarely showed up in Ning Province, so I didn't know much about the Blood Sword Palace at that time. I even mistakenly thought that they were just a sect pursuing the sword dao, only with more ruthless divine abilities.
他们不仅掌控一柄魔剑，又努力渗透天魔眼禁制多年，恐怕是会率先发难。¤Not only do they control a demonic sword and have worked hard to penetrate the Heavenly Demon Eye ban for years, I'm afraid they will be the first to strike.
所以它在师父与古树战斗后才变成现在这样的？¤So it became like this after Master fought with the ancient tree?
天长地久，大地之所以能长久者，以其不自生...¤The reason why the earth lasts is that it is not self-generating...
为了防止意外发生，我便独自顺着痕迹追寻而去，果然发现有一人正敛息潜伏于附近。此人见形迹暴露，扔出几枚血煞符将我逼退后，便用某种遁术逃离了。¤In order to prevent accidents, I followed the trail alone and found a person lurking nearby. This person saw the traces exposed, threw out a few bloodshed talismans to force me back, and then used some kind of evasion technique to escape.
即便离白帝初学这段口诀已是过去了近两千年之久，但这位化神期大能还是如当年稚嫩的年轻修士般，顺畅地念出了后续的口诀。¤Even though nearly two thousand years had passed since the White Emperor first learned this recitation, the Deity Transformation Stage great power still recited the subsequent recitation as smoothly as a young cultivator back then.
白帝没有继续说下去，但你显然已经知道他未说出口的是什么。¤The White Emperor did not continue, but you obviously already know what he left unsaid.
那缕身影似乎是过于虚弱，总给人一种快要消散在世间的感觉。白帝也是强行按下心中的惊诧，将之重新送回锈剑中，并留下几缕剑意作为保护。¤The wisp of a figure seems to be too weak, always giving a feeling of about to dissipate in the world. The White Emperor also forced down the astonishment in his heart, sent it back into the rusty sword, and left a few wisps of sword intent as protection.
你没有选择回答白帝的问题，而是将刚转化为纯阳法宝的锈剑取下，并递给白帝。后者也只是激动了片刻，在你递上锈剑时已然恢复了平时淡然自若的神态。¤You did not choose to answer the White Emperor's question, but removed the rusty sword that had just been transformed into a pure Yang magic treasure and handed it to the White Emperor. The latter was only excited for a moment, and had returned to his usual breezy demeanor when you handed over the rusty sword.
那就交给{FirstName}{$shidi}了。¤Then it's over to {FirstName}{$shidi}.
当年离火门领着五大宗门围困我御剑门时，原本只需师傅亲自出面沟通，或可解此危局。但正是由于师傅未能收服魔剑，以至于大量魔气从我派护宗大阵中溢出，才导致...¤When the Five Great Sects led by the Heavenly Fire Gate besieged our Royal Sword Sect, it was originally only necessary for Master to personally communicate with them, which might have solved the critical situation. However, it was because Master failed to subdue the demonic sword that a large amount of demonic energy spilled out of our sect's protective formation, which led to...
白帝左手持剑，右手虚抓，灵气喷涌而出，却是被锈剑全数吞噬，连原本黯淡的剑柄也是有光泽了起来，剑身更是剑气吞吐，一副蓄势待发的样子。¤The White Emperor held the sword in his left hand, his right hand grasped in vain, the spiritual qi spurted out, but was swallowed up by the rusty sword in its entirety, even the originally dull hilt was also shiny, the sword body was even Sword Qi gulping, a look of ready momentum.
（白帝竟然没有认出诛仙剑？它之前可是吸收了不少魔气和煞气，虽是没有恢复全盛状态，也已是纯阳灵宝了。）¤（The White Emperor did not recognize the Immortal Punishing Sword? It previously absorbed a lot of demonic and fatal energy, although it did not return to its full strength, but also has been a pure Yang spiritual treasure.）
白帝前辈可知那古树的来历？¤Does senior White Emperor know the origin of the ancient tree?
据我所知，血剑宫的修士似乎并不经常出现在宁州。¤As far as I know, cultivators from the Blood Sword Palace don't seem to appear in Ning Province very often.
这老头真是不安生，死了一千多年了居然还给我找了个小{$shidi}，哈哈哈。¤This old man is really restless, dead for more than a thousand years actually gave me a small {$shidi}, hahaha.
这是血剑宫特有的分级制度，一般来说从练气到化神分别是血剑傀，血剑侍，血剑使，血剑尊与血剑仙。¤This is the unique grading system of the Blood Sword Palace. Generally speaking, from Qi Training to Deity Transformation, there are Blood Sword Puppets, Blood Sword Servants, Blood Sword Ambassadors, Blood Sword Exalts and Blood Sword Immortals.
前辈谬赞了，倪兄可是继承了前辈的衣钵传承，此次能从海底生还，还是托前辈的福。¤Seniors fallacious praise, Ni brother but inherited the mantle heritage of seniors, this time to survive from the bottom of the sea, or thanks to the blessing of seniors.
至于天魔眼一事，{FirstName}{$shidi}若是遇到了麻烦也可以找白帝楼中人或是振东与阿欣帮忙。¤As for the matter of the Heavenly Demon Eye, {FirstName}{$shidi} if you encounter trouble you can also find people in the White Emperor Pavillion or Zhen Dong and Xin to help.
（师祖居然...哭...哭了？）¤（The ancestor actually... Crying... Crying?
（就倪兄那炼丹技术，数百年都没啥长进，估计白帝想说的可能是‘老朽怎会拿天道果给你小子暴殄天物’，哈哈哈。）¤（Ni brother that alchemy technology, hundreds of years have not much progress, I think the white emperor may want to say 'how will the old rotten take the heavenly dao fruit to you kid waste heavenly goods', ha ha ha.）
凌轩...¤Ling Xuan...
当年在为师傅护法之时，我确实留意到了一些令人在意的痕迹。¤That time, when I was guarding Master, I did notice something wasn't quite right.
这小子从小就喜欢冒险，以前想着有振东给他的法宝保命，也就由着他去了。没想他小子竟然敢带着小友莽莽撞撞地奔着图南海就去了，若不是小友实力强劲，不但阿欣要夭于海底，还得搭上小友。¤This kid likes to take risks since he was a child, and he used to think that he had the magic treasure given to him by Zhendong to protect his life, so he let him go. I didn't think he would dare to take you to the South China Sea recklessly, if not for your strong strength, not only Ah Xin to die at the bottom of the sea, but also to take you.
嗯，老朽初至那古树附近时，仅是瞥了一眼，却是被灌输了大量的大道感悟，险些神魂失守。而后又知道了这古树的果实竟是传说中的天道果，更是让老朽确信了这一点。¤Well, when the old man first arrived near the ancient tree, just a glance, but was imbued with a large number of great enlightenment, almost lost the soul. The fact that the fruit of the tree was the legendary Heavenly Dao fruit convinced me of this.
晚辈{FirstName}{LastName}，见过白帝前辈。¤The late generation {FirstName}{LastName}, meet senior White Emperor.
嘿嘿，那师祖你老人家就没顺手给我拿个几颗天道果炼丹么？¤Hey, that master ancestor you old man did not by the way to me to take a few heavenly path fruit alchemy?
这铁剑看上去平淡无奇，却是纯阳法宝，其中的吞噬威能也是令人惊奇。但又与《长生诀》有何联系？等等，其中有几分熟悉的气息。¤This iron sword looks bland, but it is a pure Yang magic treasure, and the devouring might in it is astonishing. But what is its connection with Longevity Art? Wait, something within it feels familiar.
后来我与血薇接连突破至元婴境界，也与荣升血剑尊的她一同参与宫内事务，因此看到了血剑宫修士为了力量无所不用其极的本性。¤Later on, Blood Wei and I broke through to the Yuan Ying realm one after another, and we also participated in the affairs of the palace together with her, who had been promoted to the rank of Blood Sword Master, so we saw the nature of Blood Sword Palace cultivators who would do anything for power.
白帝尽量让自己的声音保持平静，但你明显能从中察觉出那种像是受限于瓶颈千年，终是突破桎梏的惊喜之情。¤The white emperor tried to keep his voice Balanced, but you can obviously detect the kind of surprise like a bottleneck limited to a thousand years, finally break through the shackles of the feelings.
千年前好像是听说过这号人，不过这么多年过去，也没太多印象了。¤I think I heard of this person a thousand years ago, but after all these years, I don't remember much.
嗯...老朽其实也不太清楚，若不是前往图南海调查魔剑，也是不知海底还有这神奇的古树。不，与其说是古树，不如把他看成道的化身。¤Well... If I hadn't gone to the South China Sea to investigate the Devil's Sword, I wouldn't have known that there was this magical tree at the bottom of the sea. No, rather than an ancient tree, we should see him as the incarnation of the Tao.
好，请凌师兄放心。¤Good, please don't worry, Senior Brother Ling.
{FirstName}{$shidi}，让你见笑了。咳，若是有什么想问的，我可以为你解惑。¤{FirstName}{$shidi}, let you laugh. I'm not sure if you want to ask anything, but I can help you out.
确定了魔剑曾出现在九嶷山后，这行人中唯一的元婴修士便要求其他金丹修士分散出去调查诛仙剑的下落。而我则被其中一位女性修士自告奋勇地带回了血剑宫。¤Having established that the magic sword had appeared in Jiuyi Mountain, the only YuanYing cultivator among the group asked the other Jindan cultivators to scatter out to investigate the whereabouts of the Immortal Execution Sword. I, on the other hand, was taken back to the Blood Sword Palace by one of the female cultivators who volunteered to do so.
我会去寻找残魂复活秘术的线索，此行可能要远赴其他州乃至是无尽之海深处，传音符大概会失去效用。若有收获，会以秘法通知振东，届时让阿欣联系你。¤I will go in search of clues to the secret technique of resurrection of the remnant soul. I may have to travel far to other states or even the depths of the Endless Sea on this trip, and the sound transmission talisman will probably be useless. If I find anything, I will use a secret technique to inform Zhendong and have Ah Xin contact you then.
师父的魂体非常虚弱，但也没什么大碍，在剑中静养慢慢恢复即可。¤Master's soul body is very weak, but nothing serious, in the sword to recuperate slowly to recover.
另外...当年御剑门绝未私通魔门，只是多年来我一直未能找寻出被埋藏的真相。{shidi}若是有机会，务必留意相关线索。¤Besides... The Royal Sword Sect in no way fornicated with the Demon Sect back then, it's just that I haven't been able to find the buried truth over the years. {If you have the chance, do keep an eye out for clues.
似乎是离火门当时的筑基期大弟子在九嶷山遇上了魔修，后来与我派弟子交流情报时又起了纠纷，被当场击杀。¤It seems that the then great Foundation Establishment disciple of the Heavenly Fire Gate encountered a evil cultivator on Jiuyi Mountain and was later killed on the spot after a dispute with a disciple of our sect when exchanging information.
这次海底之行多亏{FirstName}小友给阿欣这孩子帮忙了。¤This trip to the bottom of the sea thanks to {FirstName} little friend to Ah Xin this child help.
在倪旭欣自言自语地上演一小出插曲时，白帝也是快速的调整好了自己的心情。¤When Ni XuXin staged a small interlude muttering to himself, the White Emperor was also quick to adjust his mood.
小友不必谦虚，阿欣的实力老朽还是清楚的，若是他独自面对那古树，哪怕只是外围的根须，也只会是束手无策。¤There is no need to be modest, Ah Xin's strength is still clear to the old man, if he were to face that ancient tree alone, even if it is only the peripheral roots, he would only be helpless.
白帝一边说着，竟有些激动了起来，陡然升起的气势让你皱了皱眉，倪旭欣则是连退数步才堪堪站稳，更不容说房里本就不多的装饰，如今都是一片狼藉。而且你们知道，这还是白帝在努力克制着自己，不然...¤As the White Emperor spoke, he actually became somewhat agitated, and the steep rise of his aura made you frown, while Ni XuXin took several steps back before he could stand still, not to mention that the room, which was already not much decorated, was now all in disarray. And you know, this is still the White Emperor is trying to restrain himself, otherwise...
那古树既能孕育天道果，又岂是这么好对付的。老朽跟它过了两招确定与魔剑无关，也就离去了。¤The ancient tree can nurture the fruit of the heavenly dao, and is not so easy to deal with. The old man had two moves with it to make sure it had nothing to do with the magic sword, and left.
也许我应该退出去，让他们慢慢聊？¤Perhaps I should withdraw and let them take their time to chat?
出！¤Out!
不知白帝前辈可曾听过凌轩这个名字？¤I do not know if the white emperor senior has heard of the name Ling Xuan?
说起来，这算不算是我知道了师祖的秘密，以后可以威胁他帮我找各种丹药了嘿嘿。¤Speaking of which, does this count as me knowing my master ancestor's secret and being able to threaten him to help me find all kinds of Pills in the future hehehe.
这一类则是天赋不足，无法在寿元无多之前将自身修为修炼至当前境界的大圆满，遂靠药物强行提升，以寻求渺茫的突破机会。¤This is the category of those who are not gifted enough to reach the fullness of their current level before their life expectancy is too short, and who rely on drugs to force their way up in search of a slim chance of a breakthrough.
白帝前辈，请看此剑。¤Senior White Emperor, please see this sword.
血剑宫么...御剑门事件中我曾一度重伤昏迷。而在我醒转后，身前站着的便是血剑宫的一众修士。¤The Blood Sword Palace... I was seriously injured and unconscious at one point during the Royal Sword Gate incident. And after I woke up, it was a group of cultivators from the Blood Sword Palace that stood in front of me.
不对，师祖说{FirstName}{xiongdi}是他{$shidi}是什么意思，那他岂不是成了我的师叔祖？¤No, what does it mean when the master says {FirstName}{xiongdi} is his {$shidi}, then wouldn't he become my senior uncle?
他们自称用丹药暂缓了我的伤势，又询问了一些御剑门的相关问题。¤They claimed to have used a potion to temporarily slow down my injuries and asked some more questions about the Imperial Sword Sect.
还好我千年来谨遵您老的教诲，不忘道心，不受利诱，如今也是宁州正道一方巨擘，没有丢了您的脸，哈！哈...哈...¤Fortunately, I have been following your teachings for a thousand years, not forgetting the dao, not being tempted by profit, and now I am a giant in the Ning Province righteous path, so I have not disgraced you, ha! Ha... Ha...
于是也没想太多，在血薇的照料下好起来后甚至一同参习剑道，交流心得。¤So they didn't think too much of it, and when they got better under Bloodwort's care they even studied the sword together and exchanged ideas.
嗯？这难道是剑魂？我怎么没见过有剑魂的纯阳灵宝，{FirstName}{xiongdi}的这把剑真特别。¤Hmm? Could this be a sword soul? How come I've never seen a pure Yang spiritual treasure with a sword soul, {FirstName}{xiongdi} this sword is really special.
此乃我独门化神秘术，名唤《定元咒》，料想师父已是将御剑门神通尽数传授，我也只有以此作为见面礼赠与{FirstName}{$shidi}了。¤This is my unique mystical art, called the 《fixed element incantation》, I think the master has already passed on all the magic of the Imperial Sword Sect, I can only give this as a gift to {FirstName}{$shidi}.
这...这是《长生诀》的口诀！¤This is... This is the chant for《Longevity Art》!
这被誉为九州第一剑仙的老人，竟是双目濡湿，那双能御剑护一州安宁的双手，此时也随之微微的颤抖着。之前逼出剑魂的气势，此时已然是荡然无存。¤The old man, who is known as the first sword immortal in Kyushu, is actually moistening his eyes, and his hands, which can protect the peace of a state with the sword, are trembling slightly at this time. Before forcing out the sword spirit's aura, at this time is gone.
白帝前辈尽管吩咐。¤White Emperor senior despite the command.
一时间房间里安静得只剩下倪旭欣的低语声在回响。¤A time when the room was so quiet that only Ni XuXin's whispering voice echoed.
你和他是什么关系。¤What is your relationship with him.
令人在意的痕迹？¤A trace of care?
道的化身？¤The incarnation of the Tao?
只是这监守天魔眼的玄道宗一向恃才傲物，旁人的建议恐是难以听取。不如{FirstName}{$shidi}前去天魔眼打探一番，调查一下天魔眼的禁制如今是何情况，之后我们再做其他打算。¤But the Mystic Dao Sect, which guards the Heavenly Demon Eye, has always been arrogant and proud of its talents, so I'm afraid it's difficult to listen to the advice of others. We should {FirstName}{$shidi} go to the Heavenly Demon Eye and investigate the situation of the ban on the Heavenly Demon Eye, and then we can make other plans.
你是从何处得知这段口诀的？？！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Where did you get this catchphrase from? {vpunch=10,0.5}
尤其是...天魔道。¤Especially... The Heavenly Demon Path.
此事说来话长，不过现在想来，起因就是那柄魔剑。¤It's a long story, but now that I think about it, the cause was the magic sword.
见过师祖，这位是{FirstName}{LastName}。¤Meet the Master, this is {FirstName}{LastName}.
哈哈哈，没想到隔了一千多年，我凌轩居然又有一位{$shidi}了。¤Hahahaha, I didn't expect that after a thousand years, I Ling Xuan actually have another {$shidi}.
多谢凌师兄。¤Thank you, senior brother Ling.
哦？小友找老朽有何事？¤Oh? Little friend looking for the old man what is it?
想来不仅仅是个误会，更有可能是有修士在中作梗。¤It is thought that it is not just a misunderstanding, but more likely that a cultivator is at work.
对于倪旭欣而言，这轻微的颤抖所带来的震撼无异于受古树本体全力一击！¤For Ni XuXin, the shock of this slight tremor is no different from receiving a full force blow from the ancient tree itself!
白帝的语气陡然加重，让旁听的倪旭欣也是一愣，完全不明白发生了什么。纵是之前血河老祖来强抢戮仙剑，师祖也只是轻描淡写的将之赶走罢了，如今只是一段口诀，竟然能让一向温和的白帝不顾形象地激动了起来。¤The White Emperor's tone suddenly became agitated, Ni XuXin is stunned, completely not understanding what was happening. Even when Patriarch Blood River came to rob the Immortal Executing Sword, White Emperor calmly drove him away. Now, just a paragraph has made the always gentle White Emperor agitated!
至于之后如何反目成仇又被追杀，唉，不说也罢。¤As for how they turned against each other and were hunted afterwards, alas, no more.
倪旭欣本来想靠近看看这神奇的锈剑，也是被白帝的气势逼退好几步才勉强稳住身形，若是白帝全力施为又不知该会是一番怎样的情形。¤Ni XuXin wanted to take a closer look at the rusty sword, but was suddenly forced back several steps by the White Emperor's aura before he was able to stabilise himself.
如今古神教成功渗透到宁州古迹且抢走戮仙剑，恐怕盯上宁州的其他魔门也会按捺不住。¤Now that the Ancient God Sect has successfully infiltrated the monuments in Ning Province and snatched the Immortal Executing Sword, I am afraid that the other demon sects that have their eyes on Ning Province will also be unable to hold back.
若是有机会，我定要作俑者血债血偿，以洗脱我御剑门的耻辱！¤If there is a chance, I will make sure that the culprits will pay in blood to clear the shame of the Royal Sword Sect!
故能长生...¤So can live forever...
反过来想想，我跟{FirstName}{xiongdi}关系这么好，那我不成了师祖同辈了嘛，父亲岂不是要叫我前辈了嘿嘿。¤Think about it the other way around, I have such a good relationship with {FirstName}{xiongdi}, then I'm not the same generation as the master, wouldn't my father call me senior hehehe.
你闪身让开，他们一前一后走远了。¤You dodge out of the way and they walk away one after the other.
还没等你做出反应，他们的动静已经向你靠近了。¤Before you can react, their movement is already approaching you.
{FirstName}道友，救我。¤{FirstName}Daoist, save me.
你看到在一个黑衣人和一只鲲一前一后向你奔来。¤You see a man in black and a kun running towards you, one behind the other.
“轰~轰~”前方一阵阵剧烈的能量波动传来。¤'Boom~ Boom~'' A burst of violent energy fluctuations came from ahead.
看这动静应是有人在此地交手。¤The noise must have been an exchange of blows here.
在下龙族长老，现被鲲族追杀，道友若是救我，我龙宫必有重谢。¤I am an elder of the Dragon Clan, and I am now being chased by the Kun Clan. If you, Daoist, save me, my Dragon Palace will be heavily indebted.
去客栈找落单的修士询问也许会有收获。¤Go to the inn and ask for a single cultivator who has fallen out of the way may be rewarded.
若是什么？¤If what is it?
几乎？我听说被这漩涡卷入下场只有死。¤Almost? I've heard that being caught in this vortex only ends in death.
（但若不是神魂受损，又会是什么地方出了问题呢？）¤（But if the soul is not damaged, what could have gone wrong?
好在他只是浑浑噩噩，却没有尝试伤害其他人，所以商会虽然放弃了对他的治疗，但还愿意指派几个低阶修士稍加照料，也算是留了一丝希望吧。¤The good thing is that he was only muddled, but did not try to harm others, so although the Merchant Guild gave up on his treatment, but also willing to assign a few low-ranking cultivators to take care of a little, it is also considered to leave a glimmer of hope.
要说有价值的信息，那图南漩涡的位置无疑是其中之一了。¤To say that there is valuable information, that the location of the South Tu Whirlpool is undoubtedly one of them.
这图南漩涡出现的时间不定，每次现世的时长也不尽相同。照理来说，此等异象已在这片海域为人所知多年，偶遇者、探访者岂止千百，要说有什么法宝、机缘等早也应该被掠夺殆尽。¤This figure South Tu Whirlpool appears at different times, and the length of each appearance is not the same. As a matter of fact, these visions have been known in this sea for many years, the chance encounters, visitors are not more than a thousand, to say what magic treasures, opportunities, etc. should have been plundered.
确实如此，需要我付出什么来交换这信息？¤Indeed, what do I need to pay in exchange for this information?
我们碎星商会曾对图南漩涡非常有兴趣，所以花了很多时间研究它的出现规律。不仅如此，我们还多次派遣修士前往探索，只是前往探索的修士几乎都失去音讯，并没有带来任何有价值的消息。¤We at the Shattered Star Merchant Guild were very interested in the South Tu Whirlpool, so we spent a lot of time studying its appearance pattern. Not only that, but we have also sent cultivators to explore it many times, only that the cultivators who have gone to explore it have almost all lost track of each other, and have not brought any valuable news.
原来是{FirstName}道友，如今你在无尽之海可是各大势力都想交好的大能哈哈哈，有什么想知道的，我自是知无不言言无不尽。¤So it is {FirstName} dao friend, now you are in the endless sea but the major powers want to befriend the great power hahaha, what do you want to know, I will know everything to say.
哈哈哈，道友在无尽之海名盛誉重，不知为此中安定做出了多少贡献。这区区图南漩涡的位置，我碎星商会自然是双手奉上。¤Hahahaha, the daoist friend in the endless sea of fame and reputation, I do not know how much contribution to the stability in this. The location of this South Tu Whirlpool, I shattered star Merchant Guild is naturally hands to offer.
想打听什么？¤What do you want to inquire about?
不瞒你说，其实碎星商会在最后一次探索中是有一个幸存者的，但...¤Not to hide you, in fact, the Shattered Star Merchant Guild in the last exploration is a survivor, but ...
但直至今日，也未曾听说有人从这漩涡中捞得什么好处。道友可知为何？¤But until today, I have not heard of anyone reaping any benefits from this vortex. Do you know why?
图南海可有什么值得探索的异象？¤Can there be any visions worth exploring in the South China Sea?
{FirstName}道友，可是对于图南漩涡还有其他疑问？¤{FirstName}Daoist, but do you have any other questions about the South Tu Whirlpool?
多谢道友相赠情报。¤Thanks for the gift of information, fellow Daoist.
只是这漩涡危险至极，若是深入，即便以道友{$jingjie}修为恐怕也难以全身而退，还请多加小心。¤But this vortex is extremely dangerous, if it is deep, even if you {$jingjie} cultivation is also difficult to return in one piece, please be more careful.
那个幸存者貌似只是处于一种浑浑噩噩的特殊状态，商会难道没有尝试治愈他吗？¤That survivor seems to be in a muddled and special state, did the Merchant Guild not try to cure him?
我需要五阶妖兽材料{color=#d0380a}金鹏羽{/color}，{color=#d0380a}金鹏眼{/color}，{color=#d0380a}金鹏喙{/color}和{color=#d0380a}金鹏腔骨{/color}各一份。¤I need one each of the fifth-order Spirit Beast materials {color=#d0380a}Golden Roc Feather{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Golden Roc Eye{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Golden Roc Beak{/color} and {color=#d0380a}Golden Roc Cavity Bone{/color}.
最危险？怎么说。¤Most dangerous? How to say.
贵商会对图南海的异象可有了解？¤Does your Merchant Guild have any knowledge of the vision of the South China Sea?
道友可有准备好妖兽材料？¤Do you have the Spirit Beast materials ready?
祝道友此次寻宝顺利。¤I wish you all the best in your treasure hunt.
那图南漩涡便是在图南海{color=#d0380a}东南部{/color}，按规律算来近期应是要现世了，若无其他事，建议道友可即刻启程。¤That South Tu Whirlpool is in the south {color=#d0380a} southeast {/color} of the Tu Nan Sea, according to the regular calculation should be the recent emergence, if there is no other matter, we suggest that the daoist friend can immediately depart.
那个幸存者怎样了？¤How is that survivor doing?
哎，我们何止是尝试，说是治疗神识伤害的各种手段都用尽了也不为过，只是...结果道友也看到了，商会最后选择了放弃。¤Hey, we are not only trying, said the treatment of soul sense injury of all kinds of means have been used is not too much, but ... The result is that you can see, the Merchant Guild finally chose to give up.
但显然，于你而言，更重要的是信息本身，而不是信息对他，亦或是对碎星商会的意义。¤But apparently, what is more important to you is the message itself, not what it means to him, or to the Shattered Star Merchant Guild.
那图南漩涡便是在图南海{color=#d0380a}东南部{/color}，按规律算来近期应是要现世了，若无其他事，道友可即刻启程。¤The South Tu Whirlpool is in the {color=#d0380a}southeast{/color} of South Tu Sea, according to the law should be the recent emergence of the world, if there is nothing else, you can immediately depart.
呵呵，这图南漩涡虽说出名，但它的具体位置和出现规律嘛，能掌握的势力还是很少，恕我无权不能直接相告。若是...¤Oh, this South Tu Whirlpool although famous, but its specific location and the emergence of the law well, can grasp the power or very little, forgive me for not having the right not to tell directly. If...
不错，正是之前我要求的妖兽材料。道友行事效率真是令人刮目相看。¤Yes, it is the Spirit Beast material I asked for before. The efficiency of your actions is really impressive.
是，危险到深入的修士无关实力，尽皆陨落。若不是曾有人在漩涡出现时处于其外围，从而侥幸逃脱。甚至可能没人只有这异象的存在。¤Yes, the danger to the deeper cultivators have nothing to do with strength, all fallen. If there had not been someone who was at the periphery of the vortex when it appeared and thus escaped by chance. There may not even be anyone only the existence of this vision.
听起来是挺危险的，但相比之下，我更关心它的位置在哪。¤It sounds pretty dangerous, but I'm more concerned about where it is than where it is located.
需要什么材料？¤What materials are needed?
（我在海上的恶名估计碎星商会早有耳闻，还是不去招惹他们了。）¤（I guess the Shattered Star Merchant Guild has heard of my notoriety at sea, so it's better not to mess with them.）
这图南海中最出名也最危险的异象便是这图南漩涡了，道友可是对它感兴趣？¤The most famous and dangerous vision in the South Tu Sea is this the South Tu Whirlpool.
他选择了停下来，而不是继续说下去，像是提到了什么碎星商会的隐秘，或是不想回顾的过去...¤He chose to stop rather than continue, as if mentioning some hidden secret of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild, or a past that he did not want to review...
若是道友愿意以稀有妖兽材料来交换情报，我也好向商会交代。¤If you are willing to exchange information with rare Spirit Beast materials, I can also explain to the Merchant Guild.
那个幸存者如今就在客栈，不如道友自行前去调查吧。¤That survivor is now at the inn, why don't you go ahead and investigate on your own?
听说附近的海岛上最近有出现过元婴期金鹏，道友若是找不到这些妖兽材料，可以往那寻觅一番。¤I heard that the nearby island has recently appeared on the firstborn stage of the golden roc, if you can not find these Spirit Beast materials, you can go there to search for some.
（按他这说法，那应当只是看似神魂受损，其实却不然，否则以碎星商会的手段，又怎会用尽各种灵丹尝试治疗之后，只能选择放弃。）¤（According to him, it should only seem that the soul is damaged, but in fact it is not, otherwise with the means of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild, and how will use all kinds of spiritual pills to try to treat after, can only choose to give up.）
要说异象的话，图南漩涡应该算得上一个，只是这漩涡凶险万分，道友最好还是不要尝试探索比较好。¤If you want to talk about visions, the South Tu Whirlpool should be counted as one, but this vortex is very dangerous, you'd better not try to explore better.
我还是去万宝楼问问吧。¤I'd better go to Wanbao House and ask.
就因为它过于危险？¤The reason is that it is too dangerous?
你刚上禾山，便听见两人在争吵。¤You just got up to the Wo Mountain, and you heard two people arguing.
这是我禾山道的地盘，收点过路费不是天经地义？¤This is the site of my Heshan Road. Isn't it right and proper to charge some tolls?
你是五大派的修士？我们素来井水不犯河水，你们也没有理由多管闲事吧？¤Are you a cultivator of the five sects? We have always been in the water of the well, so there is no reason for you to meddle in your own business, right?
人家禾山派本就不易，你给点过路费又有何妨？¤It's not easy for others to send Heshan, so what's the harm if you give some tolls?
借五大派的名头招摇撞骗，可叫井水不犯河水？¤Using the names of the five major factions to sway and deceive, can the well water not make the river water?
“算了，师父让我教训散修，自然有他的道理。”¤Forget it, Master told me to teach the independent Cultivators a lesson, so naturally he has his reasons.
五大派究竟给过你们什么好处？我怎么没听说过？¤What benefits did the five factions give you? How did I not hear it being said?
自然是没有来往，但既然人家占理，我也不好坐视不管。¤Naturally, there is no contact, but since others are in charge, it is not easy for me to sit back and watch.
哼，说多无益。¤Huh, what a pointless talk.
你怎知道五大派没给过我们好处？废话少说，不给就别想采药。¤How do you know that the five factions have not benefited us? Don't talk nonsense, don't think about taking medicine if you don't give it.
……我不知道你在说什么。¤……I do not know what you're talking about.
“算了，师父总不会真的让我去帮邪修吧…”¤Forget it, Master won't really let me help the evil cultivators...
收过路费也能占理？究竟是占了什么理？¤Can I also pay for tolls? What's the point?
“这应该就是师父提到的邪修吧。”¤This should be the evil cultivator mentioned by Master.
“奇怪，师父说的散修到底是指禾山的邪修还是这个散修？究竟该帮谁？”¤Strange, when Master said independent Cultivators, does he mean the evil cultivators of Wo Mountain or this independent Cultivator? Who exactly should I help?
好……我看你们就是一伙的，多说无益，出手吧。¤Okay...I think you guys are a group, it's useless to talk about it, let's do it.
你是五大派的修士？难道真与禾山派这群邪修有来往？¤Are you a cultivator of the five sects? Could it be that he really had contact with this group of evil cultivators from the Heshan faction?
什么收过路费，你怎么不去收五大派的过路费？分明就是看我们散修好欺负。¤Why don't you collect tolls from the five major factions? Just because it's easy to bully independent cultivators like us!
我们五大派不也都有自己的圈地？外人想进连过路费都没处给。如今禾山道的人只是收个过路费，又为何不占理？¤Don't our five factions also have their own enclosures? Outsiders who want to enter are not even given tolls. Today, the people on Heshan Road only charge a toll, so why don't they take care of it?
我有什么好心虚的，苗矮你不要血口喷人！¤What do I have to be vain, Miao Dwarf you do not blood spit!
好，请通羽前辈过目。¤Good, please pass through senior Tong Yu.
{FirstName}道友可是我找来的帮手，当然非同一般。¤Fellow daoist {FirstName} is the helper I found, they're extraordinary.
通羽前辈过誉了，若是没有您的帮衬，我也没这么容易对付栖云真人。¤Senior Tong Yu is too kind, if not for your help, I wouldn't have been able to deal with Real Quyun so easily.
栖云，你竟敢对我的客人出手，是何用意？¤Quyun, how dare you strike out at my guest, what is your intention?
多谢通羽前辈。¤Thank you, Senior Tong Yu.
不过心儿说的倒是没错，小友的实力真是让老夫讶异，竟能与金丹期修士短时间内不分伯仲。后生可畏啊。¤But what Xin'er said is correct, the strength of the young friend really surprised the Patriarch, how can be no match for a short time with the jindan stage Vagrant Cultivator. The new generation can be feared.
至于金丹之下，更是只有那些传说中天赋异禀的怪物，才能与小友比试一番了。后生可畏啊。¤As for the Golden Dan, only those legendary monsters with extraordinary talent can compete with you. The new generation is fearful.
从今日起，{FirstName}小友以后便是我林府座上宾客，可以随意出入林府。¤From today onwards, little friend {FirstName} will be my guest in the Lin House, and can enter and leave the Lin House at will.
通羽接过玉简检视起来，苗矮则紧盯着栖云，后者也只能面色不善的瞪着你，却毫无办法。¤The jade briefs were examined by Tong Yu, and Miao Shorty was staring at Quyun, who could only stare at you with an unpleasant expression, but nothing could be done.
栖云，据这玉简记载，你吞没家族财产，接受冲虚散人贿赂，可是属实？¤Qi Yun, according to this jade slip, you engulfed the family property and accepted bribes from Chongxu Sanren, but is it true?
还好倪旭欣没留在城中，不然找他帮忙肯定不如你靠谱，嘿嘿。¤Fortunately, Ni XuXin did not stay in the city, or find his help is certainly not as reliable as you, hehe.
哼！执迷不悟！¤Hmph! Persistent!
不过瞬息之间，你与栖云真人已交手数回合，但毕竟对方是金丹期强者，在他手下你恐怕是难以支撑更久。¤But in an instant, you and Quyun real has exchanged several rounds, but after all, the other party is a strong Jindan stage, under him you are afraid that it is difficult to support longer.
心儿说的倒是没错，小友的实力真是让老夫讶异，纵是面对其他金丹前期的修士，估计也是难逢敌手。¤The strength of the young friend really surprised me, even in the face of other pre-Jindan Vagrant Cultivators, I guess it is difficult to meet the enemy.
即使如此，还请{FirstName}小友把玉简拿出来，让我们看看到底是怎么一回事。¤Even so, please {FirstName} little friend to take out the jade slip, so that we can see what is going on.
哼，什么以家族利益为先，我看是心虚罢。之前我还不知道这位小友为何出现在此，但现在可算是看明白了。¤I think it's a weakness of heart. Before I did not know why this young friend appeared here, but now I can see it.
林沐心吐了吐舌头，但对你的感激与躲过逼婚的兴奋之情还是言溢于表。¤Lin MuXin spit out his tongue, but your gratitude and the excitement of avoiding a forced marriage is still overflowing with words.
侥幸而已，若不是栖云真人此前已有暗伤，只怕没这么简单。¤It was just a fluke, if it wasn't for the fact that Master Qiyun had been injured before, I'm afraid it wouldn't be so simple.
小友不必谦虚，年纪轻轻能与栖云斗上数个回合已是很难得了。¤You don't have to be modest. It's rare to be able to fight Quyun for several rounds at a young age.
小友实力强大还心性过人，实属难得。¤It seems the heart of this little friend is quite just; not to mention that you're pretty strong.
通羽前辈过誉了，若是没有您的帮衬，我早就败在栖云真人手下了。¤Senior Tongyu is too kind, if not for your timely intervention I would have been defeated under their real power.
苗矮上人强行收走栖云真人的法宝后，押着他往不知何处去了，只留你，通羽上人，林沐心三人在长老堂。¤After forcibly taking away Quyun Zhen's magic treasure, Supreme Miao Dwarf escorted him to an unknown destination, leaving only you, Supreme Tong Yu, and Lin MuXin in the Hall of Elders.
就在你思考如何是好时，通羽上人与苗矮上人却已是一前一后包夹栖云，令其难有较大动作，更不用说再次对你出手。¤Just when you think about how to be good, Tong Yu Shangren and Miao Dwarf Shangren but is already a front and a back package Quyun, so that it is difficult to have a larger action, let alone again on your hand.
我栖云心系家族，怎可能私吞财产，不利家族！是这小贼污蔑我！¤My family is very close to my heart, so how could I possibly embezzle my property to the detriment of my family? It's this little thief who slandered me!
呵呵，栖云时时刻刻以家族利益为先，财政大权交予你还真是没错。¤The first thing you need to do is to get the best out of it.
大长老，你的客人闯入我的居所，还触动了禁制，先不说触犯了我的忌讳，甚至还可能窥视了家族机密，不尽早击杀，难道还等机密泄露出去？¤Grand Elder, your guest barged into my residence, and also touched the ban, not to mention offending my taboo, and may have even spied on the family Skill, do not kill as early as possible, do you still wait for the Skill to leak out?
嘻嘻，多谢道友，没想到你居然这么强，竟然可以在栖云长老手下撑这么久。¤Hee hee, thank you, fellow Daoist, I didn't expect you to be so strong, to be able to support Elder Qiyun for so long.
哈哈哈，心儿说的是。那我们林家也不能让心儿的帮手白忙活一番。¤The first time I saw you, I was in the middle of the game. Then our Lin family can't let Xin'er's helpers work for nothing.
嘻嘻，没想到道友实力竟如此强横，竟能在短时间内击败栖云长老。¤Hee hee, I didn't expect that fellow Daoist was so powerful that he could defeat Elder Qiyun in a short period of time.
{FirstName}小友不必客气，那老朽便先去处理家事了，小友请自便。¤{FirstName} little friend, don't be polite, the old man will take care of the housework first, little friend please do it yourself.
哈哈哈，心儿说的是。不过，我们林家可不能让小友白忙一趟。¤Hahaha, what Xin'er said is right. However, our Lin family can't let little friend make a trip for nothing.
咳咳...若不是我此前被二小姐用法宝击伤，哪轮得到你这小辈猖狂！¤Cough cough... If it wasn't for me being injured by the second lady's magic weapon earlier, which round would I have gotten you this junior to be crazy!
哼，先不说你说小友曾进入你房间才含怒出手，这玉简可是有你的神识印记，{FirstName}小友要如何污蔑于你？还有什么要说的等家主闭关出来跟他说去吧！¤Hmph, let's not say that you said that the little friend entered your room before you shot in anger. This jade slip has the imprint of your soul sense. How can the little friend {FirstName} slander you? If there is anything else to say, wait for the master to come out of retreat and tell him!
终于，栖云真人被你神通击破灵气护盾，匆忙中脚下一个不稳便跌坐在地。苗矮上人也是趁势压制栖云真人。¤Finally, Quyun real person by your divine ability to break the aura shield, in a hurry a foot unstable will fall to the ground. Miao Dwarf superior is also taking advantage of the situation to suppress Quyun real person.
{FirstName}小友不必客气，这是你应得的。那老朽便先去处理家事了，小友请自便。¤{FirstName}You don't have to be polite, you deserve it. I'll go take care of my family business, so please make yourself comfortable.
除此之外，{FirstName}小友以后便是我林府座上宾客，可以随意出入林府。¤The first thing I want to do is to get to know the people who are going to be in the house.
心儿，不得妄语。¤The heart, no delusion.
不过，他为了这炼妖散甚至放弃了诛仙剑和他师父的命令，说明他很是看重这炼妖散。¤However, the fact that he had even given up the Immortal Punishing Sword and his master's orders for this Demon Refining Scatter showed that he valued it very much.
相比起这些，更让我忧心的是玄骨。¤What worries me more than all this is the Xuanbone.
最后轩岚诺提及的玄骨的师傅...完了找机会打听一下这玄骨的师傅是何方人士吧。¤The last thing Xuan Lan Nuo mentioned was Xuan Bone's master... I'll find out who the master of Xuan Bone is when I'm done.
没想到这振兴玄古门徒做他人嫁衣啊。¤I didn't expect this revitalisation of the Profound Ancient disciples to be the graft of others.
这蜕凡化神哪有那么容易，一剂药石就可度过？这小子不把自己也变成不人不鬼的疯子就不错了。¤How can it be so easy to reach Deity Transformation with a single dose of medicine? It would be nice if this kid didn't turn himself into an inhuman madman as well.
是的。¤Yes it is.
这一次他若是真的完善了炼妖散，那下一次见面说不定就是化神大能了，可就真是心腹大患了。¤If he really perfects the Demon Refining Scatter this time, then the next time we meet it might be a Deity Transformation Power, which would be a real heartbreaker.
这修真界本就是尔虞我诈，稍有不慎就是身死道消。相比起玄古门，那些豹麟兽又是何其无辜，就因为麒麟血惨遭横祸。¤In this world of cultivation, it is all about deceit and deceit, and the slightest mistake can lead to death. Compared to the Profound Ancient Clan, the Leopard Lin Beasts are so innocent that they have suffered because of the Qilin blood.
你和一旁的众人见状不妙，也帮着出手，一连串五颜六色的法术向玄骨道人飞去，他也只好闪身避开。¤When you and the people on the side saw a bad situation, you also helped out. A series of colorful spells flew towards the Taoist Profound Ancient, and he had no choice but to avoid it.
突然一阵剧烈的震动打断了修士们的沟通，束缚那剑的锁链不知何时被人截断一条，被禁锢许久的煞气终于找到突破口，来势汹汹地向你们奔袭而来。¤A sudden violent shock interrupted the communication between the cultivators, and the chain that bound the sword was cut off at some point. The evil spirit that had been imprisoned for a long time finally found a breakthrough and rushed toward you fiercely.
在你运起功法，刚准备出手时，恒如真人也注意到了你。¤When you started your kung fu and were just about to strike, the real Heng Ru also noticed you.
既然如此，只能竭力一搏了！¤In that case, I can only try my best!
不如这样，我们事先约定好...¤It's not as good as this, let's make an appointment in advance...
长老，你没事...咕啊......！¤Elder, you're okay... huh...!
恒如真人竟是古神教的卧底...你并不能估测他的实力，并没有贸然出手。¤Lord Eternal Harmony is actually an undercover agent of the Ancient Gods Cult...you are unable to tell how strong he is, and did not make a move rashly.
恒如长老，你在做什么！还不快来巩固阵法！¤Elder Eternal Harmony, what are you doing! Hurry and reinforce the formation!
那位上前询问的化尘教修士以极其扭曲的姿势跌倒在地，而本应被煞气重伤的恒如真人却毫发无损地直立起身，手中还残存着一团诡异的灵气。¤The Aeonic Sands cultivator who stepped forward to question fell to the ground twisted and contorted, while Lord Eternal Harmony, who was supposed to be seriously injured by the evil spirit, stood up unscathed, with a strange energy still in his hands.
{FirstName}道友，我们好歹师徒一场，你当真要与我为敌？¤{FirstName}Daoist, we are at least master and disciple, do you really want to make an enemy of me?
既然魔剑已经现世，绝不能将它继续留在此地。否则若是被魔修偷走，后果不堪设想。¤Since the Demon Sword is already present, it must not be left here. Otherwise, if it is stolen by the evil cultivator, the consequences will be disastrous.
哼，没想到你命这么大。¤Hmph, I didn't expect your life to be so big.
一道人影倒飞出去，摔进了人群中，随即猛烈的煞气从阵法缺口源源不断地涌入。虽有几位修士反应迅速地合力填补空缺，但阵内的煞气依旧在其中乱窜，人群很快便陷入了混乱中。¤A figure flew out and fell into the crowd, and then violent evil spirits poured in continuously from the gap in the formation. Although several cultivators responded quickly and joined forces to fill the gaps, the evil spirits in the formation still ran wildly in it. The crowd soon fell into chaos.
看来你这些年也没有原地踏步，我今日还有要事处理，就先施舍你几日活头。¤It seems that you haven't stood still in these years. I still have important things to deal with today, so I will give you a few days to live.
玄骨老祖，竟然是你！¤Patriarch Dark Bones, it turned out to be you!
那是化尘教恒如长老一直带在身边的亲传弟子。¤That's the direct disciple that Elder Eternal Harmony of the Aeonic Sands Temple always has at his side.
巩固？哈哈哈哈，我这就来巩固！¤Consolidate? Hahahaha, I will consolidate!
玄骨？¤Profound Ancient?
正在你试图和魏无极交谈时，众人的气氛已经开始剑拔弩张起来。¤As you are trying to talk to Wei Wuji, the atmosphere of the crowd has begun to grow.
明河剑仙与玄伶仙子一同祭起飞剑，上百柄金色与蓝色的灵气飞剑迅速张开，将众人笼罩在内。但煞气攻势凶猛，阵法壁垒很快便出现了松动的迹象。¤Swordmaster Radiant River and Lady Starsong summoned their swords in unity. Hundreds of flying swords made of gold and azure energy materialized, enveloping everyone in a protective formation. But the baleful energy was relentless, and the barrier soon showed signs of weakening.
你怎么了？¤what happened to you?
那古神教护法面色一冷，一道幽紫的寒芒自他手中射出，竟穿过阵法护壁径直向公孙季袭去。公孙季连施法决，驱动一个盾状法宝将寒芒抵住。¤The ancient god guardian's face became cold, and a purple cold glow shot from his hand, and went straight through the formation barrier to attack Gongsun Ji. Gongsun Jilian cast a spell, driving a shield-shaped magic weapon to resist the cold glow.
好在剩下的众人此时也暂时放下争辩，以极快的速度加入维护阵法的行列，煞气冲击下阵法发出五光十色的华彩，你紧盯着剑所在的方位，在一片绚烂的光中猛地发现了一位十分眼熟的修士。¤Fortunately, the rest of the people also temporarily put aside their arguments at this time, and joined the ranks of defending the formation at an extremely fast speed. Under the impact of the evil spirits, the formation gave out a colorful splendor. You stare at the direction of the sword, in a gorgeous A very familiar cultivator was suddenly found in the light.
不过...我巩固的当然是我古神教的大计了！！！¤But... of course what I consolidate is the grand plan of my ancient gods!!!
竟是戮仙剑...此剑绝对不能落入魔门手中！¤It was actually the Immortal Executing Sword... This sword must never fall into the hands of the Demon Sect!
明河，结阵！¤Radiant River, initiate formation!
这玄机散人果然深不可测，应当也算是当时的旷世奇才，天道当真造化弄人。¤This mysterious scattered people is really unfathomable. It should be regarded as a masterful wizard at that time, and the way of heaven is really good for people.
戮仙剑？！此剑相传不是在白帝手中？¤Immortal Executing Sword?! According to legend, this sword is not in the hands of Emperor Bai?
一口鲜血喷出，黑心老人强行接住了这一招，却已受了内伤。¤A mouthful of blood spurted out, and the Grandfather Blackheart forcibly caught the move, but he had already suffered internal injuries.
多说无益，接招。¤It's useless to say more, just take it.
多说无益，出手吧。¤The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on it.
尖锐的惨叫与恒如真人嚣张的笑声一同响起，你决定...¤Sharp screams and Lord Eternal Harmony's arrogant laughter ring out in unison, you decide to...
而守护你们的大阵正逐渐收缩，阵内的修士也都做好了发起进攻的准备。¤And the big formation guarding you is gradually shrinking, and the cultivators in the formation are all ready to attack.
戮仙剑在古神教长老的掌控下邪光大放，大殿内一时煞气暴涨，连空间都出现了些许不稳定的裂痕。他双手紧握剑柄，似乎在酝酿着什么。¤The Immortal Executing Sword was released under the control of the elders of the ancient gods. The evil spirit in the hall skyrocketed for a while, and even some unstable cracks appeared in the space. He gripped the hilt with both hands, and it seemed that something was brewing.
你在衡州犯下如此行径，早就人尽皆知了。¤You have committed such an act in Hengzhou. Everyone has long known it.
能混入化尘教中卧底多年，此人果然实力不俗，他双目通红，显然已施展了魔门秘术，操控着飞沙与数人交战还能不落下风。¤He has been undercover in the Huachen Cult for many years. This person is really strong. His eyes are red, and he has obviously performed the magic secret technique, controlling Feisha and fighting several people without losing the wind.
你们终于来到地宫的最深处，粗粝石块拼筑成的大殿中最先映入眼帘的是一柄由煞气凝聚的大剑，那凝实的煞气甚至轻微地扭曲了周围的空间，恐怕愈往地下煞气愈浓厚的原因正是此物。¤You finally come to the deepest part of the underground palace. The first thing you see in the hall made of rough stones is a big sword condensed by evil spirits. The solid evil spirits even slightly distort the surrounding space. I'm afraid this is the reason why the evil spirit becomes stronger as you go underground.
这柄剑被灵气极浓的锁链牢牢地栓在刻满阵法的圆形石台上，而锁链的另一端则固定在殿内厚朴的粗大支柱及精巧的彩色围栏上。¤This sword is firmly bolted to a circular stone platform engraved with formations by a very strong chain, and the other end of the chain is fixed to the thick and simple pillars and exquisite colored fences in the temple.
明河老儿，这宝贝因当是有缘者得之，我看你分明就是自己贪图宝物，又何必找什么冠冕堂皇的理由。¤Old Radiant River, this treasure should be obtained by someone who is fated for it. I think you are clearly greedy for treasures, so why bother to find a high-standing reason.
紫芒一瞬间迸射出无数漆黑的藤蔓，黑心老人掌中凝聚一点青色冷光，凭空出现一道屏障将藤曼接住。¤Zimang shot out countless dark vines in an instant, and a little blue cold light was condensed in the palm of the Grandfather Blackheart, and a barrier appeared out of thin air to catch Tengman.
你...你又突破了？¤You... did you break through again?
盾牌与寒芒一接触，公孙季便知不妙。只见还围着公孙季身子的另外两面盾牌越转越快，他的头上汗冒了出来，嘴角也沁出了血丝。¤As soon as the shield came into contact with Hanmang, Gongsun Ji knew it was bad. I saw that the other two shields that were still surrounding Gongsunji's body turned faster and faster, sweat bursting out of his head, and bloodshot from the corners of his mouth.
那古神教护法不知使用了何种神通，在躁动的煞气中一把攫住漂浮在其中的魔剑。¤That Guardian of ancient gods sect starts using an unknown spell, grabbing the evil magic sword floating in evil spiritual energy.
他的一声大喝让所有人的注意瞬间集中在那里，你们光是抵御煞气便已耗去大半人力——那位化尘教修士几乎浸沐在狂暴的煞气中却毫发无损。¤His loud shout made everyone's attention instantly concentrated there. You have consumed most of your manpower just to resist the evil spirits-the cultivator of the dust was almost immersed in the violent evil spirits but was unscathed.
啊！！！！！¤what!!!!!
谁在那里！¤Who is there!
在场的诸位都是宁州一等一的高手，那魔修如何能偷得此剑，简直天方夜谭！¤All of you present are first-rate masters in Ning Province, how can the evil cultivator steal this sword? It's a fantasy!
不错，此行竟能得到戮仙剑，真乃天道有眼，哈哈。¤Yes, this trip can actually get the Immortal Executing Sword, it is true that Heaven has the eyes, haha.
那古神教护法面色一冷，一道幽紫的寒芒自他手中射出，竟穿过阵法护壁径直向黑心老人袭去。¤The guardian of the ancient gods became cold, and a dark purple glow shot out of his hand, passing through the wall of the formation and attacking the Grandfather Blackheart.
哦？想不到此地还有人知晓我的名号？¤Oh? Unexpectedly, anyone here knows my name?
我自然会活得比你更久。¤I will naturally live longer than you.
恒如真人掌心的灵气团逐渐扩大，在阵法内游荡的煞气竟逐渐被吸收进去，不过两息间那光团便凝成人头大小，而后被他掷进维持阵法的几位修士中。¤The Qi condensed in the palm of Lord Eternal Harmony began to expand, absorbing the baleful energy within the formation. In the span of two breaths, the energy condensed to the size of a human head and Eternal Harmony toss it between the other cultivators within the array.
若是魔剑还没取出，我们就先争吵拼斗起来，实在有些可笑。¤If before the magic sword has been taken out were we to quarrel and fight first, that would be really ridiculous.
你将灵力汇于双目，仔细地观察着那锁链，发现其上竟以阴文刻录着许多你识不清的上古文字。¤You gather your spiritual power in your eyes and observe the chain carefully, and you find that there are many ancient characters that you can't read clearly in inscribed on it.
诸位，且不说这魔剑还未解除封印，即便能够取下，想必也不是人人都能驾驭的了。¤Everyone, not to mention that this magic sword has not yet lifted the seal, even if it can be removed, it must not be controllable by everyone.
哼，我今日还有要事处理，就先施舍你们几日活头。¤Hmph, I still have important matters to deal with today, so I will give you a few days to live.
在你犹豫之时，几位修士已祭出法宝冲上前去，与恒如真人战成一团。¤While you hesitated, several cultivators rushed forward with their artifacts and began battle with Lord Eternal Harmony.
我说，老头儿，这剑或许与先前我们遇到的有些关联，你认识他刻的那些文字吗？¤I said, old man, this sword may have something to do with what we encountered earlier. Do you know the words he engraved?
这剑煞气四溢，分明就是当年魔修遗落在此地的魔剑！今日我定要将其带回宗门，妥善处置。¤This sword is full of evil spirits, and it is clearly the magic sword that was left here by the evil cultivators! Today I will take it back to the sect and dispose of it properly.
这两个笨蛋还是交由白帝楼发落吧。¤These two idiots should be handed over to Baidilou.
伤人的树妖终于灰飞烟灭，匪徒却也都被融成了烂泥。懒得管这摊黑吃黑残局的你，重新上路。¤The wounding tree demon was finally wiped out, but the gangsters were all melted into mud. I didn't bother to take care of you, who was eating the black endgame, and started again.
没想到这树妖修为竟如此高深，你也再顾不得什么斩妖除魔，头也不回的跑了...¤Unexpectedly, this tree demon's cultivation is so advanced, you don't care about slaying demons, and ran away without looking back...
精彩，精彩！{FirstName}道友的神通真是让在下大开眼界。宁王府找的便是你这样能人，你可愿意随我去面见宁王？¤Wonderful, wonderful! The magical powers of the Taoist friends of {FirstName} really opened Xia Xia's eyes. Prince Ning's mansion is looking for a capable person like you. Would you like to let me meet Ning King?
能为宁王效劳是在下的荣幸。¤It is an honor to be able to serve Ning King.
他收起扇子朝你拱了拱手，虽唇角含笑但面上阴鸷之色仍存，像是故作轻松。¤He puts away the fan and arches his hand towards you. Although the corners of his lips are smiling, the color of the dark predator still remains, as if pretending to be relaxed.
（为了荣华富贵去替宁王卖命，恐怕我仙途就于此断送了...）¤(For the sake of prosperity and wealth, I went to work for Ning King, I'm afraid my Xiantu will be ruined here...)
精彩，精彩！金道友的神通真是让在下大开眼界。宁王府找的便是你这样能人，你可愿意随我去面见宁王？¤Wonderful, wonderful! Fellow Jin Daoist's magical powers really opened her eyes. Prince Ning's mansion is looking for a capable person like you. Would you like to meet Ning King with me?
哈哈哈，能为宁王效劳是在下的荣幸，请！¤Hahaha, it is an honor to be able to serve Ning King, please!
道友法力高超，金某佩服至极。¤Friends of Daoist mana are superb, Jin admires extremely.
他收起扇子朝你拱了拱手，虽唇角含笑，却流露出几分讥讽。这般貌是心非的人修真界并不少见，你心中厌恶，自然也不与他多说。¤He put away the fan and arched his hand towards you. Although the corners of his lips are smiling, he shows a bit of sarcasm. It is not uncommon for a person of this kind to behave like this in the cultivation world. You hate it in your heart, so naturally you won't talk to him.
你只觉得仿佛被毒蛇盯上一样令人生厌，于是草草应付几句了事。¤You just think it's annoying as if you are being stared at by a poisonous snake, so you have to deal with it hastily.
你看得通透，人间金钱权利不能打动你分毫。只有坚守道心，方能在漫漫仙途中觅得长生。¤You can see clearly, the human rights of money can't move you at all. Only by sticking to the Taoist heart can you find longevity on the long journey to immortality.
这位道友请随我离开秘境吧，你的测试已经失败了。¤This fellow Taoist, please leave the secret realm with me, your test has failed.
你仔细观察这些散落一地的藤蔓，藤蔓内的经络不断向外渗出鲜红色的，仿佛血液一般的液体。¤You carefully observe these scattered vines, the meridians inside the vines constantly seep out a bright red, blood-like liquid.
你下意识的尝试用这种新的运气方式施展木系神通，召唤而来的藤蔓果真与平日不同，似乎也具备了某种吸人精血的能力！¤You subconsciously try to use this new way of luck to display the magical powers of the wood element. The summoned vine fruit is really different from usual, and it seems to have a certain ability to suck human blood!
这魔藤果然神奇，韧性强又不怕烈火炙烤，若是用来炼器简直是再好不过了。¤This magic vine is really amazing. It is tough and not afraid of being burned by fire. If it is used for refining, it would be great.
谁知这藤蔓在火焰的炙烤下竟丝毫没有要被烧毁的样子，反倒像是经过了炼制一般，光泽更胜以往。¤Who knows that this vine does not appear to be burnt in the slightest under the flames, but it seems to have been refined, and its luster is better than before.
领悟神通：{color=#d0380a}汲血藤{/color}¤Understanding magical powers: {color=#d0380a}King Xue Vine{/color}
没想到这次因祸得福，也算是不虚此行了。¤Unexpectedly, this time a blessing in disguise is a worthwhile trip.
你隐约感觉这种植物的经络走向似乎与修真者灵气的运行方式有异曲同工之妙，看来这种能够吸人精血的能力便是与它有关。¤You vaguely feel that the meridian direction of this plant seems to be similar to the way the spiritual energy of the cultivator works. It seems that this ability to suck human blood is related to it.
你隐约感觉这种植物的经络走向似乎与修真者灵气的运行方式有异曲同工之妙，但其中具体的玄妙之处却难以领悟。¤You vaguely feel that the meridian direction of this plant seems to be similar to the way the spiritual energy of the cultivator works, but the specific mystery is hard to comprehend.
你用同样的方法烤制了散落一地的藤蔓，然后心满意足的将它们统统收入囊中。¤You used the same method to roast the vines scattered all over the place, and then you put them all in your bag with satisfaction.
你捏了个手印，召来火焰想要将这些剩余的藤蔓烧个干净，以免留下祸害。¤You pinched a handprint and summoned the flame to burn these remaining vines clean so as not to leave harm.
被你切得四分五裂的藤蔓在地上翻动着，看上去还没有死透。你想起藤蔓能够吸人精血的诡异能力，不禁也感到有些后怕。¤The vine you cut torn apart is turning on the ground, and it doesn't look like it's completely dead. When you think of the vine's weird ability to suck human blood, you can't help but feel a little afraid.
你尝试领悟刚刚幻象所施展的法术，但始终无法领悟其中的要领，只能先放弃了。¤You tried to comprehend the spell cast by the illusion, but you still can't comprehend the essentials, you have to give up first.
也不知这是门内哪位前辈所创的法术，当真精妙。¤I'm not sure if this is a secret skill left here by an inner sect elder... It's very subtle.
不愧是幻雾阵，看来我还要在修炼些时日。¤It's a Mirage Mist Array, it seems that I will still be cultivating for some time.
领悟法术：{color=#d0380a}青蛇劲{/color}¤Comprehended Spell: {color=#d0380a}Azure Snake Art{/color}
刚刚那道幻象所用的法术似乎暗藏玄机...¤The spell used by the illusion just now seems to have hidden mystery...
你在脑海中不断推演刚刚幻象所施展的法术，终于成功领悟了其中的要领。¤You kept replaying the spell over and over in your mind. Finally, you comprehend the basics of the technique you saw.
钟道友，路上小心。¤Daoist Zhong, be careful on your way.
原来是{FirstName}道友，我虽久居麟庙却也对你早有耳闻了。¤So it's {FirstName}, I've heard about you even though I've lived in the Lin Temple for a long time.
我此行匆忙身无长物，这几枚血菩提还请{shidi}收下。¤I am in a hurry on this trip and I have nothing with me, so please {shidi} accept these blood bodhi.
说来也是我大意，险些着了他们的道。¤I was careless, to say the least, and nearly fell into their trap.
道友身受重伤可是需要我送你回去？¤Do you need me to take you back because you are seriously injured?
一株草药向你飞来。¤A herb comes flying towards you.
一个少年出现在他身后，仅仅一击就洞穿了他的胸口。¤A teenager appeared behind him and pierced his chest with just one blow.
平时看不出来，这傻鸟带着天蟾子竟然也有如此遁速必是精于遁术的妖修，而天蟾子刚刚迸发出恐怖的妖气已是远超一般元婴妖兽。¤It was not apparent that this silly bird with the Heavenly Toad had such a speed of evasion, but it must be a evil cultivator skilled in the art of evasion, and the Heavenly Toad had just burst out with a terrifying demonic aura that far surpassed that of ordinary YuanYing Spirit Beasts.
道友，此番凶险多亏你了。¤Fellow Daoist, it is thanks to you that this is a fierce adventure.
钟师兄，路上小心。¤Brother Zhong, be careful on your way.
我就先行回去疗伤了。¤I will go back first to heal my wounds.
我之前有事来此处理，但是抵达此地时却是中伏了。¤I had to come here to take care of something, but when I arrived here I was ambushed.
{FirstName}长老，此番凶险多亏你了。¤{FirstName}Elder, thanks to you for this fierce danger.
远处两道强悍的气息飞速接近。¤In the distance two powerful auras approached at speed.
钟师兄怎么会被古神教的宵小困于此地。¤How could Senior Brother Zhong be trapped here by the curmudgeons of the Ancient God Sect.
客气了，道友为何会被这古神教的妖人在此伏击？¤You are very kind. Why were you ambushed here by the demons of this Ancient God Sect?
平时叫你好好练功，一天天就知道倒腾炼器。现在神识被封发挥不出来了吧？¤Usually I tell you to practice well, but all you know how to do is to refine weapons. Now your soul sense is blocked and you can't use it anymore, right?
言毕，三人化作一到遁光直奔离火门方向。¤After speaking, the three of them transformed into a vanish of light and headed straight for the direction of the Heavenly Fire Gate.
阿焰，我们来啦！！！¤Flame, here we come!!!
这只鹤虽是元婴初期但看近的速度必是精于遁术的妖修，而那只蛤蟆刚刚迸发出恐怖的妖气已是远超一般元婴妖兽。¤The crane is at the early stage of the first generation but the speed of the approaching must be a evil cultivator skilled in the art of evasion, while the toad has just burst forth with a terrifying demonic aura that is far beyond the average first generation Spirit Beast.
谁？！！¤Who?!!!
人我带走了啊，你先和那傻鸟回去吧。¤I'll take the man with me. You go back with the silly bird first.
多谢，道友出手相救。在下离火门绝焰堂大长老钟焰，敢问阁下姓名？¤Thank you, fellow Daoist, for coming to my rescue. I am Zhong Yan, Grand Elder of the Heavenly Fire Gate's Absolute Flame Hall, may I ask your name?
（看来这离火门内部也是....）¤(It seems that the inside of this Heavenly Fire Gate is also ....)
我之前得知此地有人搜捕豹麟兽，但是抵达此地时却是中伏了。¤I had been told that there was a search for the Leopard Linnets, but when I arrived here I was ambushed.
多谢，{shidi}出手相救。¤Thanks, {shidi} for coming to the rescue.
不必了，此阵一破我就通知同门前来接我了。¤There is no need for that. Once this formation is broken, I will inform my fellow disciples to come and get me.
哼，三脚猫的本事也想学人做英雄。¤Hmph, you want to be a hero even with your three-legged skills.
离火门也是卧虎藏龙啊。¤The Heavenly Fire Gate is also full of crouching tigers and hidden dragons.
我拖住他，你快走！¤I'll hold him off, you get out of here!
不必了，此阵一破我就通知傻鸟他们前来接我了。¤There's no need for that. Once this formation is broken, I'll tell the silly birds to come and get me.
三脚猫的本事也想学人劫道？\n¤You want to be a robber even if you have the skills of a three-legged man? \n
道友目前在千流岛已名声卓越，出于对道友实力的慎重考虑，我们的赔率将会下调些许，望道友见谅。¤The Daoists are now well-known in Qianliu Island. Due to careful consideration of the strength of the Daoists, our odds will be lowered a bit. I hope the Daoists will forgive me.
凭借记忆你来到通往圣坛的门前，正准备破阵时，从旁突然冲出几个修士将你团团围住！¤With your memory, you came to the door leading to the altar, and when you were about to break the formation, a few cultivators suddenly rushed out to surround you!
幸好这些修士的修为并不高深，你三下五除二解决掉这些修士，不禁想到他们的行动或许并非出自本愿，也许在什么地方有人正操纵着他们向你所在的方向赶来。¤Fortunately, these cultivators are not advanced. If you get rid of these cultivators, you can't help but think that their actions may not be based on their original wishes. Maybe someone is manipulating them to come in your direction.
这阵法有些深奥，我还是想想别的办法吧。¤This formation is a bit profound, I still think of other ways.
{w}{w=0.5}厚重的大门上刻着繁复的阵法花纹，看来其上应杂糅了多个精妙的阵法，你选择...¤{w}{w=0.5}The thick gate is engraved with complicated formation patterns. It seems that there should be a number of subtle formations mixed on it, you choose...
凭着记忆，你悄无声息地潜入圣地深处。¤With your memory, you sneaked into the depths of the Holy Land silently.
此处阵法深奥复杂，你平日积累的阵道学识也不足以覆盖阵法的全貌，你在此花费了一些时间。¤The formation method is profound and complicated, and the formation knowledge you have accumulated on a daily basis is not enough to cover the full picture of the formation method. You have spent some time here.
经过方才与煞魔的斗争，前来此地的修士伤亡众多。方才几位落单的修士皆成了煞魔的爪下亡魂，你们心中知晓此地凶险无比，单独行动恐怕风险极大。¤After the struggle with the Sha demon, the cultivators who came here have suffered many casualties. The few cultivators who have just been alone have become the dead souls of the Sha demon. You know in your hearts that this place is extremely dangerous, and acting alone may be extremely risky.
好在此地构造并不复杂，只有一条略显陡峭的石梯蜿蜒向下，大概沿着台阶走上几圈便可到达地底，所以并未再出现方才那样争先冒险的情况。¤Fortunately, the structure of this place is not complicated. There is only a slightly steep stone ladder winding down, and you can reach the underground after a few laps along the steps, so there is no such thing as rushing to take the first risk.
呼...哈...！呼......¤Huh...ha...! Huh...
百里奇正全心全意地钻研体术，一时没有注意到你的存在。¤Balic is studying physical skills wholeheartedly and didn't notice your presence for a while.
这宁州古迹已有万年历史，其中定有使我体术更近一层的功法神通，若能顺便寻几件宝物更是锦上添花，哈哈！¤This historic site in Ning Province has a history of 10,000 years. There must be magical powers that bring my physical skills closer. If you can find a few treasures by the way, it will be the icing on the cake, haha!
我这伤还得有一些时日才能养好，这段时间，你便与老夫一同住在这破庙里。¤My injury will take some time to heal. During this time, you will live with the old man in this ruined temple.
是,晚辈记下了！¤Yes, the junior took it down!
说着，他拿出了一大块红棕色的琥珀，其中藏着一根大得夸张的羽毛——整体看就像一柄金灿灿地单锋剑，细看之下，一根根羽片都如松针一般，的确不似凡物。¤As he spoke, he took out a large piece of reddish-brown amber, with an exaggeratedly large feather hidden in it—the whole looked like a golden single-edged sword, and upon closer inspection, the feathers were like a feather. Like pine needles, it is indeed not like ordinary things.
太贵了，我最多出...¤It's too expensive, I'll spend the most...
可惜我并没有那么多灵石…¤Too bad I don't have that many spirit stones...
这价格我接受不了，最低...最低也得要六千灵石！¤I can't accept this price, the lowest...the lowest price is 6,000 spirit stones!
道友请留步！¤Fellow Daoist, please stay!
……一万灵石，只能作装饰，你怎么不去抢？¤... 10,000 spirit stones can only be used for decoration, why don't you grab them?
咳咳，是这样的，我是蓬莎岛的商人，遇到了致命的海上乱流，货物几乎全部都丢了，就只有这个我一直贴身保存……¤Ahem, it's like this, I am a businessman from Pongsha Island. I encountered a fatal sea turbulence, and almost all the goods were lost, and this is the only one I have always kept close to me...
就暂且相信你一回。¤Just trust you for a while.
这可是古代神兽别的羽毛，怎么可能仅作装饰？就算你转手卖出去，也不见得只能卖这么点…¤This is another feather of the ancient beast, how could it be just for decoration? Even if you resell it, it's not necessarily that you can only sell so much...
一千灵石！道友莫非是在拿我寻开心？¤A thousand spirit stones! Is my fellow Taoist making fun of me?
这...八千便八千吧，若非我急着用钱，可不会这样贱卖给道友。¤It's eight thousand for eight thousand. If I hadn't been in a hurry to spend the money, I wouldn't have sold it to fellow Daoists so cheaply.
可惜…我再去找别人吧…¤It's a pity... I'll go find someone else...
我对这种东西没有兴趣，道友还是另寻他人吧。¤I'm not interested in this kind of thing, so you should find someone else.
怎么样，这可是远古神兽鲲鹏的羽毛，虽然只是化石，但单做装饰用也是非常气派了。现在我急需用钱，就便宜你一回。一万灵石，这块化石便是你的了。¤Well, this is the feather of the ancient divine beast Kunpeng. Although it is just a fossil, it is very stylish for decoration alone. Now I need money urgently, so I'll give you a discount. Ten thousand spirit stones, this fossil is yours.
那便多谢道友了！¤Then thank you buddy!
这...五千便五千吧，若非我急着用钱，可不会这样贱卖给道友。¤This... Five thousand is five thousand. If I hadn't been in a hurry to spend the money, I wouldn't have sold it to fellow Daoists so cheaply.
我派的开山祖师金虹剑仙，实则是昔日九州飞升的第一人。可惜如今...¤The Golden Rainbow Sword Immortal, the founding master of our sect, was in fact the first person to ascend in Kyushu in the past. Unfortunately, nowadays...
千绝天赋异禀，若是能耐下性子来修炼，将来成就不可限量。¤Thousand Jue is talented, if he can endure his temperament to cultivate, his future achievements will be limitless.
原来阁下竟是少主的旧识，今日少主并未到坊市来，想来或许是在城中其他地方歇憩。¤It turns out that you are the old acquaintance of the young master. Today, the young master did not come to Fangshi. I thought that he might have a rest in other places in the city.
不知你们少主现今去了何处，听管家说他也跟随商队来了蓬莎岛，但我却没看见他的身影。¤I don't know where your Young Master has gone now. I heard the butler said that he also followed the caravan to Pongsha Island, but I didn't see him.
人类...你,,,你竟敢毁我大阵！¤Human... You,,, you dare to destroy my great Array!
你对于阵道一窍不通，虽然猜测此处可能布下了阵法，但还是一头雾水，不知要从何处下手调查。¤You do not know anything about the Array, although guessed that here may have laid a Array, but still confused, do not know where to start to investigate.
这里应当是{$Var}阵...¤This should be the {$Var} Array...
你虽对于阵法一道有所涉猎，但眼前这处阵法的玄妙复杂却远超你的想象。¤The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on a few things.
像这样的四象阵法一般都是由四处阵法组成。东面的青龙阵，北面的是玄武阵，西面的白虎阵和南面的朱雀阵...¤The four elephants Array like this is generally composed of four Arrays. The Green Dragon Array in the east, the Black Tortoise Array in the north, the White Tiger Array in the west and the Vermilion Bird Array in the south...
灵纹...难道是阵法么？¤Spiritual patterns... Could it be a Array?
好，成了！¤Okay, it's done!
一番尝试后，你最终确认，仅凭目前对阵道的感悟，是绝不可能破除这座大阵的。¤After some attempts, you finally confirmed that with only the current perception of the Dao of the Array, it is by no means possible to break this great Array.
灵纹...还有这异样的灵力波动...是四象聚灵阵？¤Spiritual pattern... And this strange spiritual power fluctuation... Is it the Four Elephant Spirit Gathering Array?
只需任意破除其中一个小阵，便可使大阵的作用大幅降低。但唯有找到大阵的阵眼藏在哪一处小阵之中，才能{color=#d0380a}一次{/color}将整座大阵破除。¤Just break any one of the small Arrays, the effect of the big Array can be significantly reduced. But the only way to {color=#d0380a} break the whole array at once {/color} is to find out where the array eye of the array is hidden in one of the small arrays.
这布阵手法我竟从未见过...想必这九幽数千年来也是有所{color=#d0380a}奇遇{/color}，不知从哪里得来的上古传承...¤I've never seen this formation technique before... I must have had some {color=#d0380a}adventurous encounters{/color} over the thousands of years in the Nine Serenities. I don't know where I got the ancient inheritance...
灵纹的光芒黯淡下来，整个海底洞窟开始剧烈抖动起来，无数黑色的烟雾从各处缝隙中涌现，几息之间便将你笼罩在其中。¤The light of the spirit pattern dimmed down, the whole underwater cave began to shake violently, countless black smoke from various crevices emerged, a few breaths will envelop you in it.
能够在海底布下达到宗门规格的聚灵大阵，看来这九幽大圣对于布阵的造诣颇深啊。¤It seems that the nine secluded great sages have a deep understanding of the formation of the spirit gathering array that can reach the specifications of the sect under the seabed.
你想上前阻拦，那幡便分出几束灵魂来阻挡你。顷刻间，万魂幡便提前完成了祭炼，一股化神强度的威压袭面而来。¤You want to go forward to block, the streamer will split out several beams of souls to block you. In a few moments, the streamer completed the sacrifice ahead of time, and a pressure of Deity Transformation came to the face.
倒是你不由分说便对我出手，又作何解释？¤But you did not say anything to me, how to explain?
见你并没有罢手的意思，她身形暴退，迅速吃下几颗丹药，随即将之前使用的那把幡祭出，其中灵魂朝万魂幡倾泻而出。¤Seeing that you have no intention of stopping, she retreated, quickly took a few pills, and then sacrificed the streamer she used before, in which her soul poured out towards the Ten Thousand Souls streamer.
既然双方皆有不义，此事便到此为止，道友请回罢。¤Since there is injustice on both sides, this is the end of the matter, so please go back.
你眼看不是我的对手，便想就这么算了？¤You see that you are not my opponent, so you want to just let it go?
那这万魂幡要如何招来你师妹元神？¤Then how is this 10,000 souls streamer going to recruit your senior sister's genesis?
你师妹是何人？¤Who is your senior sister?
此邪器就算再重要，终究也是为自己所用。¤This evil weapon, even if it is important, is ultimately for your own use.
此事说出去旁人也未必会信。放心，本座绝不向外人透露半个字。¤No one would believe me if I told them about this. Don't worry, I will never reveal a word of this to outsiders.
看来她无论如何也是不肯交出这万魂幡了...¤It seems that she refused to hand over this Ten Thousand Souls Streamer no matter what...
罢了。这下半部分名为十阎归魂诀，万魂幡便是其中提到的必备之物。¤That's all. The second half of this is called the Ten Yan Returning Souls Skill, and the Ten Thousand Souls Streamer is a necessary item mentioned therein.
你将阴魂岛上的事情大致同她描述了一遍。半晌，她竟说不出一句话来。¤You described to her what happened on the Island of the Underworld in general. For a long time, she could not say a word.
自然是受到了牵连，才被迫出手。¤Naturally, they were implicated and only then were they forced to take action.
前辈有所误会，这万魂幡里共有九千五百二十八魂，没有一个是靠杀戮得来的无辜冤魂。¤There is a misunderstanding, there are 9,528 souls in this banner, none of them are innocent souls who have been killed.
她眉头紧皱，咬紧牙关，似乎在做一个艰难的决定。¤She frowned and clenched her teeth, as if making a difficult decision.
若同时掌握上下两个部分，传言能够凭空复活往生之人。¤If you master the upper and lower parts at the same time, it is rumored to be able to resurrect the deceased out of thin air.
那在下便在此等候前辈归来了。¤Then I will wait here for the seniors to return.
罢了，前辈并未见过她，想必也不能理解吧。¤It's just that the seniors have not met her, so I'm sure they can't understand.
其实我此次前来，主要是受人之托，解决玄冥海魂体失踪一事。¤In fact, I came here, is mainly entrusted by someone to solve the matter of the disappearance of the soul body of the XuanMei sea.
罢了，既然你不肯交出万魂幡，本座便不逼你了。¤It's just that, since you refuse to hand over the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, this seat will not force you.
…你帮阴冥海上那些魂体做事？他们许给你什么好处？¤...you work for those souls on the Underworld Sea? What benefits did they promise you?
此言倒在你的意料之外。¤That's not what you'd expect.
我若真能得到此物，借你一阅又有何妨。¤If I can really get this object, what's the harm in lending it to you.
上半部分可助飘荡之元神重铸肉身，下半部分可助空洞之肉身召回元神。¤The upper part can help the drifting Yuan Shen to recast the flesh, and the lower part can help the hollow flesh to recall the Yuan Shen.
你若愿意帮我，我万魂殿愿出双倍好处。¤If you are willing to help me, I am willing to pay double the benefits of the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls.
“算了，此事不问也罢……“¤Forget it, this matter is not asked ......
这是自然，我们虽然修鬼魂类功法，但大多都是在战场上搜集而来，绝不会滥杀无辜。¤This is natural, although we practice ghost-like techniques, but most of them are collected on the battlefield, and will never kill the innocent.
以你所修炼功法，应该不难看出剑中也寄宿着一位魂体吧？¤With your training techniques, it should not be difficult to see that the sword also hosts a soul body, right?
多说无益，有什么底牌，直接亮出来罢。¤The most important thing is that you have to be able to see the bottom of the card.
倒是有点能耐。¤It's a little bit powerful.
不过还有一事本座有些兴趣，你之前提到的上半部分，莫非叫做逆天造化术？¤But there is one more thing that interests me. The upper part you mentioned before, could it be called the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique?
只可惜……上半部分在万年前便被奸人所盗，下落不明。¤It is a pity that the upper part of ...... was stolen by a traitor ten thousand years ago and its whereabouts are unknown.
那要如何复生？¤How is that going to be resurrected?
听到这个问题，她低下了头，目光也不再直视你。¤Hearing this question, she lowered her head, and her eyes no longer look directly at you.
她低下头，面色阴沉了起来。¤She lowered her head and her face clouded.
如此匪夷所思之事，你若说不出个所以然来，要本座如何信得过你？¤How can I trust you if you can't tell me the truth about such an unbelievable thing?
但这十阎归魂诀却能以肉身为锚点，从万魂幡内寻找与其相似的元神碎片，重新拼凑出一个类似的元神。¤But this Ten Yan Returning Soul Technique can use the flesh as an anchor point to find the fragments of a similar spirit from the Ten Thousand Soul Streamers and put together a similar spirit again.
你要救谁与我何关，我也有那不得不救之人。¤Who do you want to save and what I have to do, I also have that have to save the person.
我万魂殿至高法门便是这复活之法，分为上下两个部分。¤The highest method of my hall of ten thousand souls is this method of resurrection, divided into two parts.
而且我祭炼此幡，根本不是为自己所用，而是想复活我的师妹。¤And I sacrificed this streamer, not for my own use at all, but to resurrect my senior sister.
据教史记载，以此法拼凑出的元神，无论是性格、喜好、善恶，都与本人几乎没有区别。¤According to the history of the religion, the spirit put together by this method is almost indistinguishable from oneself in terms of personality, preferences, good and evil.
你想上前阻止，却遭到之前两个带路喽啰的阻拦。¤You try to step forward to stop it, but are stopped by the two minions who led the way before you.
前辈，你若得到了这逆天造化术，可否借我一阅？我愿用全部家当作为交换。¤Senior, if you have obtained this Heavenly Creation Technique, can you lend me a copy? I am willing to give all my family's belongings in exchange.
……你先发誓不向外人透露此事。¤...... you first swear not to disclose this matter to outsiders.
她……肉身也不在了……¤Her ...... flesh is also gone ......
你的好意我心领了，只是他们许的好处无可替代，你还是莫要打这些心思为好。¤I appreciate your good intentions, but they promised irreplaceable benefits, you should not fight these thoughts better.
道友，你若得到了这逆天造化术，可否借我一阅？当然，好处定然少不了。¤Fellow Daoist, if you get this heaven-reversing creation technique, can you lend me a read? Of course, the benefits will certainly be few.
这…真不知当从何说起…¤This...really don't know when to start...
道友，此事涉及到我万魂殿最高机密，还请莫要过问。¤Fellow Daoist, this matter involves the highest secrets of my Ten Thousand Souls Hall, please do not ask questions.
”……这样拼凑出来的东西，还能算是复活嘛？“¤...... Can something cobbled together like this still be considered a resurrection?
前辈，此事涉及到我万魂殿最高机密，还是莫要过问为好。¤Senior, this matter involves the highest secrets of my Hall of Ten Thousand Souls, so it is better not to ask about it.
听到这个问题，她顿时警觉了起来。¤Hearing this question, she was instantly alerted.
既然你不肯交出万魂幡，那多说无益，有什么底牌，直接亮出来罢。¤Since you refuse to hand over the Ten Thousand Souls Streamer, it is useless to talk more, what is the bottom card, directly light up strike.
我万魂殿与阁下无冤无仇，阁下何故与我们为敌？¤I have no grudge against you, so why are you an enemy of us?
一般来说，元神若是消散了，便是永远消散了，再无召回的说法。¤Generally speaking, if the genesis is dissipated, it is dissipated forever, and there is no more recall.
不过还有一事令我十分在意，你之前提到的上半部分，莫非叫做逆天造化术？¤But there is another thing that concerns me a lot, the upper part you mentioned before, could it be called the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique?
只见她面色愈加阴沉起来。¤I just saw her face become more and more gloomy.
唯有此事，我断然不会答应。你可知道这万魂幡对我来说有多重要？¤The only thing that I will definitely not agree to is this matter. Do you know how important this Ten Thousand Souls Streamer is to me?
就算不能复生，只招来元神，我也心满意足了。¤Even if I can't be reborn, I'll be satisfied with only the original spirit.
本座若真能得到此物，借你一阅又有何妨。¤If I can really get it, what's the harm in lending it to you?
此前与我一辈的颜师兄，就因为被发现其擅自杀人夺魂，而被殿主逐出了万魂殿。¤Previously with my generation of senior brother Yan, because he was found to kill without permission to take the soul, and was expelled from the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls.
唯有此事，在下断然不会答应。前辈可知这万魂幡对在下有多重要？¤The only thing I will not agree to is this. Does senior know how important this Ten Thousand Souls Banner is to me?
虽然两三下便解决了杂兵，可大长老的万魂幡已经提前祭炼完毕，所释放出的威压连你也小觑不得。¤Although the miscellaneous soldiers were settled in two or three strokes, the Grand Elder's Ten Thousand Souls Banner has been refined in advance, and the pressure released cannot be underestimated even by you.
你有复活之法？¤You have the law of resurrection?
罢了，你一介外人，想必也不能理解吧。¤It's just that you are an outsider, I'm sure you can't understand it.
不必多言，出手罢。¤No need for words, Come at me!.
这么说，你师妹肉身尚在？¤So, your sister's flesh is still alive?
你……你根本什么都不知道。¤You ...... you simply don't know anything.
那我便在这里等候道友了。¤Then I will wait for you here.
此事说出去旁人也未必会信。放心，我绝不向外人透露半个字。¤This matter is said out the side may not believe. Don't worry, I will never reveal half a word to outsiders.
如此匪夷所思之事，你若说不出个所以然来，要我如何信得过你？¤Such an incredible thing, if you can not say a reason, how can I trust you?
阁下并非魂体，又如何受到牵连？¤You are not a soul body, how can you be implicated?
这么说，你们万魂殿从不滥杀无辜，倒像个名门正派？¤So, your Hall of Souls never kills innocent people, but like a famous sect?
见你没有罢手的意思，她身形暴退，迅速吃下几颗丹药，随即将一杆小幡祭出，其中灵魂朝万魂幡倾泻而出。¤Seeing that you have no intention of stopping, she storms back, quickly takes a few pills, and then offers up a small streamer in which her soul pours out towards the Ten Thousand Souls Banner.
也不知道，你为了祭炼此幡，究竟牺牲了多少无辜冤魂。¤I also wonder how many innocent souls you have sacrificed in order to sacrifice this banner.
…前辈若发誓不向别人透露……¤...seniors if they swear not to reveal it to others ......
你怎会知道？¤How would you know?
如若你交出万魂幡，离开玄冥海，你我便不用大动干戈了，如何？¤If you hand over the Ten Thousand Souls Streamer and leave the Mystic Dao Sea, you and I won't have to make a big fuss, how about that?
我与师妹从小情同手足，一起修炼了几百年，怎想到……¤My sister and I grew up thick as thieves, and cultivated together for hundreds of years, who could have thought ......
我这万魂幡里共有九千五百二十八魂，没有一个是靠杀戮得来的无辜冤魂。¤I have a total of nine thousand five hundred and twenty-eight souls in this ten thousand souls banner, none of them are innocent and wrongful souls obtained by killing.
而且在下祭炼此幡，根本不是为自己所用，而是想复活师妹。¤And I did not sacrifice this banner for my own use at all, but to resurrect my sister.
就算事出有因，你杀我教众，我又岂能坐视不理？¤Even if there is a reason, you killed my congregation, how can I sit back and watch?
罢了，既然你不肯交出万魂幡，我便不逼你了。¤That's all, since you refuse to hand over the Ten Thousand Souls Streamer, I won't force you.
前辈怎会知道？¤How do you know?
她极为生气，整个人都在微微颤抖。¤She was extremely angry and her whole body was trembling slightly.
不过是为自己屠戮生灵找些理由罢了，本座可不吃这套。¤Just looking for some justification for your slaughter of living beings, this seat does not eat that.
如今，我所能掌握的只有下半部分而已。¤Today, all I can grasp is just the second half.
玄伶仙子管辖{color=#d0380a}剑派{/color}，是掌门的亲传弟子。虽然年轻但修为不逊于另两位长老，她主修的《乾坤化剑诀》也是我派秘传功法。¤Lady Starsong governs {color=#d0380a}Sword Sect{/color}, and is a direct disciple of the head. Although young, her cultivation is not inferior to the other two elders. She majored in Sword Art from Universe is also my school. Secret exercises.
我派目前还有授业的有三位长老，分别是润熹，凝霜和玄伶三位前辈，你想了解哪一位？¤There are three elders in my school who are still teaching, namely Runxi, Ningshuang and Xuanling. Which one do you want to know about?
凝霜仙子为{color=#d0380a}冰{/color}派长老，虽性格急躁了些，但主修《裂冰诀》的她操控冰的能力宁州无人能出其右。¤Lady Frostglaze is an elder of the {color=#d0380a}Ice{/color} sect. Although her personality is a little irritable, no one in Ning Province can match her ability to control ice, who majored in 《 Ice Breaking Art 》.
润熹仙子有金丹后期修为，其独门功法《水灵妙法》能活用{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}之力，一经施展便是连绵不断的攻势，极难防备。¤Lady Dawnrain is at the late Golden Core stage, and her unique cultivation method 《 Aqua Spiritual Method 》can make full use of {color=#d0380a}the Elemental Cycle{/color}. Once it starts, it will be a stream of continuous offense; which is extremely difficult to guard against.
大师兄，既然内鬼已除，我想打听一下墨师兄的下落。¤Eldest Brother, since the spy has been removed, I would like to inquire about the whereabouts of Brother Mo.
炎萧扭头看了你一眼，将手中的重尺停下，向你走来。¤Yan Xiao turned his head and glanced at you, stopped the heavy ruler in his hand, and walked towards you.
（五灵根，资质这么差...）¤(Five Linggen, so poor qualifications...)
就在你快要坚持不住的时候，炎萧终于放下手中的重尺，向你走来。¤Just when you were about to be unable to hold on, Yan Xiao finally put down the heavy ruler in his hand and walked towards you.
嘿！哈！嘿！哈！¤Hey! Ha! Hey! Ha!
你未曾修炼我们离火门的功法，以炼气期的修为可以坚持来到这里，就已经算通过了入门的第一道考验。¤You haven't practiced our Heavenly Fire Gate techniques, and you can insist on coming here with the cultivation base of the Qi refining period, and you have already passed the first test of entry.
炎麟大圣本是化神期妖圣，乃当年本门魔焰真君的至交好友，受其邀请加入我离火门。¤The Great Sage Yan Lin was a Demon Saint at the Deity Transformation stage, and was a close friend of our Demon Flame Sovereign, and was invited by him to join the Heavenly Fire Gate.
大师兄正在练剑，我还是不要打扰他了...¤Big brother is practicing sword, we shouldn't disturb him...
你没有出声，而是站到一边静静地等待。没过多久，你便被这里的高温热得头晕脑胀，只能咬牙坚持...¤You didn't make a sound, but stood aside and waited quietly. It didn't take long for you to be dizzy by the heat here, and you can only grit your teeth and insist...
（三灵根，资质还算不错....）¤(Sanlinggen, the qualifications are pretty good...)
这灵核这是各大门派争夺的一种重要资源，我们离火门也不例外。所以你收集到的所有灵核都可以在宗门内部换取其它你需要的东西。¤This spiritual core is an important resource that various sects compete for, and we are no exception from the Heavenly Fire Gate. So all the spiritual cores you collect can be exchanged for other things you need inside the sect.
大师兄，我是新入门的外门弟子，{FirstName}{LastName}¤Big brother, I am a new beginner outside disciple, {FirstName}{LastName}
不错{shidi}，看来你已经领取了功法与符器。¤Yes {shidi}, it seems that you have already received the exercises and talisman.
所以，他已经被废去修为，逐出师门了。¤So, he has been abolished and expelled from the division.
你未来一段时间的住所我会找人替你安排妥当，你先去{color=#d0380a}神兵阁{/color}领取外门弟子配属的符器与道袍，再去{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}挑选入门功法，之后再回来找我。¤I will find someone to make arrangements for your residence for a period of time in the future. You can go to {color=#d0380a}Shenbing Pavilion{/color} to receive the talisman and robes attached to the outer disciples, and then go to {color=#d0380a }The Tibetan Scripture Pavilion{/color} choose an introductory exercise, and come back to me later.
把手伸过来。¤Stretch your hand over.
老墨啊....¤Old Mo...
还有件重要的事情你须得记住，我派每30年会举办一次{color=#d0380a}宗门大比{/color}，所有练气期的弟子都可以参与。¤There is one more important thing you must remember, every 30 years our sect will hold a {color=#d0380a}clan competition{/color} in which all Qi training stage disciples can participate.
虽然我们离火门在这次试炼中位列魁首，但却有两位师弟在魔物的手下丧了命。¤Although we Heavenly Fire Gate ranked first in this trial, two juniors were killed by the monsters.
{FirstName}{shidi}，想必刚刚已经有人和你说过了，相比资质与悟性，我们离火门更看重你的心性与品行。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, I think someone has already told you just now. Compared with aptitude and understanding, we value your character and character more at Heavenly Fire Gate.
你先去{color=#d0380a}神兵阁{/color}领取外门弟子配属的符器与道袍，再去{color=#d0380a}藏经阁{/color}挑选入门功法，之后再回来找我。¤You first go to the {color=#d0380a}Shenbing Pavilion{/color} to receive the talisman and robes attached to the outer disciples, and then go to {color=#d0380a}Zangjing Pavilion{/color} to select the entry technique, and then Come back to me.
（这墨居仁本就受魔焰决困扰，再加上这一番折腾也没几年好活了。）¤(This Mo Juren was already troubled by the Demon Flame Decision, and after all this tossing, it didn't take a few years for him to live well.)
至于未来能不能成为内门弟子，还得要看你自己的努力。¤As for whether you can become an inner disciple in the future, it depends on your own efforts.
此次能战胜地魔你功不可没，不愧是我离火门弟子！¤This time you can fight against the demon, you are indispensable, you deserve to be disciple of my Heavenly Fire Gate!
（竟...竟然和我一样，是天灵根！）¤(Actually...like me, it is the root of heaven!)
他拉过你的手，伸出两根手指，搭住了你的脉门...¤He took your hand, stretched out two fingers, and covered your veins...
你叫什么名字？¤What's your name?
我虽然极力求情，但老墨已经魔种深种，必须要废去修为才能根除。¤Although I tried my best to beg for mercy, Lao Mo has a deep seed of devil and must be abolished in order to get rid of it.
（双灵根，资质还算不错....）¤(Shuanglinggen, the qualifications are pretty good...)
这筑基丹就算在门派内也非常稀有，但它对于你们未来的筑基非常的重要，师兄我当年也是服用了两颗筑基丹才筑基成功的，{shidi}可要好好抓住这样的机会啊。¤This Foundation Pill is very rare even in the sect, but it is very important for your future breakthrough. Even I had to take two Foundation Pills to reach Foundation Establishment. {shidi} should be seized such a rare opportunity.
对了，入我离火门，还有些事宜需要注意。¤By the way, there are still some matters that need to be taken care of when you join my Heavenly Fire Gate.
（四灵根，资质倒是一般...）¤(Silinggen, the qualifications are average...)
我叫{FirstName}{LastName}¤My name is {FirstName}{LastName}
后山麟庙乃是宗门老祖炎麟大圣闭关之地，平日里有绝焰堂弟子驻守，{shidi}如无必要还是不要乱转。¤The back mountain Lin Temple is the place where the clan's ancestor, the Great Sage Yan Lin, is in seclusion, and is normally guarded by Absolute Flame Hall disciples, so {shidi} it's better not to wander around if not necessary.
炎萧正奋力挥舞一把黑色的大尺修炼着，似乎并没有注意到你的到来。¤Yan Xiao is struggling to wield a black large ruler for cultivation, and it seems that he didn't notice your arrival.
多谢{FirstName}{gongzi}。我手中正有一块千年寒玉，若是香薷畏寒恰巧可派上用场。择日不如撞日，我俩便即刻启程吧。¤Thank you {FirstName}{gongzi}. I have a thousand-year-old cold jade in my hand. If it's a chill, it will come in handy. If you choose a day, it's better to hit the sun. Let's set off right away.
太好了，这下师妹有救了！¤Great, now Junior Sister is saved!
我们出发吧！¤Let's go!
其物名唤宁州香薷，因及其畏寒生于火铜四周...但早在五百年前就已经灭绝了。¤Its name is Ning Province Xiangluo, because it was born around the fire copper because of its chills...but it was extinct as early as five hundred years ago.
那古迹中并未提及他法......{FirstName}{gongzi}，我思前想后，还是打算去沃焦山一探究竟。¤There is no mention of other methods in the monuments...{FirstName}{gongzi}, after thinking about it, I still plan to go to Inferno Mountain to find out.
等等、等等！你这人也太过性急，还有后半句没说呢！¤Wait, wait! You are too impatient, and I haven't said the second half!
{FirstName}{gongzi}，多谢你仗义相助，师妹的事就由我自己来吧。¤{FirstName}{gongzi}, thank you for your righteous help. I will take care of the younger sister’s affairs.
{vpunch=10,0.5}灭绝......？¤{vpunch=10,0.5} extinct......?
{vpunch=10,0.5}五百年前就已经灭绝了......？¤{vpunch=10,0.5} was extinct five hundred years ago...?
听了你的话，李相书脸上的血色逐渐褪去，面色惶惶地看着你嗫嚅道。¤After listening to your words, the blood on Li Xiangshu's face gradually faded, and he looked at you with a panic expression.
哪怕只有一丝机会我也想赌上一赌，俗话说眼见为实，不自己查探一番实在不能算是尽人事。¤I want to make a bet even if I only have a chance. As the saying goes, seeing is believing, and it's impossible to do everything without investigating it myself.
道友可觅得草药的消息了？¤Fellow Dao can find news about herbs?
消息是有了......¤The news is...
你还真是不到黄河心不死......¤You really won't die until the Yellow River...
他魂不守舍地翻来覆去念叨这一句，你摇了摇头轻声叹息。¤He kept chanting this sentence over and over again, you shook your head and sighed softly.
到了这里应该差不多了。¤It should be almost done here.
前方应该就是入口，我们进去一探。¤The entrance should be right in front. Let's go in and explore.
你和倪旭欣在逸风城近郊停下脚步，此处树木丛生，杂草旺盛。但不知为何十几丈外的土地草木凋零，显得十分荒芜怪异。¤You and Ni XuXin stopped in the outskirts of Yifeng City, where trees are overgrown and weeds are thriving. But for some reason, the land more than ten meters away is withered and looks very barren and weird.
前阵听闻逸风城附近的龙隐洞有妖兽作祟，残害无辜百姓。没想到地图的终点居然是此处，算了算了，就当为民除害吧！¤In the front, I heard that there are monsters in Longyin Cave near Yifeng City, killing innocent people. I didn't expect the end of the map to be here. Forget it, just take it for the people!
自上古之后我龙族遗失大量秘法，目前族中已经没有适合道友的术法了。¤Since ancient times, my dragon clan has lost a lot of secret techniques, and currently there is no magic technique suitable for daoists in the clan.
陨龙之地中出现的上古遗物，就包括我龙族的传功龙鳞。¤The ancient relics that appeared in the land of the falling dragon include the dragon scales of my dragon family.
道友寻回的传功龙鳞我已经提取了其中内容。¤I have extracted the contents of the Dragon Scales of Inheritance that Daoists found.
愿闻其详，还请赐教。¤I would like to hear more about this and would be grateful for your advice.
不敢不敢，这《金鳞草集》乃是我龙族先辈所著，其上记载了不少我龙族特产的天才地宝，这就赠与道友吧。¤I dare not, this Golden Scaled Herb Collection is written by the ancestors of my dragon clan, and it contains a lot of genius and geological treasures that are special to my dragon clan, so I will give it to you.
你救出敖玄的陨龙之地，可惜并没有遇到传功龙鳞，道友只能等下次机会了。¤You rescued Ao Xuan's Falling Dragon Land, but unfortunately you didn't encounter the Dragon Scales, so fellow Daoists can only wait for the next chance.
道友可曾听闻过我龙族的各种天材地宝？¤Have you ever heard of the various heavenly treasures of my Dragon Clan?
不过，听闻东海有人在{color=#d0380a}东海陨龙之地{/color}之中寻得过我龙族的传功龙鳞。¤However, I heard that someone in the East China Sea found the dragon scales of my dragon family in the {color=#d0380a}East China Sea Dragon Land{/color}.
上古龙宫虽是沉没于东海海底，但龙宫的残垣断壁每隔百年会上浮至海面。¤Although the Ancient Dragon Palace sank at the bottom of the East China Sea, the ruins of the Dragon Palace surfaced to the sea every hundred years.
多谢长老。¤Many thanks, Senior.
嘿嘿，就是想想么。¤Hey, just think about it.
看着台下的魁首，你似乎想起了自己当年也如同他一般，心中颇有感慨。¤Looking at the chief on the stage, you seem to recall that you were just like him back then, and you feel quite emotional.
你看到下方弟子都在按步骤进行，虽有人很是吃力但也没有意外发生。¤You see that the disciples below are following the steps, and although some are struggling there are no accidents.
啊！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Ah!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
数轮比赛之后决出了本届魁首，他虽是负伤在身却也难掩自己的激动。¤After several rounds of competition, the current leader was decided and he could not hide his excitement even though he was injured.
也不知我什么时候才能像{FirstName}长老一样成为金丹长老呢。¤And I wonder when I will become a Golden Dan Elder like the {FirstName} Elders.
在台下众弟子憧憬的注视下你转身离开。¤You turn to leave under the longing eyes of the disciples on the stage.
你呀就是好高骛远，我们能不能从这外门大比之中杀出来都不知道呢。¤You're overly ambitious. We don't even know if we'll be able to make it out of the Great Outer Sect Competition.
你是指？¤You mean?
之后他被带往大殿拜师，你也在台下众弟子憧憬的注视下起身离开。¤After that he was taken to the main hall to pay his respects, and you got up and left under the longing eyes of the disciples on the stage.
宗门广场上聚集了不少外门弟子，算算时间此时正是外门大比的日子。¤Many outer disciples were gathered in the sect square, counting the time this was the day of the outer sect competition.
远处已经有宗门长老开始组织众弟子，不过见你到场他向你走来。¤In the distance there are already clan elders who have begun to organise the crowd of disciples, but seeing you arrive he comes towards you.
这位{FirstName}长老，当年不仅夺得外门大比魁首进入内门，之后更是一举突破至金丹期成为长老。¤This {FirstName} elder, not only won the top spot in the Outer Sect Competition to enter the Inner Sect, but also broke through to the Golden Dan stage to become an elder afterwards.
台下弟子多数还在融化材料，他们其中有人得心应手也有的手忙脚乱。¤Most of the disciples on the stage were still melting the materials, some of them with ease and others with fumbling hands.
此时两名弟子的低语传入你耳。¤At this point the whispers of two disciples reach your ears.
{FirstName}长老，可有兴致旁观本届大比？¤Elder {FirstName}, are you interested in watching this year's competition?
一会儿加油~我先走了¤Cheers later~ I'll be off
我辈修士本就是逆天而行，若连这点心气儿都没有，还怎么求得长生大道？¤If we cultivators do not even have the heart to do so, how can we seek to attain the path of eternal life?
长...长老？¤El... Elder?
一会儿加油~¤Cheers later~
这位就是{FirstName}长老吧？¤This is the {FirstName} elder, right?
你正欲转身离开，此时两名弟子的低语传入你耳。¤You are about to turn away, when the whispers of two disciples reach your ears.
嗯，品相不错。¤Well, quality is not bad.
看到你在傍边落座，明显很多弟子显得跃跃欲试想在你面前表现一番。¤Seeing you take your seat in the evening, it was clear that many of the disciples appeared eager to perform in front of you.
黑点即将消失在你眼前时，也不知星铃儿是发现你在努力追上她还是怎的，竟停在半空等你。见状你也是连忙赶过去。¤Right as the black spot is going to disappear from your vision, it stops. You aren't sure if Star Bell noticed you and let you catch up or not. You hurry over.
星道友呢？为何在此停下？¤What about you, Daoist Star? Why stop here?
咳...没想到星姑娘在遁术上竟会如此厉害，让我险些追不上。¤Cough... I didn't expect you to be so fast with your transportation technique, so much so that I could barely catch up.
原来如此。我作为正派修士，对妖人邪道等也是深恶痛绝，若是星姑娘不介意，请让我与道友一同前去剿灭妖人，如何？¤I see, as a decent cultivator I also detest evil cultivators, if miss Star doesn't mind, how about we go exterminate them together?
竟然以星道友的速度都没能追上？难道那妖人是筑基？¤Ah? You can't catch up with even fellow Daoist Star's speed? Could it be the evil cultivator is in the Golden Core Realm?
那星道友停下，是因为他躲在这附近？¤Ah? So you stopped because he hid around here?
没有啊，让他跑了。¤No, I let him run away.
嗯，是你...好像是叫...哦，是上次那个坏我事的对吧？¤Oh? It's you! You are... Oh! The one who screwed up my mission last time, right?
只是想说上次星道友送我的冰灵面纱很好用，多谢星道友，哈...哈哈。¤I just wanted to tell you that the Ice Spirit Veil you gave me last time was very useful, thank you my friend. Ha... haha...
嗯...既然你有此兴致，便随我一同前往吧。¤Hm... Since you're up for it, follow me.
刚才我发现印记已在前方不远处停滞，估摸着是快到他洞府之类的落脚处了，于是想着慢慢走过去就停下来咯。¤Just now, I found that he stopped moving through the imprint around here. I guessed he was about to enter his hideout so I sped up.
竟然以星道友的速度都没能追上？难道那妖人是金丹期？¤Ah? You can't catch up with even fellow Daoist Star's speed? Could it be the evil cultivator is in the Golden Core Realm?
星姑娘。¤star girl.
我看星道友行色匆匆，还以为遇到麻烦，想着助道友一臂之力就追上来了。¤I saw that you were in a hurry and thought you might be in trouble, so I caught up in case you needed a hand.
哦？你为何要追在我身后？¤Oh? Why are you chasing after me?
不知星道友有什么需要帮忙的么？¤I'm not sure if you need a hand still?
之前交战时，我顺手留下了神识印记，以他的修为想消除我的印记可没那么容易。¤When I wounded him, I left a Soul Sense mark on him, it's not so easy for him to remove with his cultivation.
嗯，告诉你也无妨。我本是奉师命于云汐城追查左近出现修习邪术的妖人一事，方才打伤其中一人后便一路追寻至此。¤Well, I guess I can tell you. I was originally instructed to hunt down some evil cultivators who were operating in Yun Shi city. I just wounded one of them before he fled to this place.
想啥呢，是我故意放跑他的，不然就算是金丹期也跑不了，哼哼，我可是很厉害的！¤What are you thinking? I said I let him go on purpose, otherwise even powerful Golden Core cultivators would not be able to run away.. Hmph.. I am very powerful!
哦，不用客气。¤Oh, you're welcome.
你将速度提升到最快，竟还只能看着那道身影渐渐化为一个黑点，还是一个越来越小乃至若隐若现的黑点。¤You increase your speed to the limit, but can only watch as she gets further and further away, eventually being reduced to nothing but a black dot in your vision.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}今日来找我何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} Why come to me today? {w}{w=0.5}
多亏{FirstName}{xiongdi}当日的开解，我百里一族才得以化解与龙族的怨恨！¤Thanks to the resolution of {FirstName}{xiongdi} that day, my Baili clan was able to resolve the resentment with the dragon clan!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}今日可是来找我切磋一番的？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} came to me for a discussion today?
索性父亲已经同意将龙珠归还于龙族，这才化解了多年的恩怨。¤Simply my father has agreed to return the Dragon Ball to the Dragon Clan, and this has resolved years of grievances.
噢？{FirstName}{xiongdi}也听到有关宁州古迹的传闻了？¤Oh? {FirstName}{xiongdi} also heard the rumors about the historic sites in Ning Province?
你问父亲？我们父子关系非常融洽，父亲对我的修练也很关心。但我总觉得，父亲好像有什么隐瞒着我一样。¤You ask my father? The relationship between our father and son is very harmonious, and my father is also very concerned about my practice. But I always feel that my father seems to be hiding something from me.
只有修得体道大成，才能在灵气乱流中自如来去，不受任何影响。我等待此次机遇已有百年时间，不过届时{FirstName}{xiongdi}还是要多加小心啊！¤Only by cultivating the dignity and Dao, can you come and go freely in the turbulent flow of spiritual energy, without being affected. I have been waiting for this opportunity for a hundred years, but {FirstName}{xiongdi} still have to be more careful by then!
等以后结丹了，定要再出海历练一番。¤When I have a pill formation in the future, I will definitely go to sea again for some practice.
看来{FirstName}{xiongdi}已经听说了，之前我贸然前往化龙海域，得罪了龙族，差点给广陵城的百姓带来灭顶之灾。¤It seems that {FirstName}{xiongdi} has already heard about it. Before, I rushed to the Dragonborn Sea to offend the Dragon Clan and almost brought annihilation to the people of Guangling City.
据族中长辈说，想要进入宁州古迹所在的位面，需得先通过{color=#d0380a}空间裂隙{/color}才行。而即使是元婴期修士也难以在这空间乱流中稳住身形，只能勉强跟随乱流前进，伺机寻找进入古位面的入口。¤According to the elders of the tribe, if you want to enter the plane where Ning Province’s historic sites are located, you must first pass through the {color=#d0380a}Space Rift{/color}. Even the cultivators of the Nascent Soul realm cannot be confused in this space. Steady body in the flow, can only reluctantly follow the turbulent flow, looking for an opportunity to find the entrance to the ancient plane.
我曾跟随家族的船队去过一次海，这海里的妖兽都极难对付，可惜当时的修为太低，也没帮上大家什么忙。¤I once went to the sea with the family fleet. The monsters in this sea were extremely difficult to deal with. Unfortunately, the cultivation base at that time was too low to help everyone.
可是新来的小{shidi}？我教所用法器较为特殊，这是能储存灵尘的葫芦。你聚集的尘可暂时储存在此物内，待战斗时一并放出。¤But the newcomer {shidi}? The magic weapon I taught is more special. This is a gourd that can store spiritual dust. The dust you gather can be temporarily stored in this thing, and will be released during battle.
{shidi}拿好，千万小心别弄丢了。¤{shidi} take it, be careful not to lose it.
没想到...我算来算去，甚至背叛了宗门，最后落得如此下场。早知如此，何必当初啊......¤Unexpectedly... I counted, even betrayed the sect, and ended up like this in the end. I knew this before, so why bother...
气眼中央，一位通体漆黑、发色雪白的“少女”本在闭目修炼。你闯入气眼后，她便也抬头看向了你。¤In the center of the eye, a 'young girl' with black body and snow-white hair was cultivating with her eyes closed. After you broke into the eye, she also looked up at you.
（邪魅地）我们诞生于极阴之地极阴之时，是天地间偶然的造化，山岳江河般的存在。¤(Evilly) We were born in the land of extreme yin at the time of extreme yin, a fortuitous creation of heaven and earth, the existence of mountains and rivers.
这么说，这只灵雀是铁下心一定要变成金鹏了？¤So, this spirit bird is determined to become a golden roc?
气旋内阴气浓郁地好像马上就要凝成液体一般，以至于让你根本感受不到灵气的流动。¤The actual fact is that you can't even feel the flow of aura.
原来是姑娘在此修炼，在下不慎闯入，多有得罪，还望姑娘海涵…¤So it is the girl here to cultivate, I accidentally intruded, many offenses, I hope you forgive me...
（腼腆地）唔…那还是听二姐的吧，抱歉啦~¤(Coyly) Well...then let's listen to the second sister, sorry~
（腼腆地）你…你好……¤(Coyly) You... hello ......
（冷静地）…结局虽然如此，但一只灵雀渴望变成金鹏，又有什么错呢？¤(Calmly) ... The ending is such, but what is wrong with a spirit bird aspiring to become a golden roc?
灵雀很伤心。但作为蓬莎岛上唯一一只会修炼的灵雀，它坚信一定会找到出路。¤The spirit sparrow was sad. But as the only spiritual finch that can cultivate on Pongsha Island, it firmly believes that it will find a way out.
没错，灵雀终究不是金鹏。¤That's right, the spirit bird is not a golden roc after all.
你能听出她语气中的决然，想来已是打定了主意。¤You can hear the determination in her tone, and you think she has already made up her mind.
此次机会若不抓住，你便又要枯坐修炼数万年，若你不觉得无聊，大可多给人家给几块。¤If you do not seize this opportunity, you will have to sit and cultivate for tens of thousands of years again, if you do not feel bored, you can give people to give a few more pieces.
（邪魅地）这可是我的最高杰作！¤(Evilly) This is my supreme masterpiece!
费尽千辛万苦学成之后，它的体型与实力都变得与寻常的金鹏一样，心想——这下金鹏们总能接纳自己了吧？¤After all the hard work, its body size and strength have become the same as the ordinary golden roc, thinking - now the golden roc can always accept themselves, right?
震惊带来的僵硬仅持续了一瞬间，你马上便回过了神来。¤The stiffness brought on by the shock lasted only a moment, and you immediately came back to your senses.
你本意只是想试探一二，但问完这句话后片刻的安静，却让你莫名有些后怕。¤You intended to just test a couple of things, but the quietness for a moment after asking this question made you inexplicably a little scared.
二姐？这里不是只有你一个人嘛？¤The second sister? The only person here is not you?
在你的一连串发问下，三妹逐渐占据了上风。你也意识到了情况的危急。¤Under your barrage of questions, the third sister gradually gains the upper hand. You also realize the critical nature of the situation.
如此，在下便先行告退了…¤I will leave now...
既然这些过程都能模拟，为何数万年还不飞升？¤If all these processes can be simulated, why haven't you soared in tens of thousands of years?
（邪魅地）嘁嘁嘁，还是你这{xiaozi}聪明啊，这么久都没有飞升的东西怎么会是人呢？¤(wickedly) Ch-ch-ch-ch, still you {xiaozi} are smart, how can something that hasn't soared for so long be a human being?
突如其来的呵斥打断了你，让你从这些问题中抽离了出来。¤The sudden rebuke interrupts you and takes you away from these questions.
“这…难道便是传说中的元神分裂？”¤Is this... is this the legendary splitting of the genesis?
（腼腆地）真的吗？荧儿上次听故事都不知道是多久之前了！¤(coyly) Really? I don't know how long it's been since I last heard a story from Flux!
（腼腆地）其实这个数万年指的是月环蚀的周期。¤(Coyly) Actually, this tens of thousands of years refers to the cycle of lunar eclipses.
后会有期！¤See you later!
这样想固然没错，但若这只灵雀始终不能变成金鹏，那么回归灵雀，感受灵雀的快乐，又何尝不可呢？¤It is certainly right to think so, but if this spirit bird can never turn into a golden roc, then why not return to the spirit bird and feel the joy of the spirit bird?
祭出非也给你的避阴珠，气旋内的阴气果然都离你而去，瞬间腾出了约莫三丈方圆的空间。¤Offer the Yin avoidance pearl that Feiya gave you, the Yin Qi within the cyclone really all left you, instantly freeing up a space of about three feet square.
听了二姐的话，你顿时语塞起来。¤Hearing the second sister's words, you are at a loss for words.
她究竟是怎么想到这一层的？你无论如何也想不通这一点。¤How on earth did she think of this layer? You can't figure this out no matter what.
（冷静地）嗯…但灵雀终究不是金鹏。这种关系，恐怕难以维系吧？¤(calmly) Well ... but the spirit bird is not the golden roc after all. This relationship, I'm afraid, is difficult to maintain, right?
一下子接受如此之多的信息，你的疑惑不减反增。¤Receiving so much information at once, your doubts increase rather than decrease.
你按魏无极所说的，小心翼翼地走到那山包前——那哪是什么山包，那赫然是一大堆神阴石。¤You did what Wei Wuji said and carefully walked to the mountain bag - it's not a mountain bag, it's a huge pile of divine Yin stones.
你不等她把话说完，转身便朝外飞去。不料她竟以一种非人的速度向你攻来，令你始料未及。¤You don't wait for her to finish her sentence, turn around and fly towards the outside. You were not expecting her to come at you with an inhuman speed, which took you by surprise.
但就是这小小的空间，使你原本紧张的情绪稍微得到了缓解。¤But it is this small space that makes your original tension slightly relieved.
老头，你觉得她能成功吗？¤Old man, do you think she can succeed?
随着时间的流逝，它们体型与实力上的差距越来越大，随之而来的问题也越来越多，灵雀最终还是被金鹏们排挤在外了。¤As time passes, the gap in their size and strength grows, and with it more and more problems, the spirit sparrows are eventually sidelined by the golden rooks.
若非也所说不错，气眼处只是一个重阴气的灵物罢了。¤If not also said good, gas eye at just a heavy Yin Qi spirit is just.
山岳江河？那岂止是没有寿元的限制，你何曾见过山岳突破化神？¤Mountains and rivers? That is not only no life expectancy limit, you have ever seen the mountain break through the Deity Transformation?
道别过后，你便原路返回到了地面。¤After saying goodbye, you returned to the ground the same way you came.
数万年，即使对于顶尖的化神强者来说，这依然是个天文数字。她们究竟如何修炼数万年？你陷入了疑虑。¤Tens of thousands of years, even for the top Deity Transformation powerhouse, this is still an astronomical number. How exactly do they cultivate for tens of thousands of years? You are in doubt.
（腼腆地）什么嘛，吊人家胃口…讨厌…¤(Coyly) What, hang people's appetite...annoying...
既然如此，在下便不再追问了，祝二位成功飞升，后会有期！¤In that case, I will not ask further questions, wish you two successful ascension, see you later!
（腼腆地）二姐，人家都说了自己的事情了，咱们却什么都不告诉人家，不太好吧…？¤(Coyly) Second sister, people have said their own things, but we do not tell them anything, not good, right ...?
能惊起这么大的天地异象，这气眼之内定然不是凡物，还是小心为上。¤If you can cause such a big heaven and earth phenomenon, the eye of the air is certainly not ordinary things, it is better to be careful.
（邪魅地）嘁嘁嘁，今天便让你明白，化神与化神之间的差距，就如同化神与蝼蚁的差距一样大！¤(chortling evilly) heheHehahaHA, today I'll teach you that the difference between two Deity Transformation cultivators can be is as great as a God of the Heavens and a mole in the dirt!
气眼最终落在了一个小山包上。你避开了气眼，落到一边的碎石上，开始仔细观察此地。¤The eye of air eventually landed on a small mountain bag. You avoided the eye, landed on the side of the debris, and began to carefully observe the place.
可此处诡异至极，我用神识竟探测不到丝毫，这当如何是好？¤The first time I saw this, I was able to detect it with my soul sense.
幽荧2¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're doing.
这只灵雀已然像金鹏一样，那还如何融入原本的灵雀一族呢？¤This spirit bird is already like the golden roc, then how else can it be integrated into the original spirit bird clan?
你隐隐猜到了些什么东西，但若直言相问，恐会生变；若就此离去，心又不甘。¤You vaguely guessed something, but if you ask directly, fear of change; if this leaves, the heart and unwilling.
（腼腆地）我们有这么多黑石头，分人家一两块嘛。¤(Coyly) We have so many black stones, share one or two with others.
哈哈哈哈，这结局嘛…下次见面的时候再告诉你~¤Hahahahaha, this ending well... I'll tell you the next time we meet~
突破的过程最多只是阴气在体内的变化而已，但我要怎么模拟雷劫？怎么模拟飞升的通道？¤The process of breakthrough is at most just a change of Yin Qi in the body, but how am I going to simulate a thunderstorm? How can I simulate the passage to ascension?
至于答案，届时自会有分晓。¤As for the answer, the answer will be revealed at that time.
刚还夸你聪明，不会这么点东西都看不出来吧？¤I just praised you for being smart, you can't not see such a thing, right?
虽说她看起来是少女模样，但想来也不可能是真的少女。如此情形下，你组织了一套不太容易冒犯人的说辞。¤Although she looks like a young girl, but I think it is impossible to be a real young girl. In such a situation, you organized a set of sayings that are not too easy to offend people.
顺着气旋的吸引力，片刻之后，你便到达了气旋的尽头。¤Following the attraction of the cyclone, you reach the end of the cyclone after a few moments.
不能以常理揣摩？那恐怕已经超脱天地法则之外，超越人的范畴了吧？¤You can't speculate with common sense? That I'm afraid has gone beyond the laws of heaven and earth, beyond the realm of man, right?
嘁，飞升又不一样。¤Ch, ascension is not the same.
本座好歹也是化神修为，今天倒要看看你这妖孽究竟有何神通，胆敢如此猖狂？¤I am at least a Deity Transformation, so today I want to see what kind of power you have, you demon, that you dare to be so rampant?
（冷静地）话虽如此，但多一块石头，{$时间}年后便多一分飞升的机会。¤(calmly) That said, but one more stone, {$time} years later will be one more chance of ascension.
你祭出避阴珠，再做好防护，应该没有大碍。¤You sacrifice the yin avoidance bead, and then do a good job of protection, there should be no big problem.
此地极浓的阴气对常人而言凶险无比，阁下说因为好奇就甘冒如此风险，恐怕所言非实吧。¤The extremely dense Yin Qi in this area is incredibly dangerous for normal people, so I'm afraid you're not telling the truth when you say you're willing to take such a risk because you're curious.
空气忽然又沉默下来。你隐隐察觉到，这回可能真的触碰到底线了。¤The air suddenly fell silent again. You vaguely perceive that this time you may have really hit the bottom line.
（冷静地）倘若这只灵雀将外观、声音等一切全都模仿成金鹏的样子，能瞒过金鹏也说不定。¤(calmly) If this spirit sparrow imitates the appearance, voice and everything else as the Golden Roc, it might be able to hide from the Golden Roc.
你若好奇，届时再来看看便是。¤If you are curious, you can come back then to see it.
“永恒的存在…这就是他们所看到的世界吗？”¤Eternal existence...is this the world they see?
纵然你已是化神修为，但遇到这种从未见过之事，你依然不敢懈怠半分。¤Even though you are already at the cultivation level of a Deity Transformation , when you encounter something like this that you have never seen before, you still don't dare to slacken off even half a bit.
（腼腆地）唔…这只灵雀也太可怜了…既然它跟金鹏一样大，一样强，那它为什么就不能是金鹏呢？¤(Coyly) Well...this spirit bird is too pitiful...since it is as big and strong as the golden roc, why can't it be a golden roc?
当然~这就要从很久很久以前说起了。¤Of course ~ this has to start from a long, long time ago.
（冷静地）……¤(calmly) ......
（腼腆地）是呀，二姐已经为飞升准备了好久好久。¤(coyly) Yes, second sister has been preparing for ascension for a long, long time.
（邪魅地）荧儿与二姐你都见过，我自然就是三妹了。¤(Evilly) fluorescence and second sister you have seen, I am naturally the third sister.
“若此人与岛主他们勾结，知道我对岛主他们不利，定然不会善罢甘休。”¤If this person colluded with the island master and them, and knew that I was against the island master and them, he would definitely not give up in peace.
后来又观察人类修士突破的规律，又模拟出了筑基、结丹、结婴与化神的过程。¤Later, he observed the pattern of human cultivators breakthrough, and simulated the process of foundation building, dan, infant and Deity Transformation.
（冷静地）……依我看，不然。¤(Calmly) ...... In my opinion, otherwise.
一时间，你与她纯白的眸子四目相视，第一反应竟是觉得有些漂亮。¤A time, you and her pure white eyes four eyes, the first reaction is actually feel some beautiful.
（腼腆地）二姐你干嘛那么凶，好不容易有个人来陪我们说说话，都要被你吓跑了。¤(Coyly) Second sister, why are you so mean? It's so hard to have someone to talk with us, and you're scaring us away.
就在你试图理解她的想法时，她又开了口。¤Just as you are trying to understand her thoughts, she opens her mouth again.
所幸非也所引发的骚动并未结束，你便趁机溜了出去。¤Fortunately, the commotion caused by non also did not end, so you took the opportunity to slip out.
短暂的寂静后，幽荧的表情和语气都变得与之前截然不同，俨然就像变了一个人。¤After a short period of silence, the expression and tone of Yulian became very different from before, just like a different person.
而恰巧这只灵雀的颜色与金鹏也无二致，所以它出生时便对自己是金鹏这件事深信不疑。¤And it happens that the color of this spirit bird is the same as the golden roc, so it was born with no doubt that it is a golden roc.
“不能以常理揣摩，那究竟还能不能称之为人？”¤Can't speculate with common sense, then can we still call it a person or not?
传言蓬莎岛上还没有修士的时候，有一只灵雀。它出生之时第一眼看见的不是父母，而是天空中的一只金鹏。¤Rumor has it that when there were no cultivators on Pongsha Island, there was a spirit bird. When it was born, the first thing it saw was not its parents, but a golden roc in the sky.
（冷静地）况且…这灵雀也未必不能变成金鹏。¤(Calmly) Moreover... this spirit bird may not be unable to turn into a golden roc.
既然你们已是不灭之身，为何要花这么多心思寻求突破？不对，究其根本，你们为什么想要模仿人类？¤Since you are already indestructible, why do you need to spend so much effort to seek a breakthrough? No, at the root, why do you want to imitate humans?
神识扫过，只见山包之外皆是一些土块碎石，毫无宝物的踪迹。¤The consciousness swept through, only to see that outside the mountain bag are some dirt blocks of debris, no trace of treasures.
（冷静地）阁下不说明白便想走？若是想对我们不利，我等岂不是放虎归山？¤(Calmly) Your Excellency wants to leave without making yourself clear? If you want to do us harm, are we not letting the tiger return to the mountain?
对于我们来说，所谓寿元的限制就只是个笑话而已。¤For us, the so-called limit of longevity is just a joke.
他是我的恩师，绝不可能拱手让给你的。¤He is my benefactor, never give up to you.
幽荧1¤Youfang1
既然问题就出在体型与实力上，它索性去了浪方海域，找到了体型与实力都最强的鲲族，学习它们的成长修炼之法。¤Since the problem lies in the size and strength, it simply went to the wave side of the sea, found the size and strength of the strongest Kun clan, to learn their growth cultivation method.
我和二姐、三妹一同修炼，应该…也算不上一个人吧…？¤I cultivate with my second and third sisters, so I should...not be considered a person...?
若是要陪姑娘说说话，倒是也无妨。只是不知姑娘是何方高人，竟独自在此修炼？¤If you want to talk with the girl, there is no harm. But I don't know who you are, how can you be alone in this cultivation?
（冷静地）哼，果然来者不善。如此就休怪我们不客气了。¤(calmly) Hmph, you are really not nice. So you can blame us for not being polite.
（邪魅地）看在你把我放出来的份上，有什么想知道的，尽管问吧。¤(Evilly) For the sake of you putting me out, if there is anything you want to know, just ask.
（腼腆地）哎，二姐人其实很好的，只是太过谨慎了。¤(Coyly) Hey, the second sister is actually very nice, just too cautious.
“二姐这反应，应该是听懂了我的{color=#d0380a}暗喻{/color}。”¤With this reaction, second sister should have understood my {color=#d0380a} allusion{/color}.
（冷静地）后会有期。¤(calmly) See you later.
（腼腆地）你们在说什么啊？那可怜的小灵雀最后究竟怎么样了？故事还没说完呢！¤(Coyly) What are you talking about? What happened to the poor little lark in the end? We haven't finished the story yet!
此处一片漆黑，冰冷刺骨，但阴气浓度陡降——甚至不如地面上浓郁。¤This place is pitch black, cold and biting, but the concentration of Yin Qi dropped steeply - even less dense than on the ground.
在下只是碰巧路过，见此奇景颇为好奇，下来看看罢了。¤I just happened to be passing by and was curious to see this strange sight, so I came down to take a look.
幽荧3¤Youfang3
否则若此人一开始便打的是我们的主意，我们定会陷入被动。¤Otherwise, if this person starts to fight is our idea, we will certainly be in a passive.
三妹便是借助一次月环蚀成功突破化神的，可厉害了~¤The third sister is with the help of a moon ring eclipse successfully break through the Deity Transformation, can be powerful ~
“罢了，她看上去也不像是穷凶极恶之人，若我没有敌意，想必她也不会出手吧。”¤It's just that she doesn't look like a vicious person, if I don't have hostile intent, I'm sure she won't make a move.
（腼腆地）我？二姐说我叫幽荧，你也可以叫我荧儿。¤(Coyly) Me? The second sister said my name is Yuefeng, you can also call me Yuefeng'er.
（冷静地）的确，若是谎言，一时间恐怕无法说到如此细致。¤(Calmly) Indeed, if it was a lie, I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to talk about it in such detail for a while.
道友若信不过在下，在下离开便是。¤If you don't trust me, I'll leave.
她双手捂着脸，身体剧烈地抖动了一阵，再见时俨然已经是另一个表情。¤She covered her face with both hands, her body shaking violently for a while, goodbye as if it was already another expression.
虽然继续问下去可能会很不妙，但好奇心仍驱使你继续了下去。¤Although it might be unwise to keep asking, curiosity drove you to continue.
踏上“山包”，展开灵气护罩抵挡风压与潜在的威胁，你缓缓地一步步向气眼走去。¤Stepping onto the 'mountain bag' and unfolding your aura shield to shield you from the wind pressure and potential threats, you slowly walk step by step towards the eye of the air.
所以，它从小便像金鹏一样飞，同小金鹏们一起修炼，一起觅食，一起玩耍。¤So, it grew up flying like a golden roc, with the little golden roc cultivation, foraging together, playing together.
嗯？何以见得？¤Hmm? What makes you think so?
飞升之事，我知之甚少…不过想做成此等逆天之事，只能说难上加难。¤I know very little about ascension... but to make such an unbelievable thing, I can only say that it is much more difficult.
（冷静地）…若按照常理来说自当如此，不过我们却不能以常理揣摩，道友还是少问为好。¤(Calmly) ... if according to common sense since it should be, but we can't speculate with common sense, the daoist friend or less questions is better.
而那山包却有一种极其诡异的力量，让你的神识难以寸进。¤And that mountain bag but there is an extremely bizarre power, so that your soul sense is difficult to inch in.
可…寻常化神千年之后便要渡劫，道友如何做到万年不飞升？¤But... ordinary Deity Transformation will have to cross the tribulation after a thousand years, how can you do it for ten thousand years without ascending?
虽说神阴石能在岛主那换到不少好处，但此刻你却视若无睹。因为你知道，那气眼中才是真正的宝物。¤Although the divine Yin stone can be exchanged for a lot of benefits at the island master, but at the moment you turn a blind eye to it. Because you know that the real treasure is in the eyes of that Qi.
虽然表面上是称赞与感谢，但她的语气却充满了讥讽。¤Although outwardly praising and thanking, her tone was full of ridicule.
（冷静地）即便如此，也要先摸清此人底细才行。¤(Calmly) Even so, we have to find out the details of this person first.
多亏了你，我才能出来透透气，谢谢你啊！¤Thanks to you, I was able to come out for some air. Thank you!
（邪魅地）你可是跟我说尽最大努力渡劫的，这剑里的魂体可是上好的养料，岂有不拿的道理？¤(Evilly) But you told me to do my best to cross the tribulation, the soul in this sword is a good nourishment, how can I not take it?
所幸非也所引发的骚动并未结束，你便趁机溜了出去，但心里仍在思考方才的事情。¤Fortunately, the commotion caused by Feiya did not end, so you took the opportunity to slip out, but your mind was still thinking about what happened in the party.
（冷静地）我便是她二姐，敢问阁下是何人？为何来此？¤(calmly) I am her second sister. May I ask who you are? Why have you come here?
这个故事是你临时编造的，在此之前不可能有人听过。但二姐的话却让你觉得，她似乎比你更懂这只灵雀的处境。¤This story was made up by you on the spot, and it is unlikely that anyone had heard it before then. But the second sister's words make you think that she seems to understand the situation of this spirit bird better than you do.
这么说来，你们步入化神期已经至少数万年了？！¤So you've been in the Deity Transformation stage for at least tens of thousands of years?
我就轻松多了，只需要专心修炼就行了。¤It's much easier for me, I just need to concentrate on my cultivation.
老头，若有宝物的话，只有可能在那气眼了。¤Old man, if there is a treasure, it is only possible that it is in that eye of air.
无碍，这神阴石于我也是无用。倒是你说的数万年…究竟是什么情况？¤No hindrance, this divine Yin stone is also useless to me. But you said tens of thousands of years...what exactly is the situation?
（腼腆地）二姐，{ta}说的很有趣，不像是在撒谎。¤(coyly) Second sister, {ta} said it funny, not like a lie.
但它们根本就不是一个种族，金鹏们不愿意接纳它的原因远没有这么简单。所以最终，那只灵雀也没能如愿。¤But they are not a race at all, and the reason why the Golden Rocs are not willing to accept it is far from simple. So in the end, that spirit bird didn't get what it wanted.
她发出了一串吊诡的邪笑，你只觉不寒而栗。¤She let out a string of dangling evil laugh, you just feel unnerved.
（冷静地）既然灵雀都已经花费了这么多心血，只要有一丝希望尚在，不试上一试岂会甘心？¤(calmly) Since the spirit sparrow has spent so much effort, as long as there is a glimmer of hope is still alive, will not be willing to try?
若有影响到道友修炼，在下便不再叨扰了。¤If there is an impact on the cultivation of the daoist friend, I will no longer chatter.
（冷静地）够了，阁下问的也够多了吧。¤(Calmly) Enough, your Excellency has asked enough questions, right?
“还是说…它本不是人，但是却想像人一样修炼飞升？”¤Or does it mean... it is not human originally, but wants to cultivate and ascend like a human?
空气中已经开始弥漫火药味。若要如实相告，则会暴露自己的行径与目的；但若要糊弄过去，一时之间恐怕想不出什么借口。你陷入了两难的境地。¤The smell of gunpowder had begun to fill the air. If you were to tell the truth, you would reveal your deeds and purpose; but if you were to muddle through, I'm afraid you couldn't think of any excuse for a while. You are caught in a dilemma.
一时间，你与她纯白的眸子四目相视，但以你化神的修为，竟也看不穿她的深浅。¤For a moment, you meet her pure white eyes, but with your Deity Transformation cultivation, you cannot see through her depths.
（邪魅地）等等，你可以走，但你背的这把剑却得留下。¤(Evilly) Wait, you can go, but this sword you carry has to stay.
道别后，你便沿着气旋返回到了地面。¤After saying goodbye, you returned to the ground along the cyclone.
我将我们最初的阴气铸成人类身体的样子，准确地复现了每一条经络，再将吸收阴气的过程伪装成修士修炼的过程。¤I cast our initial Yin Qi into the appearance of a human body, accurately reproducing each meridian and then disguising the process of absorbing Yin Qi as a cultivator's cultivation.
你根本就不知道这有多难。¤You have no idea how difficult this is.
你将一切都如实告诉了她，从看见魂体开始，到非也对岛主的怀疑…¤You told her everything truthfully, starting from seeing the soul body, to the suspicions of the non-also islander...
但这极阴之物对我们而言也是至关重要，阁下那朋友的算盘恐怕要落空了。¤But this extremely Yin thing is also vital to us, your friend's calculations are afraid to fall short.
每当月环蚀出现时，阴气也会极盛，我们就可以借机做许多事情。¤Whenever there is a lunar eclipse, the Yin energy will also be extremely strong, so we can take the opportunity to do many things.
（腼腆地）二姐，他现在跟那些撒谎的人一样…我不太喜欢…¤(Coyly) Second sister, he is now like those who lie...I don't like it very much...
（腼腆地）不…不得罪……只是好久没人陪我说话了，突然有些不适应而已…¤(Coyly) No...not offended ...... just no one to talk with me for a long time, suddenly a little uncomfortable just...
你不想暴露你来此的目的，仓促间编了一个勉强能说通的故事。¤You do not want to reveal the purpose of your visit here, hastily made up a story that can barely make sense.
对面这个问题，幽荧思考了片刻。¤Opposite this question, you flux thought for a moment.
唉…好不容易有个人来，这么快就要走了…¤Alas ... so easy to have someone to come, so soon to go ...
既然如此，这灵雀究竟如何变成金鹏，届时我一定要见证一番。¤In that case, I must witness how this spirit bird turns into a golden roc.
但是荧儿想要像修士一样修炼，二姐也想不出办法，她就把这个任务交给了我。¤But fluorescent child wants to cultivate like a cultivator, second sister can not think of a way, she gave me this task.
我们最开始能意识到自己存在的时候，只是一团有灵智的阴气罢了。¤The first time we were aware of our existence, we were just a cloud of spiritually intelligent Yin Qi.
（冷静地）这便是我们的秘密了，还请阁下莫要追问。¤(calmly) This is our secret, please don't ask after it.
此地阴气难道都被气眼吸走了？¤Is this place Yin Qi are sucked away by the eye of Qi?
幽荧突然一愣，随即流露出痛苦的神情。¤You feng suddenly froze, and then showed a pained look.
不知道荧儿对这只灵雀怎么看？¤I wonder what Fluorescence's opinion of this spirit bird is?
否则若将三妹唤出来，只怕道友难以全身而退。¤If not, if the third sister is called out, I am afraid that you will not be able to escape in one piece.
（冷静地）好，一言为定。¤(calmly) Yes, it's a deal.
哈哈哈哈，无妨，那便不说这些无趣的修行之事了，我来给荧儿讲个故事吧？¤Hahahahaha, no harm, then do not talk about these uninteresting cultivation matters, I'll tell a story to fluorescence, right?
就算会被接纳，它的年龄对于普通灵雀来说，就像是永恒的存在，又要如何像正常的灵雀一样觅食、玩耍、相爱，感受灵雀的快乐呢？¤Even if it will be accepted, its age is like an eternity for ordinary spirit sparrows, so how are you going to forage, play, love each other and feel the joy of a spirit sparrow like a normal spirit sparrow?
（邪魅地）嘁嘁嘁嘁嘁嘁！¤(Evilly) ch ch ch ch ch ch ch!
听到这个问题，她的脸瞬间沉了下来。¤Hearing this question, her face instantly sank.
此情此景之下，你想出了一个委婉试探的方法。¤Under this circumstance, you came up with a euphemism to try to find out.
（腼腆地）噗…这只灵雀好可爱，我喜欢~¤(Coyly) Pfft...this spirit bird is so cute, I like it~
（邪魅地）哦？那就要看你有没有这个本事了。¤(Evilly) Oh? That depends on whether you have the ability to do so.
气眼外是一层极其狂暴的风眼墙，但你毕竟也不是凡人。在大致估量了它的威力之后，你便加足护罩，闯了进去。¤Outside the air eye is an extremely violent wall of wind eye, but you are not a mortal after all. After roughly estimating its power, you will add enough shields and break in.
眼前的魔物上半身被颜色诡异的鳞片包裹着，双爪锋利且尖锐。最为惹眼的是胸部正中的晶体，在昏暗的光下闪烁着妖异的光彩。¤The upper body of the monster in front of you is wrapped in strangely colored scales, and its claws are sharp and pointed. The most eye-catching thing is the crystal in the middle of the chest, shining with a strange light in the dim light.
一只低阶魔物突然从旁冲出，挡住了你前行的道路。¤A low-level monster suddenly rushed out from the side, blocking your path.
这位客官想要看些什么，各种炼器材料我百宝行应有尽有。¤What does this customer want to see? I have everything from my treasure shop to all kinds of refining materials.
不止这位{FirstName}师妹，我看你们门派的白露师妹也是身手不凡。¤Not only this {FirstName} Junior Sister, I think your Sister Bai Lu is also very skilled.
（低声）哼...虚伪的男人，瞧刚刚徐凡得胜时你那得意的样子。¤(Whispering) Hmph... hypocritical man, look at how proud you were when Xu Fan just won.
小{shidi}今天看起来状态不错。¤Little {shidi} looks good today.
慕容师姐，贵派真是人才辈出啊！¤Sister Murong, your school is really talented!
好大口气！各大修仙门派多的是奇功妙法，就不知道友有没有能耐进去了。¤It's a big breath! The various schools of immortal cultivators have many wonderful techniques, so I don't know if your friends can endure it.
都太低级了，来点更强的功法？¤It's all too low-level, come some stronger exercises?
定眼向中心看去，一个人跌坐在法阵中间，四周已有数人毙倒仅剩一人勉力维护法阵。¤When I look at the centre, I see a man sitting in the middle of an Array, surrounded by several people who have been killed and only one person left to maintain it.
远处一阵焰浪四散开来。¤A wave of flame spreads in all directions in the distance.
轰~{vpunch=10,0.5}¤boom~{vpunch=10,0.5}
不过，你现在身处死门，等我封住你的神魂。我必不会杀你，我要每日定亲手抽出的你精血，日日折磨你。¤However, you are now at the gate of death, and when I seal your soul, I will not kill you. I will not kill you, but I will draw your blood with my own hands every day and torture you day by day.
呼~~嘿嘿嘿，钟道友本门这奇门绝魂阵你觉得如何啊？¤The first time I saw you, I was in the middle of a battle.
哼，又来个找死的。¤Heck, here comes another one looking for death.
咳咳，这阵法倒是精妙，不过布阵之人属实不行。¤Ahem, the formation is subtle, but the person who set it up is really no good.
哼，若不是护法吩咐了活捉你，又怎会如此麻烦。¤Hmph, if the Guardian hadn't command that you be captured alive, how could it have been such a hassle?
笑话，今天我便是要取你性命。¤Joke, today I'm going to kill you.
在下慕名前来，只为讨教一番。¤I came here admiringly, just to ask for advice.
不错，你倒是有几分实力，不过要是再打下去，可就没这么简单了。¤Yes, you have some strength, but if you continue to fight, it will not be so simple.
哈哈哈哈，之前一时技痒多有得罪，看来吞云大圣果然名不虚传。¤Hahahaha, I was offended for a while, and it seems that the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud is indeed well-deserved.
因为只有成为了内门弟子才能，选择一脉拜师加入，不过要是能取得门派大比的魁首倒是也能拜长老为师。¤Because you can only become a disciple of the inner sect, you can choose to join in the same line as a teacher, but if you can get the leader of the school, you can also worship the elder as a teacher.
师兄过奖了。¤Brother praised.
恭喜{shidi}通过擂台赛的考验，以后你就是我们竹山宗的外门弟子了。¤Congratulations to {shidi} for passing the test of the arena. From now on you will be the outer disciple of our Bamboo Mountain Sect.
你成为了第一个能够赢得擂台胜利的挑战者，台下赞许声不绝于耳...¤You became the first challenger to win the arena, and the audience praised endlessly...
你第一个上场就战胜了竹山宗的外门弟子，场下一片哗然...¤You defeated the outer disciple of Bamboo Mountain Sect first on the field, and there was an uproar off the field...
没过多久，剩下的比试便都结束了，除了你以外，再没有一个人能在擂台上获得胜利。¤It didn't take long for the rest of the competition to be over. Apart from you, no one can win the ring.
李青麟赞许地望了你一眼。¤Li Qinglin glanced at you approvingly.
{FirstName}{shidi}，久等了吧。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, wait a long time.
劳烦师兄了。¤Excuse me, brother.
这是为何？？¤Why is this??
师弟，没什么要注意的了，你自己走走吧，记得去神兵堂领符器。¤Junior Brother, there is nothing to pay attention to, you can walk by yourself, remember to go to the Shenbing Hall to pick up the talisman.
幻雾阵其中许多前辈留下的意识形成的灵体，供弟子历练，提升心境和实战经验。但传闻也有高人前辈留下传承考验在其中，静候有缘人了。¤Many of the consciousness-formed spirits left by the predecessors of the Mirage Mist Array are used for disciples to experience, improve their mood and actual combat experience. However, there are also rumors that there are also advanced predecessors who have left inheritance tests in it, waiting for the destined.
药田，竹山宗以培植灵植闻名，其中十数万年的先天乙木、金雷竹更是十分珍贵，弟子可以帮忙照顾灵植，换取修炼资源。¤Medicinal fields, Bamboo Mountain Sect is famous for cultivating spiritual plants. Among them, the tens of thousands of years of innate Yimu and Jinleizhu are very precious. Disciples can help take care of the spiritual plants in exchange for cultivation resources.
方壶山乃是门下资产由金丹期长老驻守，其中有一条灵石矿脉，同时饲养灵兽的御灵监，也在上面。弟子可以执行矿脉巡逻等任务，换取修炼资源。¤Square Cauldron Mountain is a subordinate asset guarded by the elders of the Jindan stage. Among them is a spiritual stone vein, and the imperial guard that raises spirit beasts is also on it. Disciples can perform mineral vein patrols and other tasks in exchange for cultivation resources.
哼，就凭你也想进我竹山宗。¤Hmph, just because you want to enter my Bamboo Mountain Sect.
哈哈哈，{shidi}有所不知，你可是最近几年来唯一一个可以通过外门擂台挑战的人。¤Hahaha, {shidi} knows something, but you are the only one who can challenge through the outer ring in recent years.
不说这些了，{shidi}刚入门，还有诸多事情要办。你先带上我这块信物，去{color=#d0380a}神兵阁{/color}领取门派配属的符器和道袍，然后{color=#d0380a}再回来找我{/color}。¤Leave aside, {shidi} is just getting started, and there are many things to do. You take my token first, and go to {color=#d0380a}Shenbing Pavilion{/color} to receive the runes and robes attached to the sect. , And then {color=#d0380a} come back and find me{/color}.
对了，本门的上乘功法，皆拜师之后习得；不过这是你我突破进入筑基期才能考虑的事情。¤By the way, the superior exercises of this school are all learned after apprenticeship; but this is something you and I can only consider when we break through and enter the foundation building period.
那擂台之上的可是真正修习过竹山宗功法的外门弟子，又岂是寻常的散修能够战胜的。{shidi}年纪虽轻，但攻守有度，我看刚刚连大师兄都对你的表现颇为赞许。¤The ones on the ring are outside disciples who have truly practiced Bamboo Mountain Sect exercises. How can ordinary independent cultivators be defeated. Although {shidi} is young, he has a degree of offense and defense. I think even the big brothers just now I am quite appreciative of your performance.
你带着疑惑来到这水晶面前，开始仔细端详了起来。¤You came to this crystal with your doubts and began to examine it carefully.
约莫半炷香时间，你二人终于走到了楼梯尽头——一间孤独的静室。¤About half an incense stick later, the two of you finally reached the end of the stairs - a lonely quiet room.
水晶随即爆发出恐怖的吸引力，将你的神魂尽数吸引而去。¤The crystal then exploded with a terrifying attraction, drawing all of your divine soul away.
怪哉，若不是在此地，这水晶我定会认作凡品。¤Strange, if I weren't here to experience this I would have thought the crystal was only a mortal treasure...
我也看不清其中玄机…¤I can not see the mystery...
但尽管如此，你仍看不出这些光究竟有何玄机。¤But in spite of this, you still can't see what exactly is the mystery of these lights.
抱着这样的想法，你控制神识向水晶的中心探去。¤With this thought in mind, you control your soul sense to probe towards the center of the crystal.
难道说只有在特定的位置，这些光才会组成有意义的画面？¤Does it mean that only in a specific location will these lights form a meaningful picture?
你不自觉地将神识凝聚到水晶上——水晶内部竟然并非实心，而是由一层层薄如蝉翼的水晶膜构成。¤You unconsciously gather your consciousness to the crystal - the inside of the crystal is not solid, but made up of layers of thin crystal film.
你展开神识想朝四周探测一番，却遭到了不知何物的阻挠，难以寸进。¤You want to explore the surrounding area, but you are blocked by something, it is difficult to advance.
阁下只需静坐下来，仔细观察这水晶便可。¤Your Excellency only need to sit down quietly and carefully observe this crystal will do.
水晶膜上的光也并非原本的深蓝色，而是五彩斑斓。这些光也并非静止状态，而是在不同层面上来回窜动。¤The light on the crystal film is not the original dark blue, but colorful. These lights are also not static, but scurrying back and forth on different levels.
原来如此…多谢阁主。¤I see...thank you, Master.
仔细看去，只见水晶在四周火光的照耀下仍旧黯淡失色，丝毫没有绝世机缘的气息。¤Look carefully, only to see the crystal in the surrounding fire light still dull, not the slightest aura of a great opportunity.
说罢，阁主转身便要离去，但你此刻仍无半点头绪。情急之下，你只得喊住了阁主。¤After saying that, the master turned around to leave, but you still have no clue at this moment. In desperation, you had to call out to the master.
此地乃我阁立阁之本，各方面防卫都极为严密，还望阁下见谅。¤This place is the foundation of my pavilion, and all aspects of defense are extremely tight, so I hope you will forgive me.
…无妨。¤...No harm.
静室异常空旷。除了几根石柱，火把以外，就只剩下中间斑驳的石台，以及石台上悬浮着的一块深蓝色水晶。¤The quiet room was unusually empty. In addition to a few stone pillars, torches, there is only the middle of the mottled stone platform, and a dark blue crystal suspended on the stone platform.
…敢问阁主，此物空无一字，当须如何领悟？¤...dare to ask the master, this object is empty of a word, when how must be comprehended?
藏宝楼下方，是一条狭长的旋转楼梯，深不见底。¤Below the hidden treasure floor is a long, narrow, revolving staircase that is too deep to see the bottom.
这块水晶咋看上去与寻常水晶无二，可一旦你开始专注地观察它，它便有一种神奇的力量始终吸引着你的神魂。¤This crystal may look like an ordinary crystal, but once you start to look at it intently, it has a magical power that always attracts your soul.
待你确认完周遭情况之后，阁主伸手指向了石台上的水晶。¤After you have confirmed the surrounding situation, the master reached out and pointed to the crystal on the stone platform.
呵呵呵，道友莫要心急。越是接近大道，所表达的内容便越是难以用文字表述。¤Ohhhh, the Taoist friend should not be anxious. The closer you are to the Great Dao, the more difficult it is to express what is being expressed in words.
这便是所谓的太虚境，阁下自行领悟便是，范某便先行告退了。¤This is the so-called Great Void Dimension, you can understand it yourself, Fan will first leave.
就在到达中心的那一瞬，水晶膜上的光恰好构成一幅幅真实的画面。¤Just at the moment of reaching the center, the light on the crystal film happens to form a real picture.
虽然不知道那白袍修士要监视宁王府中一个普通的女眷是为何，但以你在府内的供奉身份，做到这点也并不困难。¤Although I don't know why the white-robed cultivator wants to monitor an ordinary female family member in Prince Ning's Mansion, it is not difficult to do this with your guest elder status in the mansion.
到了夜里，她竟偷偷地离开了王府，向城外走去。你只好远远地跟了上去...¤At night, she secretly left the palace and walked outside the city. You had to follow from a distance...
平日里未曾察觉，但仔细监视一段时间后，你确实发现这名女子行动之中的颇多异常之处。大部分时间她都独自一人在府内走动，颇为警觉，也很少与其他妾女有什么交集。¤I didn't notice it on weekdays, but after careful monitoring for a period of time, you did find a lot of abnormalities in the woman's actions. Most of the time she walked alone in the house, quite alert, and rarely interacted with other concubines. What is the intersection of women.
师兄这句话是对你说的，你还不明白了么？¤Brother is saying this to you, don't you understand?
后来藏在暗处的古神教也伺机偷袭想要夺剑，不过那玄骨上人被一直在暗处戒备的星宫宫主拖住，另外一个恶饕老祖也被我拦了下来。¤Later on, the Ancient God Cult, which was hiding in the shadows, also waited for an opportunity to sneak in and try to take the sword, but that Xuan Bone Superior was held back by the Star Palace Palace Master, who had been on guard in the shadows, and the other Evil Taotao Old Man was also stopped by me.
呼，这我就放心了...¤Phew, that's a relief...
我...白帝楼楼主？可是我从来没有...¤I... The owner of the Whitty House? But I've never been...
自从师兄开始准备渡劫以后，白帝楼内外事宜都已经是你在打理了。楼内无论从修为还是声望来看，都没有比你更适合接手白帝楼楼主一职的人了。¤Ever since senior brother started preparing for the tribulation, you have been taking care of all the internal and external matters of the White Emperor Building. In terms of both cultivation and reputation within the building, there is no one more suitable than you to take over the position of the White Emperor Building Master.
师祖...师祖他渡劫成功了么？¤Master... Did he succeed?
诸位化神前辈与那恶饕间发生了一场混战，师兄也被迫出手。最后我们虽然打败了恶饕，另外三柄魔剑却被一直暗中伺机的血剑宫夺了去。¤There was a melee between the Deity Transformation and the evil gourmets, and Brother was forced to fight. In the end, although we defeated the evil gourmets, the other three magic swords were taken away by the Blood Sword Palace who had been secretly waiting for us.
最重要的是，白帝楼楼主要嫉恶如仇，更要以铲灭魔修为己任...倪兄，你一直是最适合的那个人选。¤Most importantly, the owner of the White Emperor House has to be cynical and vengeful, and more importantly, he has to make it his mission to eradicate evil cultivators... Brother Ni, you have always been the most suitable one for the job.
师兄他成功渡劫，如今应该已经飞升上界了吧。¤He has successfully crossed the tribulation and should have ascended to the upper world by now.
哎...可惜师祖没让我跟他一起去，不然我一定能帮上忙的！¤Aigoo... Too bad Shifu didn't let me go with him, otherwise I could have helped!
白帝楼本身只是一个松散的剑修组织，即便身为楼主，也未必需要花费大量的时间管理。¤The White Emperor's House itself is only a loose organisation of sword cultivators, and even as the owner of the House, one may not need to spend a lot of time managing it.
这次我们终于成功拖到师兄渡劫成功，剩下的那些魔门也只能无功而返了。¤This time we finally succeeded in delaying until senior brother succeeded in crossing the tribulation, and the rest of those demon sects had to return without success.
那天魔道的两位尊者也绝非泛泛之辈，若非有灵尊相助，恐怕难以抵挡。¤If not for the help of the Spiritual Daoist, I am afraid it would have been difficult to resist.
不只是这样，师兄还说了此番无论他渡劫成功与否，白帝楼都要交到你们这些后辈的手上。¤Not only that, senior brother also said that this time, no matter whether he succeeds in crossing the tribulation or not, the White Emperor House will be handed over to you juniors.
都怪我...如果我也在场的话，一定能帮上忙的...¤It's my fault... If I had been there, I would have been able to help...
这血剑宫的血亢剑仙实力应该不在师兄之下，就连混元子前辈都很难与他抗衡。¤The strength of this Blood Sword Palace's Blood Hyper Sword Immortal should be no less than that of his senior brother, and even Senior Mixer would find it difficult to compete with him.
师兄他在渡劫时被魔门偷袭，没能...¤Senior brother he was attacked by the devil's clan during his tribulation and failed to...
这次师兄渡劫选择的地方是一座孤岛...¤This time the place chosen by the senior brother for his tribulation is an isolated island...
这...这怎么可能...到底发生了什么事？¤It's... How is this possible... What the hell is going on?
后来藏在暗处的古神教也伺机偷袭想要夺剑，虽说那玄骨上人被一直在暗处戒备的星宫宫主拖住，但那古神教老祖恶饕却不好对付。¤Later on, the Ancient God Cult, which was hiding in the shadows, also waited for an opportunity to sneak in and try to take the sword. Although the Xuan Bone Master was held back by the Star Palace Palace Master, who had been on guard in the shadows, the Ancient God Cult's old ancestor, Evil Taos, was not easy to deal with.
那...那后来呢？你们支撑到师祖渡劫完成了么？¤So... What happened then? Did you hold out until the Master's reincarnation was complete?
你从白帝准备渡劫开始，一直讲到魔门前来夺剑。倪旭欣听的津津有味，不停地向你问这问那...¤You start with the White Emperor preparing for the tribulation and go all the way to the Devil's Gate coming forward to take the sword. Ni XuXin listened with great interest and kept asking you questions about this and that...
师祖...是觉得我实力不济么...¤Master... Do you think I'm not good enough...
你从白帝准备渡劫开始，一直讲到魔门前来夺剑。倪旭欣只是呆呆的楞在那里，似乎还无法接受这个事实。¤You start with the White Emperor preparing to cross the tribulation and go all the way to the Devil's Gate coming forward to take the sword. Ni XuXin just stared blankly, seemingly unable to accept this fact.
可惜这次我没能亲眼见证师祖飞升，{FirstName}{xiongdi}快与我讲讲当时的情景吧！¤Unfortunately I didn't get to witness my Master's ascension this time. {FirstName}{xiongdi}Tell me quickly what it was like!
还记得师兄他临走前对你说的话么？¤Do you remember what he said to you before he left?
师兄他自知到时候无暇顾及你的安危，因此才特意把你留下的。¤He knew he would not have time to take care of you, so he deliberately left you behind.
倪兄，你知道师兄他为什么不让你去么？¤Brother Ni, do you know why he won't let you go, senior brother?
嗯...师祖让我镇守白帝楼，避免被魔门偷袭？¤Hmm... Master asked me to guard the White Emperor's House to avoid a sneak attack by the Demon Sect?
所幸血剑宫那个血河老祖实力很是一般，我解决了他以后才得以抽出手来帮助其他前辈。¤Fortunately, that Patriarch Blood River of the Blood Sword Palace was of average strength, and I was able to spare my hands to help the other seniors after I finished him off.
其实我和师兄早就料到这次飞升魔门会来夺剑，所以才提前邀请其他化神前辈助阵。¤In fact, my senior brother and I had expected that the Ascended Demon Sect would come to take the sword this time, which is why we invited the other Deity Transformation seniors to help us in advance.
谢谢你，{FirstName}{xiongdi}。我知道我该怎么做了。¤Thank you, {FirstName}{xiongdi}. I know what I should do now.
{FirstName}供奉放心，敖灵会在这里为你护法，绝不会让任何人打扰你渡劫。¤Don't worry Guest Elders {FirstName}, Ao Ling will be here to guard you and will never let anyone disturb you during your tribulation.
随着你又一次击散她的阴体，她凭空在你的神识中消失了。究竟是被你彻底击散了，还是以你不知道的形式去了其他地方，你不知道。¤With you knocking apart her Yin body once again, she disappeared in your soul sense out of thin air. Whether it was completely scattered by you, or went elsewhere in a form you don't know, you don't know.
先回去再说吧…¤The first thing to do is to go back and talk about it...
这次我真的以为要交代在这了…还好你能胜过她。¤This time I really thought I was going to be accountable here... Luckily you were able to beat her.
老头，你还好么？¤Old man, are you okay?
竖子无知！能成为延寿丹乃为我等增添寿元乃是他们的福分，我天魔......¤Ignorant child! It is their honour to be the Longevity Pills that fuels us, our Heavenly Demon...
你暗道一身不妙，刚要追上去，只听“嗖”的一身，一道凌厉剑气破空而来，将那名子弟捅个对穿。¤You secretly said that you were not good. Just about to catch up, you just listened to the swish body, and a sharp sword aura came through the air, stabbing that child through the opposite direction.
宁王背靠玄道宗这棵大树，怎么会与你们同流合污？¤Ning King is backed by the big tree of Mystic Dao Sect, how could he be in the same foul play with you?
凡人寿数总有尽时，唯有我道炼药秘法可青春永驻！¤When a mortal's lifespan is always exhausted, only my way of refining medicine can remain youthful forever!
那名天魔道弟子见事态不妙，化作一道血光，扭头便要跑。¤The disciple of the Heavenly Demon Dao turned into a bloody light when the situation was not good, turned his head and started to run.
哼，要不是我们，你以为区区枯木功就能守住他的性命吗？玄道宗又如何，面对长生还不是要乖乖让路！¤Hmph, if it weren't for us, do you think the mere Withered Wood Art could keep his life? How about Mystic Dao Sect, it is not necessary to obediently give way in the face of longevity!
呵呵，这点你不必知道。¤Hehe, you don't need to know this.
呼...既然此事与魔门有关，还是回白帝楼汇报一番吧。¤Phew... Since this matter is related to the Demon Sect, it's better to report back to the White Emperor's House.
你们混进宁王府的目的究竟是什么？！¤What is the purpose of you mixing into the Ning Palace?!
我奉命调查王府也有些日子了，你这次算是帮了我一个小忙，那我也赠你一份机缘。¤It's been a while since I was ordered to investigate the palace. You did me a small favor this time, so I will also give you a chance.
你如今还是筑基修为，这本{color=#d0380a}结丹用的秘术{/color}刚好适合你用，你且拿着好生领悟，对未来结丹多有帮助。¤You are still building a foundation and cultivation base. This {color=#d0380a} secret technique{/color} for alchemy is just right for you. If you have a good life and comprehend it, it will be more helpful to the future for alchemy.
炼药......？你们谋害那些修士竟是为了炼丹？！¤Refining medicine...? You murdered those cultivators for the purpose of refining pills?!
说完这些，他哈哈一笑，便化作一道遁光，消失不见了。¤After saying this, he laughed and turned into a escape light and disappeared.
呵呵，在下恰好有几分敛息的手段罢了，不值一提。¤Hehe, there just happen to be a little bit of interest-grabbing means underneath, it's not worth mentioning.
话音未落，他原本狂妄的表情骤然变得惊恐万分。你正想询问缘由时，一股诡异的灵力扩散开，那黑袍老人的躯体以扭曲的姿势摆动着。不消多时他浑身骨肉化成一滩腥臭的黑水...¤Before he finished speaking, his arrogant expression suddenly became terrified. When you were about to ask the reason, a strange spiritual force spread, and the body of the black-robed old man swayed in a twisted posture. Not long after he was covered with flesh and blood Turned into a pool of stenchy black water...
混进？我们才是宁王府真正的座上宾，那些散修也配和我等相提并论？¤Hunjin? We are the real guests of Prince Ning's Mansion. Those independent cultivators are also worthy of being compared with me?
总之，宁王府的事情牵扯众多，这本与你无关，了解太多对你也没有什么好处。¤In short, there are many things involved in Prince Ning's Mansion. This has nothing to do with you. Knowing too much is not good for you.
道友不必惊慌，我对你没有恶意，刚才见那名魔道弟子要跑，这才替你出手拦截。¤You needn't panic, fellow Daoists, I have no malice against you. I just saw that Demon Dao disciple is going to run, so I can intercept it for you.
嗯，也不知当初伤他的人手段何等诡异，竟要用这种凶险的方式疗伤。¤Well, I wonder what kind of trickery the person who injured him had to use to heal his wounds in such a sinister way.
嗯？这动静是涅槃成功了？¤Hmm? Is this movement the success of Nirvana?
话音未落，一阵远胜之前的生机从麟庙下层迸发而出。¤Before the words left his mouth, a far greater burst of life burst forth from the lower levels of the Lin Temple.
看来是渡过了第八劫。¤It appears to have survived the eighth catastrophe.
这方空间的灵气一瞬间被吸入麟庙。¤The aura of this space was drawn into the Lin Temple in an instant.
这九转涅槃诀也是门凶险异常的奇功，刚刚生机散尽若是稍有差池便是身死道消。¤This Nine Revolutions of Nirvana Technique is also an extremely dangerous martial art, and if you make a mistake, you will die.
“咚..咚..咚..”刚一步入宗门，阵阵心跳声从麟庙中传出。¤'Dang... Dang... Thud...'' As soon as he stepped into the clan gate, a burst of heartbeat sounds came out from the Lin Temple.
突然，麟庙下层的生机熄灭。¤Suddenly, the life in the lower level of the Lin Temple went out.
尔等莫要慌乱，本座小有突破罢了。¤Don't panic, I've only made a small breakthrough.
一株灵药引起了你的注意...原来是{SayStcVal=948}。¤An Pill caught your attention... It turned out to be {SayStcVal=948}.
遁速不足的你，在阵中相形见绌只得退回来。¤You, who are not fast enough, are dwarfed in the formation and have to retreat.
不好！¤not good!
眼前的是一座{$Var}的防御阵法。¤The one in front of me is a {$Var} defensive formation.
你凭借遁速强闯而过，但还是难免狼狈。¤You drove through with your speed, but you are still embarrassed.
呼~~¤Huh~~
你通过对{$wudaoname2}的领悟，通过了此地阵法。¤You passed the formation here through your comprehension of {$wudaoname2}.
你通过对{$wudaoname1}的领悟，通过了此地阵法。¤You passed the formation here through your comprehension of {$wudaoname1}.
对{$wudaoname1}的领悟，难以通过此地阵法。¤The comprehension of {$wudaoname1} is difficult to pass the formation here.
你御起{$Var1}，抽空此方空间灵气，使得此地阵法暂时失效，通过了此地阵法。¤You raised {$Var1}, and took out the aura of this space, which temporarily invalidated the formation of this place, and passed the formation of this place.
对{$wudaoname2}的领悟，难以通过此地阵法。¤The comprehension of {$wudaoname2} is difficult to pass the formation here.
此事我早已筹划多年，人多了倒未必方便行事。¤I have been planning this for years, but it may not be convenient to have more people.
会的¤Clubs
多亏你的建议，和从小修炼引火之术的基础，现在我已能够完全掌控这异火了。¤Thanks to your advice and the foundation of my childhood training in the art of drawing fire, I am now able to fully control this foreign fire.
何况...这本就应该由我一人承担，我必须要亲手取他们的性命！¤What's more... This should have been mine alone, I must take their lives myself!
若是暗中偷袭，逐一击破，我有信心取他们性命。¤If I were to sneak up on them in secret and attack them one by one, I would be confident of taking their lives.
我就要出发了，还有什么事么？¤I'm about to leave, is there anything else?
也算是有惊无险，先回去复命吧。¤It can be considered as a surprise, so let's go back and return to life first.
一番搜查，并无收获，接下来的时间也是风平浪静。¤A search, but no results, the rest of the time was calm.
你将见闻告知他，¤You tell him what you have seen,
此人是谁？明明只是炼气中期的气息，战斗力却如此之强，且功法神通却完全与我宁州大陆不同。¤Who is this person? Obviously, it is only the aura in the middle stage of Qi refining, but the combat power is so strong, and the magical powers are completely different from my Ning Province mainland.
算了，先发信号示警吧。¤Forget it, send a signal to warn first.
那人是谁？明明只是炼气中期的气息，但功法神通却完全与我宁州大陆不同。¤Who is that person? Obviously it is only the aura in the middle stage of refining qi, but the magical powers of the exercises are completely different from my Ning Province mainland.
师弟，发生了何事？¤Junior Brother, what happened?
我们通知师兄弟查探一番。¤We notified the brothers to investigate.
而且，另一个人又是谁？方壶山是我竹山宗地界外人难以进入，他们为何在此碰头？¤Besides, who is the other person? Square Cauldron Mountain is difficult for outsiders from the Bamboo Mountain clan to enter. Why are they meeting here?
此行至少知道了些情报，先回去复命吧。¤At least I got some information on this trip, so let's go back and return first.
师弟，刚刚此地灵气波动剧烈，发生了何事？¤Junior Brother, the spiritual energy fluctuates violently here just now, what happened?
还好我遁术不差。¤Fortunately, my escape technique is not bad.
而且，另一个人又是谁？方壶山是我竹山宗地界外人难以进入，他们为何在此碰头？难道有内鬼？¤Moreover, who is the other person? Square Cauldron Mountain is difficult for outsiders to enter in my Bamboo Mountain sect. Why are they meeting here? Is there an inner ghost?
下面开始本届英杰会决赛的比试，请刚刚晋级的两名选手上台！¤Let's start the final battle of this years Young Hero Competition! The two daoists who have made it this far, come on stage!
（作揖）在下公孙季，初次见面，请道友赐教。¤(Zuoyi) I met for the first time in Xia Gongsun Ji, please enlighten me from fellow daoists.
沸腾的人群突然安静下来，只见一名身着白袍的俊朗公子，轻摇折扇，缓步走上台来，面带笑意地看着你。¤The boisterous crowd suddenly falls silent, only to see a handsome gentleman dressed in white robes, gently shaking his folding fan, slowly walking up to the stage and looking at you with a smile on his face.
你这{xiaozi}才修炼没几日，能过第二轮就已经算不错了。¤You {xiaozi} have only cultivated for a few days, and it’s considered good if you can pass the second round.
好不容易进了第三轮...真不甘心...¤Finally made it to the third round... I'm really not reconciled...
对面修为不弱，输了便是技不如人，没什么好垂头丧气的。¤The opponent is not weak, so if you lose, you are not as good as the others, so there is nothing to be down about.
一阵香风飘过，只见一名蒙面少女轻轻落在台上，一双美目好奇地打量着你。¤A fragrant breeze passed by, I saw a masked girl gently falling on the stage, a pair of beautiful eyes looking at you curiously.
当然用不了三个回合，打赢你，两个回合就够了。¤Of course it doesn't take three rounds. To beat you, two rounds are enough.
恭喜{FirstName}{LastName}选手获得这一轮比试的胜利！¤Congratulations to {FirstName}{LastName} player for winning this round of competition!
这么久不见，不知道你的修为长进了没有？¤I haven't seen you for so long, I wonder if your cultivation level has improved?
下面开始本届英杰会决赛的比试，{FirstName}道友，你这次的对手是林小姐。¤Here begins the final competition of this year's Yingjiehui, {FirstName}Daoist, your opponent this time is Miss Lin.
哼，请指教！¤Huh, please advise!
{FirstName}道友，我们又见面了，还请赐教。¤{I'd like to ask you a question.
哈哈哈，{xiongdi}，没想到咱们会在这英杰会的决赛上遇到。¤Hahaha, {xiongdi}, I didn’t expect we would meet in the finals of the Heroes’ Club.
这姑娘...炼气期就有这等神识，真是不简单，你可要小心了。¤This girl... It's not easy to have this kind of soul sense at the Qi refining stage, so be careful.
升仙台下的人群突然沸腾了起来，一名身材健壮的大汉纵身越上擂台，走到你的面前...¤The crowd under Shengxiantai suddenly boiled, and a sturdy man jumped onto the ring and walked in front of you...
这...这是幻象么？¤Is this... Is this an illusion?
你正庆幸自己躲过一劫时，眼前的景象却突然扭曲起来，刚刚被你击败的修士面容变换，又重新向你攻来。¤You are glad that you have escaped death when the scene before you suddenly distorts and the face of the cultivator you have just defeated changes and comes back at you.
竟能同时拥有四柄魔剑，他到底是谁？¤Who is he to possess four magic swords at the same time?
待他回头再看时，却发现火麒麟、混元子及明山三人却是在慢悠悠地聊着天，宛如散步一般，如此悠然却也未被劫云吞噬。¤When he looked back, he found that the Fire Qilin, Mixer and Ming Shan were chatting slowly, as if they were taking a walk, so leisurely that they were not swallowed by the robbery cloud.
不过他虽然可恨，但仙子要为了他和这么多化神交手，可不值得啊。不如我们...¤But although he is hateful, it's not worth it for immortal to fight so many Deity Transformation for him. How about we...
你自知不是化神强者的对手，连忙躲至众人身后。血河老祖见此嚣张的大笑起来，转而冲向了白鹿真人。¤You know that you are no match for the strongest of the Deity Transformation and hastily hide behind the crowd. Seeing this, Patriarch Blood River laughed arrogantly and turned to rush towards the White Deer Reality.
万物皆属造化，唯灵气被修士夺。这造化劫虽威力不大，却有消融灵气护罩之能，是极为难缠的雷劫啊。¤All things belong to creation, but only spiritual energy is taken away by cultivators. Although this creation tribulation is not very powerful, it has the ability to dissolve the aura shield, making it an extremely difficult lightning tribulation.
未等明山说完，只见一道剑气划过天际，竟硬生生的将刚刚聚集起来的天雷劫云一劈为二。¤Before Ming Shan could finish his speech, he saw a Sword Qi slicing through the sky, which actually hardened and split the heavenly thunder and tribulation cloud that had just gathered into two.
火麒麟迎上红莲，混元子对上血亢...正魔两道的化神转瞬间便战作一团，而刚刚一直站在血薇身后的血河老祖，此时也正一脸坏笑的看着你。¤The Fire Qilin met the Red Lotus, the Hybrid Son took on the Blood Hyper... The two Deity Transformation of the righteous and devilish dao fought in a flash, while Patriarch Blood River, who had just been standing behind Blood Wei, was now looking at you with a wicked smile on his face.
化神强者之间，轻易不愿交战。你明白，宁州的诸位化神强者虽出于情分答应替白帝护法，却不至于为此赌上性命，以领域相争。¤Deity Transformation powerhouses are reluctant to engage in battle with each other. You understand that, although the Deity Transformation cultivators of Ning Province have agreed to guard the White Emperor out of affection, they are not willing to risk their lives to do so and fight over the realm.
{size=31}噢？第三道竟是造化劫，有趣。{/size}¤{size=31}Oh? The third one is actually a creation disaster, interesting. {/size}
这心魔劫按说只有渡劫者心境不稳时才会出现。凌老儿怎么会...¤This Heart Demon Tribulation is said to only appear when the person crossing the tribulation is in an unstable state of mind. How could Elder Ling...
让凌轩把戮仙剑交出来，我可以放他一条生路。¤Let Ling Xuan hand over the Immortal Executing Sword and I can let him live.
不过，白鹿真人看到你也站在他侧边不远处，本在他脸上若隐若现的窘迫似乎是消散了去。¤However, the embarrassment that had been lurking on his face seemed to dissipate when the White Deer realist saw that you were also standing a short distance to his side.
{size=31}下一道雷劫？{/size}¤{size=31}The next thunderbolt? {/size}
{vpunch=10,0.5}藏头露尾之辈，给本座出来！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Hide your head and show yourself to me!
你点点头，一旁的白鹿真人闻言也是若有所思。¤You nod, and the real White Deer on the other side of the room smiles.
血亢剑仙此言当真？¤Is this true?
闻言，众人皆抬头望向天空，只见刚刚紫色的劫云又逐渐转为黑色，光是看着便让你感觉心像被石头压着一样，有着难以喘息的感觉。¤At these words, everyone looked up at the sky, only to see the purple clouds gradually turning black again, and just looking at them made you feel like your heart was being pressed down by a stone, with a feeling of difficulty in catching your breath.
薇儿，不要急。¤Violet, don't be in a hurry.
要开始了，{shidi}。¤It's about to start, {shidi}.
今日在这劫云之下，我定不会辜负这一称号！¤Today, under these clouds of calamity, I will not fail to live up to this title!
我修真千余载，其间辗转多地。学道于宁州，悟道于中州，卫道于雍州，如今终于是受到此界的压制，不得不渡劫迎接飞升。¤I have been cultivating for more than a thousand years, and during that time I have moved from place to place. I learned the Way in Ning Province, realized the Way in Zhongzhou, and defended the Way in Yongzhou. Now I have finally been suppressed by this realm and have had to cross the tribulation to prepare for my ascension.
不过这下一道雷劫，可就没有那么好对付了。¤This next thunderclap, however, is not so easy to deal with.
这前几道威能稍小的雷劫，一般来说会在天雷劫，风火劫和阴阳劫中...¤These first few slightly less powerful thunderclaps would normally be among the Heavenly Thunderclap, Wind and Fireclap and Yin Yangclap...
{size=31}小娃儿不用担心，除非是是执意要与它抗衡，不然它也就是将修士驱赶开罢了。{/size}¤{size=31}Don't worry, little baby, unless you're is determined to fight against it, then you'll just drive all the cultivators here away. {/size}
两道遁光闪过，只见一男一女两人出现在血剑宫众人身旁，想来便是血亢口中提到的天魔道尊者。¤Two flashes of evanescent light showed a man and a woman appearing beside the Blood Sword Palace crowd, presumably the Heavenly Demon Daoist Exalted One mentioned by Blood Hyper.
火麒麟冷哼一声，随即化作一团巨大的火球，正拦在那红芒之前。¤The Fire Qilin snorted coldly and then transformed into a huge ball of fire that stopped right in front of the red mane.
见状，白鹿真人脸色虽是未变，但不自觉地，身形快上了几分。那乌云也是识趣地放弃了将他笼罩在内的“想法”。¤When he saw this, although his face did not change, he unconsciously moved a little faster. The dark cloud also had the good sense to give up the ''idea'' of enveloping him.
红衣女子不为所动，反而祭出一柄魔剑，遥遥指向前方。伴随着上空轰鸣作响的雷云，气氛一时间剑拔弩张起来。¤The woman in red was unmoved, but instead she offered a magic sword and pointed it far ahead. The atmosphere was tense as the thunder clouds roared above.
伴随着雷鸣落下的除了天火，还有几道红芒一闪而过，目标正是白帝。¤Along with the thunder falling, apart from the heavenly fire, there were several flashes of red light, aimed at none other than the White Emperor.
随着碰撞之下的余烟散去，一行三人的身影出现在远处，其中一位正是你曾经见过的血河老祖。¤As the after smoke from the collision clears, a group of three figures appear in the distance, one of whom is none other than Patriarch Blood River you once met.
修炼至化神期后承蒙各州正派道友抬爱，称我为九州第一剑仙。¤After I reached the stage of Deity Transformation, I have been called the First Sword Immortal of Kyushu by the friends of the righteous sects in all states.
{size=31}让我看看这道是...红色，是风火劫吧，怎么有些不太对。{/size}¤{size=31}Let me see if this one is... Red, it's a wind and fire robbery, right? Something's not quite right about it. {/size}
多谢诸位道友前来观礼。¤Thank you all for coming to see the ceremony.
血剑宫...？¤Blood Sword Palace...?
我知道你们想要的是我手中的这柄绝仙剑，不妨我们来做个交易。¤I know that what you want is this Absolute Immortal Sword in my hand, so let's make a deal.
{size=31}嗯，这第一劫果然是那最简单的天雷劫。{/size}¤{size=31}Well, this first tribulation is really that easiest of all, the Heavenly Lightning Tribulation. {/size}
三对{$num}，你们不占优。若还敢轻举妄动，就别怪我们以多欺少了。¤Three against {$num}, you have no advantage. If you still dare to act rashly, don't blame us for bullying the few with the many.
这天劫才刚刚开始，不妨就先看看那凌轩到底有几分本事吧。¤This heavenly tribulation has only just begun, so we might as well see how much that Ling Xuan is capable of first.
但这些魔门却不同，你全然摸不清他们的底线。眼下的风平浪静或许只是一时的，他们只是在等待一个更适合出手的时机...¤But these demon clans are different, you can't get a feel for them at all. The calm at the moment may only be temporary, they are just waiting for a more suitable time to strike...
神兽麒麟...这凌轩倒是好大的面子。¤The divine beast Qilin... This Ling Xuan is quite a big face.
混元子说罢，明山散人微微点了点头，表示赞同。¤When Mixing Yuanzi spoke, Ming Shan Sanren nodded slightly in agreement.
那红衣女子淡淡呵斥了一句，血河便不再说话，只是默默后退了一步，将怨毒的目光投向沐浴在闪耀雷光中的那道身影。¤After the woman in red faintly chided her, Blood River stopped speaking and only silently took a step back, casting a resentful gaze at the figure bathed in the glittering thunder light.
哼，这凌轩吹嘘自己是什么第一剑仙，我看也不过是鼠辈而已。若非学了我们血剑宫的功法，哪有他现在的威风。¤Hmph, this Ling Xuan boasts that he is some kind of First Sword Immortal, but I see that he is nothing more than a rat. If he hadn't learnt our Blood Sword Palace's techniques, how could he have the might he has now.
再看那劫云范围正中矗立着的白帝，只见衣袍舞动，飞剑轻扬，也不知那灵气护罩之下是如何一番神态。¤Looking at the white emperor standing in the middle of the cloud, he could see his robes dancing and his flying sword flying, and he did not know how he looked under the aura shield.
只听“轰”的一阵巨响，火球与那红芒一接触，便释放出极为恐怖的能量。漫天火光之下，隐约浮现出一只巨兽的身影。¤There was a loud bang as the fireball and the red aura came into contact, releasing an extremely terrifying energy. Beneath the sky of fire, the figure of a giant beast faintly emerged.
{size=31}打便打吧，刚好和你们这些魔道算算当年的老账！{/size}¤{size=31}So be it, let's settle old scores with you devils! {/size}
你将身后背负的铁剑取下，郑重地交给白帝。白帝接过铁剑，脚踏一股剑气腾飞而起，立于半空之中。混元子，火麒麟等则是放下手中物事，围将上来。¤You remove the iron sword from behind your back and hand it to the White Emperor with solemnity. The White Emperor took the iron sword and soared up in mid-air with his foot on a Sword Qi. The Huan Yuan Zi, the Fire Qilin and the others put down their hands and gathered around them.
其他几位化神修士默契地退出乌云的范围，你也有条不紊的跟了上去。¤Several other Deity Transformation cultivators tacitly exit the range of the dark clouds and you follow in an orderly fashion.
闭嘴，还轮不到你在这里说话。¤Shut up, it's not your turn to talk here.
血亢剑仙面色一沉，看着从四面合围而来的宁州化神强者们一言不发，不知在想些什么。¤The Blood Hyper Sword Immortal's face sank as he looked at the Ning Province Deity Transformation powerhouses who were closing in from all sides without saying a word, not knowing what he was thinking.
血河可能是在场魔门中最弱的化神，但他毕竟也是一个化神修士。本就不占上风的正道正道修士们渐渐开始支撑不住。¤Blood River might be the weakest Deity Transformation among the Demon Sects present, but he was still a Deity Transformation practitioner after all. The Just Dao cultivators who were already not in the upper hand gradually began to be unable to support themselves.
白帝说得是掷地有声，其上方的晴空却无声地被乌云遮蔽了去。¤The white emperor spoke with a voice, but the clear sky above him was silently obscured by dark clouds.
天雷劫？¤Heavenly thunderbolt?
这...这难道是心魔劫？¤Is this... Could this be a heart attack?
他身旁的火麒麟却是撇了撇嘴，似乎不是很服气的样子。¤The Fire Qilin beside him, however, bristled, seemingly not very convinced.
{size=31}很久未能见到凌老头一展身手了，若是那些魔门不来捣乱，就这么看着他渡劫倒也不错哈哈哈。{/size}¤{size=31}It's been a long time since I've seen old man Ling show off his skills, and it would be nice if those demon clans didn't come and cause trouble and just watch him go through the tribulation hahaha. {/size}
嘁...没想到那白帝竟然会引来心魔劫，我看他是没什么余力再管别人了。¤Ch... I didn't expect that White Emperor to attract the Heart Demon Tribulation, I don't think he has much left to care about others.
眼看劫云就要凝聚完成，只见白帝又是凝聚出数道巨大剑芒，迎着正要落下的雷劫向劫云挥去。一时间，天地灵气急切的流转起来。¤Seeing that the tribulation cloud was about to be completed, I saw Emperor Bai condense several more huge sword rays and swing them at the tribulation cloud as it was about to fall. For a moment, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth flowed eagerly.
天魔道的二位尊者看的也够久了，莫非真的以为我们血剑宫会自大到与他们拼个两败俱伤，让你们得利？¤The two Venerable Masters of the Heavenly Demon Dao have watched long enough. Do you really think that our Blood Sword Palace will be so arrogant as to fight them to a standstill and let you reap the benefits?
若是二位能助我血剑宫夺下白帝手中的这柄戮仙剑，那我便用绝仙剑与二位交换，如何？¤If you two can help my Blood Sword Palace seize this Immortal Executing Sword in the hands of the White Emperor, then I will exchange it with you two for the Absolute Immortal Sword, how about that?
第二道要来了。¤The second course is coming.
随着碰撞之下的余烟散去，一行三人的身影出现在远处.¤As the smoke from the collision cleared, a group of three figures appeared in the distance.
明山的语气中透露着惊讶，你看向混元子，发现他的表情也严肃了起来。¤Ming Shan's tone reveals his surprise, and you look to the mixer to find that his expression has also turned serious.
哈哈哈，金虹的闷瓶子脾气还挺大，本座欣赏你。¤Hahahaha, Golden Rainbow's bored bottle has quite a temper, this seat appreciates you.
哼，大言不惭...¤Hm, big talk...
这吞吐着雷光的乌云像是有了意识一般，在你们退后时飞速扩张，扩张的方向之精准，速度之快，像是要把你们留在劫云中似的。¤This dark cloud straining with lightning seems to have a consciousness, expanding rapidly as you retreat, expanding with such precision and speed that it looks as if it wants to keep you in the cloud of robbery.
未停歇太久，劫云又是雷芒闪耀，隐有蓄力待发之势。¤Before resting for too long, the thundercloud shone again, with a vague tendency to build up its strength.
此言一出，连生性洒脱的明山散人也大为恼火。但还未等他说完，此前一言不发的白鹿真人竟第一个冲了出去。¤At these words, even the spontaneous Ming Shan Sanshou was greatly annoyed. But before he could finish his sentence, the previously silent White Deer was the first to rush out.
至于你，虽然飞行速度不及几位化神前辈，但劫云明显对你没啥兴致，只是平稳且慢速地往这边蔓延着。¤As for you, although your flight speed is not as fast as that of a few senior Deity Transformation, the robbery clouds are clearly not interested in you, and are only spreading smoothly and slowly this way.
正在你与白帝交谈的短短几瞬之间，天空瞬间暗了下来，方圆数百里的海域都被这漆黑的劫云所笼罩。¤In the few short moments between your conversation with the White Emperor, the sky darkens instantly, and the sea for hundreds of miles around is enveloped by this pitch-black robbery cloud.
{size=31}哈哈哈，不愧是凌老儿，竟然选择用这种方式来应对，了不起！{/size}¤{size=31}Hahahaha, worthy of old Ling, to choose to respond in this way, remarkable! {/size}
被剑气劈散的天雷劫威能大减，零星的几下也被白帝的灵气护罩轻松挡了下来。你看到白帝依然淡然自若的神态，也不由得松了口气。¤The heavenly thunderclap that was split apart by the Sword Qi was greatly reduced in power, and the few sporadic strikes were easily blocked by Emperor Bai's aura shield. You can't help but be relieved to see Emperor Bai's still calm and collected demeanour.
{size=31}红莲尊者，修煞尊者...你们两个老家伙还真是阴魂不散啊。{/size}¤{size=31}Venerable Red Lotus, Venerable Cultivating Fury... You two old guys are really shady. {/size}
天空中，刚刚消散的劫云又开始旋转着聚拢起来，一道道紫色的电蛇在劫云中蜿蜒曲折。¤In the sky, the clouds of tribulation that had just dissipated began to swirl and gather again, and a purple snake of lightning snaked through them.
{size=31}哟，这不血亢老狗嘛，当年追着凌老头来中州却像败家之犬一样离开，那个狼狈的样子啊，哪怕是几百年过去我也还没忘呢，哈哈哈哈！{/size}¤{size=31}Yo, if it isn't the old dog Blood Hyper, who chased old man Ling to Central State but left like a defeated dog, that wretched look, I still haven't forgotten it even after hundreds of years, hahahahaha! {/size}
凌轩是剑修，自然要用剑修的方式渡劫。靠着灵气护罩硬抗，本就不是他该做的事。¤Ling Xuan was a sword cultivator, so naturally he had to use the sword cultivator's way to cross the tribulation. Relying on his aura shield to resist hard would not have been something he should have done.
居于其下的白帝则是没什么变化，倒是那层灵气护罩不知怎的消失在了雷劫之下，让他的身影愈发的清晰了起来。¤The White Emperor, who lived below him, was unchanged, but the aura shield had somehow disappeared under the thunderstorm, making his figure more and more visible.
我拖住那只麒麟，玄道宗的老头交给你。剩下的那几个，不足为虑。¤I'll stall that Qilin, and leave the old man from the Mystic Dao Sect to you. The rest of them are not enough to worry about.
古籍中有所记录的雷劫便有十余种，需要应对的方式各不相同，谁也不知道自己在飞升时要面对的是什么雷劫。¤There are more than ten types of lightning tribulation recorded in ancient texts, and the ways in which they need to be dealt with vary.
没想到凡人吃的那些海鲜也能修练成凶兽，听说有位化神期的海上霸主竟是章鱼呢！¤Unexpectedly, the seafood eaten by mortals can also be cultivated into fierce beasts. I heard that there is an Deity Transformation octopus who is the overlord of the sea!
用神识刺激他一下试试？¤Try to stimulate him with soul sense?
倪兄快醒醒！我刚用藏宝图找到天道源丹了！还有好多其他的珍稀丹药！¤Brother Ni, wake up! I just used the treasure map to find the Heavenly Dao Source Pill! There are many other rare Pills!
我刚才好像受到了神识攻击，然后就...之后我也不知道了。¤I seem to have just been attacked by soul sense, and then... I don't know after that.
珍惜丹药！天道源丹！在哪？¤Precious Pill! The Heavenly Dao Origin Pill! Where is it?
嗯，倪兄所言极是。¤Well, what brother Ni said is very true.
倪旭欣刚喊完，像是明白了什么似的讪笑了两下，便没再说什么。¤Ni XuXin just shouted, as if understanding what snapped two smiles, then did not say anything.
唔，倪兄，我刚才是...被古树打晕了？¤Well, brother Ni, I was just... Knocked out by the ancient tree?
之前的神识攻击虽然挺棘手，倒还没到危险的地步，我们小心些继续前进吧。¤The previous soul sense attack was tricky, but not dangerous enough, let's be careful and move on.
倪兄快醒醒！奇怪，刚才那下应该打醒他了才对，难道用力过猛了？¤Brother Ni, wake up! Strange, that should have woken him up just now, did he use too much force?
哎，没事，只是接下来就要更加小心些，要是再来两次我可承受不起。¤The next step is to be more careful, if I can't afford two more.
那，难道是陷入幻觉了么。真是对不住倪兄了。¤Then, is it caught in an illusion. I'm really sorry for Brother Ni.
还...还以为要死在你手上呢，{FirstName}{xiongdi}你怎么突然对我出手？¤Also... Thought I was going to die in your hands, {FirstName}{xiongdi} how did you suddenly strike at me?
醒醒，倪兄醒醒。¤Wake up, brother Ni wake up.
（难道是控制或制造幻觉一类的神通？）¤（Could it be a divine ability to control or create illusions?
倪兄？你怎会在此？¤Brother Ni? What are you doing here?
倪兄你不是先走了么？我只是在攻击古树的根须而已啊？¤Brother Ni, didn't you leave first? I was just attacking the roots of the tree, right?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}可能是陷入了幻觉吧，所以接下来的探索我们可得小心些了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}may be caught in a hallucination, so the next exploration we have to be more careful.
你硬抗根须一记攻击，正待抓住时机斩断根须，却是蓦地神魂一震。赶紧调整好状态再准备以神通攻击时，身前的目标竟变成了倪少。¤You resist the root beard an attack, is about to seize the opportunity to cut off the root beard, but suddenly the soul a shock. Hurry to adjust the state again ready to attack with divine power, the target in front of the body actually became Ni less.
倪兄刚才是怎么了？¤What happened to Brother Ni just now?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}快醒醒。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}Wake up quickly.
嗯？嗯，对对对，还好我及时赶到了。¤Hmm? Well, yes, yes, yes, it's good that I arrived in time.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}一直在与我战斗。自我们靠近古树到现在，它都没有动过。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} has been fighting with me. It hasn't moved since we approached the ancient tree until now.
多谢倪兄，但我恍惚记得那古树根须好像还会天剑...¤Thank you, Brother Ni, but I vaguely remember that the ancient tree roots seem to still have the Heavenly Sword...
刚刚比试的结果都已经出来了，那么第四轮比试，就由星河的{FirstName}{LastName}对阵星河剑派的白露。¤The results of the competition just now have come out, so in the fourth round of the competition, Galaxy's {FirstName}{LastName} will face the Galaxy Sword Sect's Bailu.
那些莫非都是...天道树的根须？¤Could those be... The roots of the Tendo Tree?
你小心翼翼的向漩涡深处探去，不知不觉间已经触达了海底。¤You poke cautiously deeper into the whirlpool, unaware that you have touched the bottom.
这些根须有的已经完全裸露在外，还有些则大半掩埋于地下，有的细如藤蔓，有的又有四五人难以合抱的粗细，互相纠缠在一起，宛若一张大网。¤Some of these roots are completely exposed, while others are half buried in the ground, some as thin as vines, others as thick as four or five people, entangled in each other like a large net.
上次与倪旭欣来到此地时，还未曾留意。但此时你细心观察之下，却发现那些蜿蜒曲折的海底沟壑，实则都来自同一个方向。¤The last time I came here with Ni XuXin, I hadn't noticed. But at this point, when you look closely, you realise that all those winding submarine gullies are actually coming from the same direction.
周围的雾气渐渐散了...¤The fog is gradually dissipating...
先前我师兄来到千流岛参与此擂台，虽是得到了修炼功法的机会，但不知为何性格也变得强硬了许多......¤Before my senior came to Qianliu Island to participate in this arena. Although he was given the opportunity to practice the exercises, his personality has become a lot tougher for some reason...
路旁有一块奇石会吸收你的神念，在释放而出，受此启发，你对神之道有所感悟。¤There is a strange stone on the roadside that will absorb your divine thoughts and release them. Inspired by this, you have an understanding of the way of God.
路旁熔火生生不息，你对火之道有所感悟。¤The melting fire on the roadside is endless, you have an understanding of the way of fire.
路旁地形甚是奇特，灵气流动不断轮转，生生不息，受此启发，你对气之道有所感悟。¤The terrain on the roadside is very peculiar, and the aura flows continuously and endlessly. Inspired by this, you have an understanding of the way of qi.
路旁有一道裂隙，宛若一道剑痕，你对剑之道有所感悟。¤There is a fissure on the roadside, like a sword mark, you have a sense of the way of the sword.
路旁藤蔓枯萎生长，轮回交替不止，你对木之道有所感悟。¤The vines on the roadside wither and grow, and the cycle of reincarnation does not stop. You have an understanding of the woods.
路旁水流奔腾不息，你对水之道有所感悟。¤The water is rushing along the road, and you have an understanding of the way of water.
路旁金石甚是锐利，你对金之道有所感悟。¤The gold stones on the roadside are very sharp. You have an understanding of the way of gold.
路旁山石散去化沙，你对土之道有所感悟。¤The rocks on the side of the road disperse to melt the sand, you have an understanding of the way of the earth.
不知宗门内是否也遭到魔门迫害...我们要抓紧时间回到宗门调查此事。¤I don't know if the sect has also been persecuted by the demon... we must hurry back to the sect to investigate this matter.
在下在此谢过道友，实不相瞒，这储物袋内本也没什么值钱的东西。¤I would like to thank my fellow daoists here. It's true that there is nothing valuable in this storage bag.
李青麟当着你的面打开了储物袋，里面整齐地摆放着许多竹山宗道袍。¤Li Qinglin opened the storage bag in front of you, and there are many robes of Bamboo Mountain Sect neatly placed inside.
此行竹山宗伤亡惨重，我还要清点损失，望道友见谅。¤This trip to Bamboo Mountain Sect has suffered heavy casualties, and I still have to count the losses. I hope friends will forgive me.
就在那空间裂隙中，我拾起储物袋时见你已经离去，便擅自替你保存了一阵。¤Just in the gap in that space, when I picked up the storage bag, I saw that you had already left, so I kept it for you for a while without authorization.
此物确是我不慎遗落于古迹中的，不知道友是何时发现的？¤This thing is indeed left in the monument by accident. I don't know when you found it?
这还是当年我未结丹时留作纪念的储物袋，真是多谢道友帮忙找回，这枚丹药便当做谢礼聊表心意吧，哈哈。¤This is still the storage bag that I kept as a souvenir when I didn't settle the pill. I really thank my fellow daoists for helping to retrieve it. This medicinal pill should be used as a thank-you gift, haha.
你将先前在战场外围拾到的储物袋出示给李青麟，他一向儒雅随和的面孔流露出几分尴尬的神色。¤You showed Li Qinglin the storage bag you found on the periphery of the battlefield. His always elegant and easygoing face showed a bit of embarrassment.
这就是得罪我们禾山道的下场！¤This is the fate of offending us Heshan Road!
这人还有点本事，哼，下次做足了准备再来收拾他！¤This person is still a little capable, huh, next time you are ready to clean him up!
无主之物能者得之，{xiaozi}东西拿出来。¤Things that have no owner can get them, {xiaozi} take things out.
不自量力。¤I can't help myself.
原来是{FirstName}{gongzi}，那此物就让与你，我就先告辞了。¤It turned out to be {FirstName}{gongzi}, then this thing will let you, and I will leave first.
恭喜前辈得此机缘，晚辈告退。¤Congratulations to the seniors for this opportunity, the juniors retire.
这{$Var}倒也别有洞天，没想到深处竟还有一个看似废弃的洞府。¤This {$Var} doesn't have a cave. I didn't expect that there is a seemingly Abandoned Abode in the depths.
原来早有前辈发现此地。¤It turns out that seniors have discovered this place long ago.
哼，算你{xiaozi}识相。¤Hmph, count you {xiaozi} acquainted.
这是后面响起人声，你显然不是发现此地的唯一一人。¤This is the sound of a voice from behind, and you are obviously not the only one who found this place.
原来是{FirstName}前辈。¤It turned out to be senior {FirstName}.
你来到了一处看似藏经阁的房间。¤You came to a room that looked like a Buddhist scripture pavilion.
正当你考虑是否强行破阵闯入时，一人从建筑中走出，与你迎面撞上。见到你这陌生人他也是一愣，尔后便是驱动神通向你攻来。¤Just when you were considering whether to forcefully break in, someone walked out of the building and collided with you head-on. He was also stunned when he saw you, a stranger, and then he drove the supernatural power to attack you.
正当你找到阵法薄弱处准备潜入时，一人从建筑中走出，与你迎面撞上。见到你这陌生人他也是一愣，然后便是驱动神通向你攻来。¤Just when you found the weak point of the formation and were about to sneak in, a person walked out of the building and collided with you head-on. He was also stunned when he saw you, a stranger, and then he drove the magic power to attack you.
想不到这杀手藏匿废弃洞府之中，还在近些日子里提升至金丹后期修为。好在你反应及时才没让其偷袭得逞，反倒是倚仗自身强大的实力将其击毙。¤I didn't expect this killer to be hiding in an Abandoned Abode, but in recent days, he has raised his cultivation level to late Jindan. It was only when you reacted in time that you did not let him succeed in his sneak attack, but instead relied on your own great strength to kill him.
你快速击晕他后，顺手掏走储物袋。¤After you stun him quickly, you take out the storage bag.
在刚才的战斗中，近旁的阵法都已是被击破。其中一幢建筑飘散出浓烈的酒香，料想便是公孙府酒窖了。¤In the battle just now, the formations nearby were all broken. One of the buildings exudes a strong aroma of wine, which is expected to be the wine cellar of Gongsun Mansion.
此处果然是公孙家酒窖，你随手挑了两坛品质上佳的盈手露藏入储物袋中，便是趁无人发现时扬长而去。¤This is indeed the wine cellar of Gongsun's family. You picked two jars of high-quality handmade dew and hid them in the storage bag, and then went away when no one noticed.
潜入公孙府后，由于阵道领悟不足，你很快便是陷入幻阵之中。乱逛一会后，来到一幢较大的建筑旁。¤After sneaking into the Gongsun Mansion, due to the lack of understanding of the formation path, you soon fell into an illusion. After wandering around for a while, I came to a larger building.
（这应该就是公孙府的叛徒了。赶紧回去找公孙季吧。）¤(This must be the traitor of the Gongsun House. Hurry back and find Gongsun Ji.)
随意挑了两坛品质上佳的盈手露后，你趁着没人赶到现场，迅速离去了。¤After randomly picking two jars of high-quality Yingshoulu, you left quickly when no one arrived at the scene.
但袋中只有一本从未听说过的功法。¤But in the bag there was only one book of exercises that had never been heard of before.
只见原本脸上挂满笑容的林沐心逐渐严肃起来，待她再次开口时，已是满脸愤怒。¤I saw that Lin Muxin, who had always had a smile on her face, gradually became serious, and when she spoke again, her face was full of anger.
好，有你助力肯定会轻松上不少。¤Well, with your help, it will definitely be a lot easier.
算你识相，嘿嘿。¤Count your acquaintances, hehe.
倒是我晋升元婴期后常常为家族事务所缚，与宫主的联系淡了不少。¤On the contrary, after I was promoted to the Yuan Ying stage, I was often bound for the family affairs, and the connection with the palace master faded a lot.
上次事件后，宫主倒是提过想收我为弟子，也不知是认真的还是开玩笑。¤After the last incident, the palace master mentioned that he wanted to accept me as a disciple, but he didn't know if he was serious or just joking.
一时间林府长老堂竟成了你们俩个高阶修士挠痒打闹的场所，原本严肃的场合如今满溢着的欢乐气息更是令人咂舌。¤For a while, the Elder Hall of the Lin Mansion has become a place for you two high-ranking cultivators to scratch their heads.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，宫主刚神识传音说发现冲虚散人勾结魔教，且后者正在逃窜，要我循她留下的神识印记前去围剿。¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, the palace master Gang Divine Consciousness said that he found that Chongxu Sanren colluded with the demon sect, and the latter was fleeing, and asked me to follow the Divine Consciousness mark she left to encircle and suppress it.
还好你作为修士听力非常人可比，在这种情况下依旧能听出她说的是星宫宫主陨落了。¤Fortunately, as a cultivator, your hearing is very comparable. In this case, you can still hear what she said is that the Palace Lord of the Star Palace has fallen.
听到你的话语声，林沐心才慢慢地抬起头来，却见她脸色惨白，眼角依稀挂着泪痕，更是紧咬这下唇，令原本晶莹的芳唇也是透出丝丝凄红。¤Hearing your words, Lin Muxin slowly raised her head, only to see her face pale, with tears in the corners of her eyes.
你们平时都在天星城，不是应该经常会见到么。¤You are usually in Tianxing City, shouldn't you see each other often?
趁林沐心开口说话时，你也抓住时机奋起反抗。¤When Lin Muxin spoke, you also seized the opportunity to fight back.
不好说，但...要见到她们比见到宫主还要难。¤It's hard to say, but... it's harder to see them than the palace master.
好了，好了，我认输，沐心仙子赢了。¤Alright, alright, I admit defeat, Fairy Muxin wins.
据说平时他除了出门游历就是修炼，也没再想找林家麻烦。¤It is said that in addition to going out and traveling, he is cultivating, and he does not want to trouble the Lin family anymore.
当时我以为这事就这么过去了，结果过了约摸三十年，冲虚散人又主动找宫主承担元婴长老一职，之后也是对此尽职尽责，乃至更胜其师父一筹。¤At the time, I thought this was over, but after about 30 years, Chongxu Sanren took the initiative to ask the Palace Master to assume the role of Nascent Soul Elder. After that, he also fulfilled his duties and even surpassed his master.
宫主...{size=28}她...{/size}{size=26}陨落...{/size}{size=24}了...{/size}¤Palace Master...{size=28}She...{/size}{size=26}fall...{/size}{size=24}...{/size}
嗯，那我便先动身了。¤Well, then I'll go first.
嗯？宫主的亲传弟子？姓星的话可能是宫主家族中人。但说到弟子...无惑真人以前一直希望宫主收弟子来着，但未能如愿。¤Ok? The direct disciple of the Palace Master? If the surname is Xing, it may be a member of the palace lord's family. But when it comes to disciples... Real Master Wuhuo had always hoped that the Palace Master would accept disciples, but he was unable to do so.
那...{$Lin}找过星铃儿么，她作为宫主弟子应该知道更多信息才对。¤Then... {$Lin} has found Xing Ling'er, as a disciple of the Palace Master, she should know more information.
一句话还未说完，林沐心竟已是泣不成声，又将头埋在自己的臂弯里。¤Before she could finish her sentence, Lin Muxin was already sobbing and buried her head in her arms.
有谈论过，但没什么头绪。¤There was talk, but no clue.
会不会是因为{$Lin}去星宫太少，所以刚好都错过了。¤Could it be because {$Lin} went to the star palace too little, so I just missed it all.
上次留下的神识创伤还没好利落吧，怎么就开始忙碌了？¤The spiritual trauma left by the last time has not been neat, so why are you busy?
所以后来若是没什么大事，我很少去星宫，见到他的次数也就很少了。¤So if there is no major event later, I rarely go to the star palace, and the number of times I see him is very small.
那宫主的道侣呢，会不会对冲虚散人的事也有了解?¤As for the Taoist Companion of the Palace Master, will they also understand the matter of the vain people?
好啦好啦，反正冲虚散人没找我们麻烦，不用管他。¤Alright, alright, anyway, Chongxu Sanren didn't trouble us, don't worry about him.
是啊，和逍遥剑仙并称移动人形天灾的沐心仙子，可不是享有盛...哈，哈哈，你怎么还动手的，哈哈哈...¤Yes, Fairy Muxin, who is also known as the moving human disaster, is not enjoying prosperity... Ha, ha ha, how do you still do it? ha ha ha...
这转变是挺奇怪的，他可不像是能放下的类型。¤It's a strange change, he doesn't seem like the type to let go.
任你再询问什么，林沐心也只是低头不语，你也只得安慰她一番后起身离去。¤No matter what you ask, Lin Muxin just bows her head and doesn't say a word, you can only comfort her before leaving.
没办法，谁让我是林家最勤劳的小蜜蜂呢。¤No way, who made me the most industrious little bee in the Lin family?
冲虚散人...也许是他吧。从上次事件后我都没怎么见过他。¤Chongxu Sanren... Maybe it's him. I haven't seen him much since the last incident.
眼见林沐心对这小小的胜利心满意足，你将话题转到之前的探索上。¤Seeing that Lin Muxin is satisfied with this small victory, you turn the topic to the previous exploration.
唔，她好像是一直在外游历，都没怎么在星宫见过，我每次去都只见到了宫主。¤Well, it seems that she has been traveling abroad, and she has never seen it in the Star Palace. Every time I go, I only see the Palace Master.
哟，忙着呢？¤Yo, are you busy?
应该不会，我还在金丹期时，因为父亲日常闭关的缘故，所以总是去打扰宫主，她也会很亲切地指点我的修炼。¤Probably not. When I was still in the Jindan period, because of my father's daily retreat, I always bothered the palace master, and she would also kindly give me guidance on my cultivation.
这一系列转变还真是奇怪，你和通羽大长老之后没谈论过此事么？¤This series of changes is really strange. Haven't you talked about it with the elder Tongyu?
哼，我就动手，让你瞎说，让你再瞎说！¤Hmph, I'll do it, let you talk nonsense, let you talk nonsense again!
只是刚好想起而已。¤Just just remembered.
唔，之前我在星宫战胜冲虚后，看到宫主身旁跟着一个年轻女修，好像叫星铃儿，感觉是宫主的亲传弟子，{$Lin}没有询问过她么？¤Well, after I defeated Chongxu in Xinggong before, I saw a young female cultivator next to the palace lord. She seemed to be called Xing Linger.
我后来想了想，上次从那元婴妖兽洞窟出来见到的修士，好像是冲虚散人。¤I thought about it later, the cultivator I saw last time I came out of the Nascent Soul Monster Beast Cave seemed to be a person who rushed to the void.
见林沐心御空而去，你选择回客房修炼。¤Seeing Lin Muxin leave in the sky, you choose to go back to the guest room to practice.
本来应该是这样，而且我后来还经常去星宫。但这冲虚散人被他师父关了近百年禁闭后，一转之前的性格，变得...嗯，变得非常的低调。¤It was supposed to be like this, and I often went to the Star Palace afterwards. But after this Chongxu Sanren was imprisoned by his master for nearly a hundred years, his character before a change has become... um, very low-key.
你才是老妖怪，我可是在宁州修仙界享有盛名的沐心仙子。¤You are the old monster! I am the Muxin Fairy who is well-known in the Ning Province Immortal Cultivation World.
倒是无惑真人陨落后出现过一个小插曲。¤However, there was a small episode after the death of Wuhuo Zhenren.
哟，原来{$Lin}是只老妖怪级别的蜜蜂啊，可让我长见识了。¤Oh, it turns out that {$Lin} is an old monster-level bee, I've learned a lot today!
她们...¤They...
{$Lin},还顺利么？¤{$Lin}, how are you doing?
这样么...算了，只要冲虚散人不跳出来找事，也没必要管他。¤So... Forget it, as long as Chongxu Sanren doesn't jump out to find trouble, there's no need to care about him.
约摸三天过去，你感应到林沐心的神识波动出现在林府，这才浅吐一口浊气，将四肢百骸中按功法路线运行的浓稠灵气液收归丹田。而后则是悠闲地走向大殿。¤After about three days, you sensed Lin Muxin's consciousness fluctuations appearing in the Lin Mansion, and only then did you take a sigh of turbid air and return the thick spiritual qi liquid running along the line of the exercises in the limbs to Dantian. Then he walked leisurely towards the main hall.
一迈入长老堂就看见疲惫不堪的林沐心正趴在桌上，甚至不是经历一场持续多天的战斗所能带来的疲惫。¤As soon as he stepped into the presbytery, he saw the exhausted Lin Muxin lying on the table, not even the exhaustion that could be brought about by a battle that lasted for many days.
说起来，上次从那元婴妖兽洞窟出来时，我见到的那个修士好像冲虚散人。¤Speaking of which, when I came out of the Nascent Soul Monster Beast Cave last time, the cultivator I saw seemed to be rushing towards the void.
当时是无惑真人寿尽后不久，宫主见冲虚散人诚心思过百年，想让他接受无惑真人的权责，但不知为何两人起了矛盾。¤At that time, shortly after the real person Wuhuo died, the palace master saw that Chongxu Sanren had been sincere for a hundred years and wanted him to accept the power and responsibility of the real person Wuhuo, but for some reason the two had a conflict.
你这是...¤You are...
起初通羽大长老还有些不信他改邪归正了，但这些年一直相安无事，由不得我们不信，所以后来也就没怎么关注冲虚的事了。¤At first, the elder Tongyu still didn't believe that he had changed his wickedness and returned to the righteous, but these years have been peaceful, and we can't help not believe it, so later we didn't pay much attention to the matter of Chongxu.
发生了什么？¤what happened?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}果然好身手。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} is really good at it.
可惜可惜，我还没有施展我的独门剑招，否则早就将此魔剑拿下了！¤It's a pity, I haven't used my unique sword trick, otherwise I would have taken this magic sword long ago!
既然道友不是这样想的，那便多谢带来消息，你我就此别过！¤Since you do not think so, then thanks for bringing the news, you and I will say goodbye!
林沐心听到一半时已是双唇紧抿，待你复述林沐雪的决意时，更是贝齿紧咬下唇。分不出是红唇原本就如此诱人，还是因为太过用力，渗出些许血珠染红了这双唇。¤Lin MuXin heard half when already lips pursed, to be you repeat Lin Mu Xue's determination, more shellfish teeth tightly bite the lower lip. It is not clear whether the red lips were originally so attractive, or because of too much force, seeping out a few beads of blood stained the lips.
林姑娘，这便是全部了。¤Miss Lin, that's all.
事到如今，道友是打算继续帮我...还是...更赞同姐姐的决定呢？¤Now, do you want to continue to help me... Or... Do you agree more with my sister's decision?
你虽已是讲述完，林沐心却还是沉浸于中，久久未能自拔。¤Although you are finished telling, Lin MuXin is still immersed in the, a long time can not extricate themselves.
林姑娘打算如何引开两位长老呢？¤How does Miss Lin plan to lure away the two elders?
你一时不知如何回答林沐心是好，一方面你确实偏向林沐雪的做法，另一方面又不想过于为难林沐心，只好保持沉默。¤You momentarily do not know how to answer Lin MuXin is good, on the one hand you do favor Lin Mu Xue's approach, on the other hand do not want to be too difficult for Lin MuXin, so you have to remain silent.
两天后。¤Two days later.
嗯，我只需每隔一段时间暴露自己的气息，然后再次隐去气息远遁到城市另一角，引他四处奔走，想必能拖上一会。¤Well, I just need to expose their breath every so often, and then again hide their breath far away to another corner of the city, to lead him around, I think I can drag on for a while.
我们只有一次行动机会，还是先静修一番调整状态吧。刚好也可以让他们先花些时间寻找我的行踪，当他们因久寻不得而焦躁时，就是我们最好的行动机会。¤We only have one chance to act, or first meditate a bit to adjust the state of it. It's just as well that they can spend some time looking for my whereabouts first. When they get anxious because they can't find me for a long time, that's our best chance to act.
多谢{FirstName}道友，那大长老那边呢，有消息么？¤Thanks {FirstName} fellow Daoist, what about the Grand Elder's side, any news?
嗯，我只需过两日表现得急于出城，借此卖个破绽，定会有鱼上钩。之后再凭法宝隐去气息远遁城市另一角，引他四处奔走，想必能拖上一会。¤The first thing you need to do is to show your eagerness to get out of the city in two days, so that you can sell a broken story, there will be fish on the hook. After that, then with magic treasures to hide the breath far away from the other corner of the city, leading him to run around, I think it will be able to drag on for a while.
嘿嘿，还是通羽长老疼我。那我们只要找个机会把二长老和三长老引开，然后就可以潜入他们的居所调查了。有通羽爷爷的照应，肯定不会暴露的。¤Hey hey, or Tong Yu elder love me. Then we just need to find an opportunity to lure the second and third elders away, and then we can sneak into their residence to investigate. With Grandpa Tong Yu's care, it will definitely not be exposed.
林姑娘稍等，我这还有来自林沐雪姑娘的消息。¤Miss Lin wait a moment, I still have news from Miss Lin Mu Xue here.
林家为何会经常与星宫其他派系联姻？¤Why does the Lin family often associate with other factions of the Star Palace?
嗯，有劳{FirstName}道友了。¤Well, I'm grateful to {FirstName} fellow Daoist.
你将林沐雪的心意全盘托出。¤You tell Lin Mu Xue's heart in full.
林姑娘，我不...¤Miss Lin, I don't...
多谢{FirstName}道友，既然还有这种变故，那我们还是尽快启动计划为好，不然...¤Thanks {FirstName}Daoist, since there is still this kind of change, it is better for us to start the plan as soon as possible, otherwise...
应该是双修秘术的原因吧，据说是星宫双圣为防双修秘术外传而立下的规矩。但父亲说老祖并不想强迫后人修习此等秘术，所以只需放弃秘术的修炼资格，便可以在找道侣一事上随意而为。¤It is said that the two saints of the Star Palace made the rules to prevent the secret art of dual cultivation from spreading. But the father said the old ancestor did not want to force descendants to practice these secret arts, so just give up the Aptitude of the secret art practice, you can do whatever you want in the matter of finding a Daoist partner.
你将通羽上人的承诺转告林沐心。\t¤You will pass on Lord Tong Yu's promise to Lin MuXin. \t
林姑娘，我不是这个意思...但还是不要辜负你姐姐的一片苦心...¤Miss Lin, that's not what I meant... But still don't let down your sister's kindness...
随着你的诉说，林沐心此前挂在脸上的期待与焦急慢慢转变为喜悦。让你觉得眼前哪是那个为联姻担心焦虑的林府二小姐，不过是个雀跃的少女。¤As you speak, Lin MuXin previously hung on the face of the expectation and anxiety slowly transformed into joy. It makes you feel that the second young lady of the Lin House, who is worried and anxious about the marriage, is just a young girl who is leaping for joy.
林姑娘放心。¤Miss Lin rest assured.
也不知冲虚老鬼什么时候会与姐姐结为道侣，不如现在就开始行动吧。¤I also don't know when the Patriarch Chong Xu will form a Daoist couple with sister, so why don't we start acting now?
{FirstName}道友，可有消息？¤{FirstName}Daoist friend, do you have any news?
林沐心一愣，显然是没想到还有其他消息，还是来自平时很疼爱自己，很包容自己小脾气的姐姐。¤Lin MuXin was stunned, apparently not expecting any other news, or from his sister who usually loves him and is very tolerant of his little temper.
你只得叹了口气，将杂念剔除后，坐下修炼，静等封城解除。¤You can only sigh, remove the distracting thoughts, sit down to practice, and wait for the closure of the city to be lifted.
林姑娘是说以自身为饵，钓那位收了好处的长老出来？¤Miss Lin is saying that she will use herself as bait to catch the elder who has received the benefit to come out?
花了几息时间整理好情绪后，林沐心才向你点点头示意可以开始说了。¤It took a few breaths of time to get organized before Lin MuXin nodded to you to indicate that you could start talking.
只是循环几次后，难免引起怀疑，所以{FirstName}道友届时务必要抓住时机迅速行动。¤Just after cycling a few times, it is inevitable to cause suspicion, so {FirstName} Daoist then be sure to seize the moment to act quickly.
但见你不作言语，林沐心只当你是默认了她的说法。¤But seeing that you did not say anything, Lin MuXin only assumed that you had acquiesced to her statement.
你，也觉得是我任性才...¤You, too, think that I am capricious before...
三长老栖云真人是金丹初期修士，主管家族财务和经营天星城坊市、问道楼等。听说他不但醉心于此道，而且颇有成就。¤The third elder Quyun real person is an early Jindan Vagrant Cultivator, in charge of the family finances and operating the Tianxing City market, ask the Dao building and so on. I heard that he is not only intoxicated with this Dao, but also quite successful.
在你的提醒下，林沐心才意识到自己的失态。¤It was only after your reminder that Lin MuXin realized her outburst.
但不知为何此次也对联姻一事上心异常。¤But I don't know why I'm also interested in the marriage this time.
父亲为寻求突破机会，最近在闭死关。除非是...嗯，我不想向他寻求帮助。若是他强行出关走火入魔...¤Father is recently in a deathly retreat in search of a breakthrough opportunity. Unless it's... Well, I don't want to ask him for help. If he forced himself out of seclusion and went off the rails...
至于大哥...听父亲说是突破金丹后去其他州历练，一直未归。上次见他时，我才开始修炼呢。¤As for big brother... I heard from my father that he went to other states for training after breaking through the Golden Dan and has not returned. The last time I saw him, I had just started cultivating.
除此之外，林家与星宫其他派系的联姻一向也是由他负责。¤In addition, the marriage between the Lin family and other factions of the Star Palace has always been his responsibility.
不等你为自己辩解，林沐心撂下一句满溢不快的感谢便是翻窗而出，在你犹豫要不要追上去时，她已是不知去向。¤The first thing you need to do is to go out of the window with an unpleasant thank you, and when you hesitate to go after her, she is already gone.
两位长老对联姻的态度如此坚决我也是第一次见到。¤The two elders are so resolute about the marriage that it's the first time I've seen it.
那我便现在前往林府外围等候林姑娘创造机会了。¤Then I will now go to the periphery of the Lin House to wait for Miss Lin to create an opportunity.
想到后果，林沐心面色苍白。¤Thinking of the consequences, Lin MuXin's face turned pale.
他们不是很想捉我回去么，我们只需利用一下此事正主的求利心切即可。¤They are very eager to catch me back, we just need to take advantage of this matter is the main profit-seeking heart can.
才进入客房，林沐心已是一脸期待的靠了过来。¤Only when you enter the guest room, Lin MuXin is already leaning over with an expectant face.
二长老苗矮上人是金丹初期修士，平时负责家族弟子的修炼等事项。他不但严格，脾气还很差，林家子弟或多或少有些怕他。¤The second elder, Miao Dwarf, is an early Jindan Vagrant Cultivator who is usually responsible for the cultivation of the family's disciples and other matters. He is not only strict, but also very bad-tempered, and the Lin family's children are more or less afraid of him.
哈哈哈！你此前口口声声地说着“修仙者岂能被他人安排命运”，现如今却也要插手一番我的命运么！¤Hahahaha! You previously said how can an immortal Vagrant Cultivator be destined by others, but now you also want to interfere with my fate!
差不多了，我们准备行动吧。¤It's almost time, let's get ready to move.
那你是打算帮她看着我，不让我做所谓的傻事？¤So you are going to help her watch over me and keep me from doing the so-called stupid things?
{xiaozi}叫我炎鹤大人~¤{Call me Lord Yanhe~
前方一名修士，鬼鬼祟祟神色可疑，你决定...{w}{w=0.5}¤There is a cultivator ahead with a sneaky look and suspicious look, you decide...{w}{w=0.5}
我还是不要多管闲事了。¤I shouldn't be nosy.
{xiaozi}，下辈子别多管闲事。¤{xiaozi}, don't be nosy in your next life.
道友，就由本座来会会你。¤Friends of Taoism, I will meet you from this seat.
道友，上次委托你的任务...？¤Fellow Daoist, the task entrusted to you last time...?
道友若能完成这项委托，不仅能获得{$jiangli}，还能提升道友在此地的声望。¤If Daoists can complete this commission, they will not only get {$jiangli}, but they will also increase the reputation of Daoists here.
租借一次房间需要30灵石，单次使用不限时长，要租借么？{w}{w=0.5}¤It takes 30 spirit stones to rent a room once, and there is no time limit for a single use. Do you want to rent it? {w}{w=0.5}
我对这件事情没有什么兴趣。¤I have no interest in this matter.
没钱...呵呵，那可不行。¤No money...hehe, that won't work.
那就拜托道友了。¤Then please ask fellow daoists.
我们{$miaoshu}¤We {$miaoshu}
很好，那此事就拜托道友了，还请道友务必抓紧时间。¤Very well, then I'll ask fellow daoists for this matter, and fellow daoists must hurry up.
哎...那我也只有另想办法了。¤Hey...then I have to find another way.
这里暂时没有什么需要帮助的事。¤There is nothing to help here at the moment.
桀！桀！桀！桀！¤Jie! Jie! Jie! Jie!
与其他整齐码放在书架上的典籍不同，书桌上整齐地摆放了三个玉简。¤Unlike other books neatly arranged on the shelves, the desk is neatly arranged with three jade slips.
走近一看，分别便是那《鹤喙针》、《飞针术》与《鹤回翔》。自不用说，你迅速将其全部浏览了一遍。¤When you take a closer look, they are the 'Crane Beak Needle', 'Flying Needle' and 'Flying Crane'. It goes without saying that you quickly skimmed through them all.
“能自创出如此玄妙的神通，鹤真人真乃绝世奇才，只可惜……”¤Can create such a subtle divine ability, crane real person is really a great talent, only a pity ......
你来到了一个满是书卷与玉简的房间。¤You arrived at a room filled with scrolls and jade slips.
将其收下后，你又四处寻找了一番，但对你来说全然都是些无用之物。¤After putting it away, you searched around some more, but it was all useless to you.
好了，回去复命吧。¤Alright, go back to life.
嗯，没恢复之前{$Lin}就不要乱跑了。¤Well, {$Lin} don't run around until it recovers.
还不满意嘛，那我在你传音符里留下神识印记吧，这可是我的底线了哦。¤If you're not satisfied, then I'll leave a mark of consciousness in your voice transmission. This is my bottom line.
我刚在那阵法内战斗太久，神识有些受损，也得回去修养一会了。¤I just fought in that formation for too long, and my consciousness was a little damaged, so I have to go back to cultivate for a while.
唔，那就奖励心儿成为我的关门弟子吧，以后心儿要叫鸾儿师姐哦。¤Well, then reward Xin'er for being my close disciple. In the future, Xin'er will be called Senior Sister Luan'er.
好，我会记得的。¤Well, I will remember.
我也说不好，嗯，只能说是有不好的预感。所以若是有需要，记得传音符联系。¤I can't say it well either, um, I can only say that I have a bad premonition. So if you need it, remember to get in touch.
林沐心像是想到了什么，俏脸飞红，而后毫不犹豫地拒绝了宫主的好意。¤Lin Muxin seemed to have thought of something, her pretty face blushed, and then she refused the palace master's kindness without hesitation.
冲着我来？为什么？¤for me? why?
啊对了，这个丹方给你，还有些对应的药材。然后之前鸾儿给过你《神交法》，这本《内照法》也一起给你吧。¤Ah yes, this pill is for you, and there are some corresponding medicinal materials. Then Luan'er gave you the Shenjiao Fa before, so let's give you this Internal Zhao Fa too.
虽说事先已被你破去一角，但你竟能在此等阵法的加持下击败冲虚散人，还真是让我惊讶，不愧让我看好你这么多年，嘻嘻。¤Although you have broken a corner beforehand, you can actually defeat the Chongxu Sanren with the blessing of such a formation, which really surprised me. I deserve to be optimistic about you for so many years, hee hee.
哼，还不是被冲虚散人摆了一道。那阵法应该是出自古神教，专用于克制神魂一道的修士，不但要多位元婴修士为阵基，还内合奇门八卦之形，竟能内蕴一个小的阵法空间。若不是你击杀了作为阵眼的冲虚散人，只怕是要我亲至阵法外才能发觉。¤Hmph, it's not like he was put together by the Chongxu scattered people. That formation should come from the ancient gods, and it was specially used to restrain the cultivators of the soul. Not only did many Nascent Soul cultivators form the foundation of the formation, but it also had the shape of Qimen gossip, so that it could contain a small formation space. If it wasn't for you who killed the Chongxu scattered people who were the eyes of the formation, I am afraid that I would have to go outside the formation to find out.
啊，对了，几大魔教最近动作不小，你在外游历时多加小心，我感觉，他们可能会冲着你来。¤Ah, by the way, several major demon sects have made a lot of moves recently. You should be more careful when you travel abroad. I feel that they may come at you.
你话音刚落，星凝的神识传音就进入脑中。随后她本人也是轻踩莲步而至。¤As soon as your voice fell, Xing Ning's soul sense transmission entered his mind. Then she herself stepped on the lotus lightly.
我就当你夸我咯，嘿嘿。¤I'll take it as you compliment me, hehe.
摊上你这么个聪慧的宫主，星宫弟子们还真是走运呢。¤With such a smart palace lord as you, the disciples of the Star Palace are really lucky.
好了好了，别一副充满怨念的样子，我也不是故意要隐瞒身份的嘛。本只是用来骗无惑和丹阳子的嘻嘻，谁叫他们总是想管着我。¤Okay, don't look full of resentment, I didn't mean to hide my identity. This is just used to deceive Wuyou and Dan Yangzi, who told them that they always want to control me.
你神识既然能覆盖大半个宁州，为啥不在蕊宫仙子重伤时就前往救援？以你的遁速应该早就不过几息之间便能抵达吧？¤Since your consciousness can cover most of Ning Province, why didn't you go to the rescue when Fairy Ruigong was seriously injured? With your escaping speed, you should be able to arrive in a few breaths long ago, right?
嗯，放心吧。{FirstName}{$NickName}也别去太远的地方，每{color=#d0380a}五百年{/color}一开的{color=#d0380a}宁州古迹{/color}还是很有探索价值的。¤Well, don't worry. {FirstName}{$NickName} don't go too far, the {color=#d0380a}Ning Province monuments{/color} open every {color=#d0380a}500 years{/color} are still worth exploring of.
不过你竟能在此等阵法的加持下击败冲虚散人，还真是让我惊讶，不愧让我看好你这么多年，嘻嘻。¤However, you can actually defeat the Chongxu Sanren with the blessing of such a formation, which really surprised me. It is worthy of making me optimistic about you for so many years, hee hee.
别夸我了，如果一开始追杀冲虚的是你，他能不能逃出天星城还是另说呢。¤Don't brag about me, if it was you who chased and killed Chongxu in the first place, whether he could escape from Tianxing City is another matter.
我该去帮鸾儿疗伤了，就不多陪你们啦。¤It's time for me to help Luan'er heal, so I won't accompany you more.
星宫本就以双修闻名，有多个道侣也说得过去。而且，我们还是别议论她了，谁知道她还有些什么鬼点子...¤Xinggong is famous for its double cultivation, and there are many Taoist companions who can make sense. Besides, let's not talk about her, who knows what other crazy ideas she has...
星铃儿指点你修炼？¤Xing Linger instructing you to cultivate?
宫主好意我心领了，还是算了吧...¤The palace lord is kind to me, so let's forget it...
啊，忘了告诉你，星铃儿就是宫主...我也是刚刚知道的！\n¤Ah, I forgot to tell you, Xing Linger is the Palace Master... I just found out too! \n
不敢，别说我，偌大个宁州又有几人敢说你的坏话呢？¤Don't dare, don't talk about me, how many people in Ning Province dare to speak ill of you?
算是吧。以前没见过宫主道侣的时候，只当是笑话，没想到居然是真的。那...宫主有很多道侣的消息说不定也是...¤Forget it. When I hadn't seen the Palace Master Dao Companion before, I thought it was a joke, but I didn't expect it to be true. Then... the news that the palace lord has many Taoist companions may also be...
宫主，那我呢？¤Palace Master, what about me?
父亲真可怜...¤Poor father...
（我的神识不说覆盖整个宁州，但大半个还是没问题的哦，下次别让我抓到你说我坏话。）¤(My consciousness does not say that it covers the entire Ning Province, but most of it is still fine. Don't let me catch you and speak ill of me next time.)
回到星宫后，星凝先是让你们在大殿上稍等，而后便是送蕊宫仙子回房疗伤去了。¤After returning to the Star Palace, Xing Ning first asked you to wait in the main hall, and then sent Fairy Ruigong back to her room for healing.
噗，好好好，我把《星辰神念体》也教你吧，这可是我父亲的独门神通，宁州只此一份。¤Pfft, alright, alright, let me teach you the Star Spiritual Mind, this is my father's unique magical power, and Ning Province only has this one.
因为他们境界不如我咯，化神期和元婴期的差距可是天堑。而且鸾儿又很配合我，所以在她的演技和我的神识伪装相辅相成下，也就骗了他们五六百年吧嘻嘻。¤Because their realm is not as good as mine, the gap between the Deity Transformation stage and the Nascent Soul stage is a natural moat. And Luan'er cooperates very well with me, so with her acting skills and my camouflage complementing each other, she has deceived them for five or six hundred years, hee hee.
他有啥可怜的，真要我坐镇宫中处理事务，肯定还不如鸾儿。这样既承担了宫主的责任，又能让我外出游山玩水，可是双赢哦。¤He is so pitiful, if he really wants me to sit in the palace to handle affairs, it is definitely not as good as Luan'er. This not only takes on the responsibility of the palace master, but also allows me to go out and play in the mountains and waters, but it is a win-win situation.
唉，之前宫主叫我心儿都还没觉得什么，现在总觉得有些奇怪。¤Alas, before the Palace Master called me Xin'er, I didn't feel anything, but now I always feel a little strange.
是因为宫主的道侣蕊宫仙子也是女性么？¤Is it because the palace master's Daolurui Palace fairy is also a woman?
你说，要是你见到的宫主都是蕊宫仙子，那指点我修炼的真会是星铃儿么？¤You said, if all the palace masters you saw were Fairies of Ruigong, would it really be Xing Linger who pointed me to practice?
没想到{$xing}还挺“大方”。¤I didn't expect {$xing} to be quite generous.
不管怎么说，你都是救了我的鸾儿啦，这是你应得的。¤No matter what, you saved my Luan'er, you deserve it.
你和他们二人相识几百年，难道认不出你么？¤You and the two of them have known each other for hundreds of years, don't they recognize you?
凝神查探，你可以看到空中有一团凝而不散的雷云，而一只鲲正在浮于其中与一只雷灵相斗。¤Gaze into the sky and you can see a cloud of thunder that is condensed but not dispersed, and a Kun is floating in it fighting a thunder spirit.
远处雷鸣与兽吼交杂在一起随着阵阵剧烈的灵气波动，向四周荡开。¤In the distance, thunder and beast roars mingle together with violent aura fluctuations, rippling out in all directions.
“轰隆~”¤'Boom~''
一道道天雷落在庞大的躯体后化作一道道雷劲在他体内爆开。不过，在雷云中的鲲已经逐渐适应了落雷的强度，身上的伤口甚至开始缓缓愈合。¤A heavenly thunderbolt fell on the huge body and then turned into a thunderbolt of energy that burst through his body. However, Kun in the thunder cloud had gradually adapted to the intensity of the falling thunder, and the wounds on his body even began to heal slowly.
之后雷灵奈何不得对方便被击散了，而那只鲲也注意到了你，目光冰冷的看着你。¤After that the thunder spirit cannot help the opponent and is scattered, and the kun notices you and looks at you with an icy gaze.
真走运，居然找到了珍贵的四品灵药。¤Fortunately, I found a precious fourth-tier Pill.
多谢各位道友抬爱，在下携带的丹药已经售完，咱们下次再会。¤Thank you all for your kindness, the pills I carry have been sold out, let's meet again next time.
百里奇正与同族中人站在一起商议着什么，还是不要去打扰他了。¤Bailiqi was standing with someone from his clan and discussing something, so he shouldn't bother him.
哼，若魔门来犯宁州，我定叫他有来无回！¤Hmph, if the Demon Sect attacks Ning Province, I will tell him to come back and never return!
而另一边，刚刚就被重伤的赤目老祖也没能冲出公孙府众人布下的阵法，被留了下来。¤On the other side, the Red-eyed Old Man, who had just been seriously injured, also failed to break out of the formation set up by the Gongsun House crowd and was left behind.
而另一边，刚刚就被重伤的赤目老祖没能冲出公孙府众人布下的阵法，被留了下来。¤On the other side, the Red-eyed Old Man, who had just been seriously injured, failed to break out of the formation set up by the Gongsun House crowd and was left behind.
这琚运琦原本就天资极高，否则光凭这秘术，可做不到风雨楼大长老的位置。¤This Ju Yunqi was originally extremely gifted, otherwise with this secret technique alone, he would not have made it to the position of Grand Elder of the Rain and Rain Tower.
要追么？¤Want to chase?
走吧，我们先回风雨楼。¤Come on, let's go back to the Storm House first.
厉害...这琚运琦的秘术还真是不可小觑。¤Amazing... This Ju Yunqi's secret art is really not to be underestimated.
你没能拦下琚运琦，他化作一道紫黑色的遁光，消失不见了。¤You failed to stop Ju Yunqi, who disappeared into a purple-black transported light.
尽管底牌尽出，琚运琦还是没能从你手下逃出。¤Despite all his cards, Ju Yunqi was unable to escape from you.
呼...这琚运琦的秘术还真是不可小觑。¤Hoo... This Ju Yunqi's secret technique is really not to be underestimated.
算了，今日他接连施展秘术，寿元大损，本就活不了多久了。¤Forget about it, today he has performed one secret technique after another and his life expectancy has been greatly damaged, so he will not live much longer.
你谨慎地用神识扫过洞窟，并没有发现有人或妖兽的踪迹。你决定...？¤You cautiously sweep through the cave with your soul sense and find no sign of people or Spirit Beasts. You decide to...?
你刚一走进洞窟，没想到就激活了一处防御法阵。看来这里曾是哪位修士开辟的临时洞府，里面似乎没有人，但法阵灵力犹在，仍可以运转。你决定...？¤As soon as you walked into the cave, you unexpectedly activated a defense spell formation. It seems that this was once a temporary cave opened by one of the cultivators, and there seems to be no one inside, but the spell formation spiritual power is still there and can still operate. You decide...?
此阵布置的颇为精妙，尽管花费了不少时间，但凭你对于布阵之道的粗浅认知实在难以破解此阵。¤The arrangement of this formation is quite delicate, although it took a lot of time, but based on your superficial understanding of the formation of the way, it is really difficult to crack this formation.
此阵布置的颇为精妙，好在你对于御阵之道颇有研究，很快便看出了其中门道。¤The layout of this formation is quite delicate, but fortunately, you have studied the way of the imperial formation, and soon you can see the way.
你精准地毁掉阵眼，关闭阵法的运转，顺利进入了洞府。¤You accurately destroyed the formation eye, shut down the operation of the formation, and entered the cave smoothly.
如此一来，就只有尝试用蛮力破除阵法这一种方案了。¤In this way, the only option is to try to break the formation with brute force.
但即便能够破除阵法，布阵之人想必也可以立刻知晓此事，要冒此风险么？¤But even if the formation can be broken, the people who set up the formation must be able to immediately know about this, do you want to take this risk?
你也是打算出海？我听说无尽之海上有许多陆地上见不到的奇特妖兽，这次出去一定要长长见识。¤You also plan to go out to sea? I heard that there are many strange monsters that you can't see on land in the endless sea. You must have a long experience when you go out this time.
你很强，期待下一次和你切磋。¤You are very strong and look forward to playing with you next time.
弟子恭送师尊。¤The disciple respectfully bids farewell.
哈哈哈，{FirstName}{shidi}，恭喜你夺得本次大比的第一，你这次可谓是名震宗门啊。¤Hahaha, {FirstName}{shidi}, congratulations on your winning the first place in this competition. You can be said to be a famous sect this time.
哈哈哈，不错。你入我门下，本座必会悉心教导你的。\n之前墨景山所用的是《五毒噬心决》，乃是本门地阶毒法，你觉得如何。¤Hahaha, yes. If you enter my school, this seat will teach you carefully. \nBefore Mo Jingshan used Five Poisons Devouring the Heart, which is the local level poison method, what do you think.
可惜...索性这次大比已经拿到了筑基丹，也算有所收获。¤It's a pity... At least I have already obtained the Foundation Pill in this competition, that's something.
作为这次宗门大比的第一，你可以自行选择拜入我派任意一位长老门下。来，我现在便带你前往大殿。¤As the number one in this Zongmen Grand Competition, you can choose to worship any elder Our Sect. Come, I will take you to the main hall now.
若有要事，可来后山寻我。¤If you have something important, you can come to the back mountain to find me.
安心修炼，最好在猎魔试炼之中，为宗门争光。¤Cultivation with peace of mind, it is best to win glory for the sect in the trial of the hunting demon.
墨师兄所使的毒功，甚是霸道，对阵之时只能以灵力强行压制。¤Senior Brother Mo's poisonous skill is very overbearing, and can only be suppressed forcibly with spiritual power during the match.
多谢，师尊。¤Thank you, Master.
倒是有点眼光，拿着吧。¤It's a little eye-sighted, take it.
师尊在上，请受徒儿一拜。¤Master above, please accept this disciple's bow.
弟子谨遵教诲。¤The disciple will follow the teachings.
至于为什么是小友，老夫也有一定猜想，小友若是感兴趣，不妨听老夫再啰嗦几句。¤As for why it is young friend, I also have certain guesses, if you are interested, you may listen to the Patriarch to ramble a few more words.
心儿此前刚出林府，天星城便已是启动大阵封锁，老夫料想心儿也未能出城。但若是停留城中，暴露行踪也不过是时间问题。¤Heart just before out of the Lin House, Star City has been the start of the Array blockade, the Patriarch expects heart also failed to leave the city. But if you stay in the city, it is only a matter of time before your whereabouts are exposed.
心儿的大哥也是与其交情不浅，还是孩童之时算得上是往来密切。连带之下，雪儿与心儿也是与他熟稔起来。心儿若要找人帮忙，找他自是上上之选。¤The heart's big brother is also its friendship is not shallow, or a child's time is counted as a close relationship. The first thing you need to do is to get to know the people you are talking to. If Xin'er needs help, he is the best choice.
小友不用惊慌，心儿给你的法宝是能一定程度上遮掩小友的气息，其他长老也确是未能发现小友潜入林府，否则这一路不会这么顺畅。¤The other elders were indeed unable to discover that you had infiltrated the Lin House, otherwise the journey would not have been so smooth.
再者以心儿的性子，若是被困住，自是不肯坐以待毙。如今能破此局的方法，除家主出关亲自主持大局外，便只有找个合适的理由，让老夫出手干涉了。¤Moreover, with the nature of the heart, if it is trapped, since it is not willing to sit and wait for death. The only way to break this game is to find a suitable reason for the Patriarch to intervene, in addition to the family head to personally preside over the situation.
这冲虚散人虽说是星宫大长老座下弟子，但已是停留在金丹后期数十年无半点进步，细细算来也当是寿元无多。心儿又是林家这一代中资质最好的一位，假以时日，有望同广微老祖一般化神飞升。¤Although this Chong Xu Sanren is said to be a disciple under the Star Palace Grand Elder, but is already stuck in the late Golden Core decades without half progress, a careful calculation is also when the life expectancy is not much. The heart is the best qualified one in this generation of the Lin family, and in time, it is expected to be the same as the Guangwei old ancestor general Deity Transformation ascension.
事到如今，老夫也不瞒着什么了。星宫素来以双修为重，而林家作为星宫的一支，素有与它系联姻的惯例，族中上下已是习以为常。虽说心儿对此一直有不满，甚至有些偏见，但对此次联姻的猜疑也不无道理。¤The matter has come to this point, the Patriarch is not hiding anything. The Star Palace has always been a dual-cultivation-oriented family, and the Lin family, as a member of the Star Palace, has a customary marriage with other families, and the whole family is already accustomed to it. Although Xin'er has been dissatisfied with this, and even a little prejudiced, but the suspicion of this marriage is not unreasonable.
{FirstName}小友，你来了。¤{FirstName}You're here, little friend.
前辈请说。¤Please speak, senior.
呵呵，本来老夫也不太肯定出现于此的会是谁，但片刻前老夫感知到小友出现在林府，便是有了些许结论。¤Oh, originally the Patriarch was not too sure who would appear here, but a few moments ago the Patriarch sensed that the young friend appeared in the Lin House, is to have some conclusions.
晚辈知晓。¤The junior knows.
前辈知道我要来？¤Seniors knew I was coming?
原本老夫还在猜想心儿是否知道，小友与倪家少爷此前乃是一同前来林府。即便心儿知晓此事且找上了小友，小友又是否愿意帮助心儿。这就不是老夫能妄加揣测的了。¤The original Patriarch was wondering if Xin'er knew that you and the young master of the Ni family had come to the Lin House together. Even if Xin'er knew about this and approached you, would you be willing to help Xin'er? This is not something that I can speculate on.
小友，你来了。¤Little friend, you are here.
但封城时，老夫已是见到倪家家主与其一同离去，心儿却滞留城中，定是寻而不得。在此种情况下，与倪家少爷一同前来林府的小友，也就顺理成章地成了心儿的选择了。¤But when the city is closed, I have seen the Ni family head with its departure, but the heart child is stranded in the city, must be looking for but can not. In this case, the young friend who came to the Lin House with the young master of the Ni family is also a logical choice for Xin'er.
而家主闭关多年，谁也不知道其中是什么情况，若不到最后关头，心儿自然不会选这条路。那老夫就只要于此静候心儿的消息便好。¤And the family head closed for many years, no one knows what the situation is, if not until the last moment, Xin'er naturally will not choose this path. Then I just have to wait here for Xin'er's news.
但我适时出现在了林府。¤But I appeared at the right time in the Lin House.
家主又是最为疼爱心儿，由此可想，这冲虚散人别说是星宫大长老弟子，即便是大长老本人，此次联姻也无半点可能。¤The family head is also the most loving heart child, so you can think, this Chongxu scattered not to mention the Star Palace Grand Elder disciple, even the Grand Elder himself, this union is not half possible.
呵呵，那就得先说说宁州几大家族年轻一辈的大少爷了。百里家那位性烈如火，但过于崇尚实力；而公孙家那位举止文雅，却是工于心计；最后倪家的大少爷，虽说贪玩且好管闲事，但因为性格直爽，也是人缘最好的一位。¤Oh, then we have to talk about the young masters of the young generation of several major families in Ning Province. The Baili family is fierce as fire, but too much reverence for strength; and the Gongsun family that is elegant in demeanor, but is calculating; and finally the Ni family's youngest, although playful and nosy, but because of the straightforward character, is also one of the best people.
若无其他要事，小友还是快些回去找心儿吧，料想那丫头正担心着呢。¤If there is no other important business, you should go back to Xin'er quickly, I think that girl is worried about it.
听老夫啰嗦了这么久，现在该小友说说你们的计划了。¤Listen to the Patriarch nagging for so long, now it's time for little friend to talk about your plans.
呵呵，不错，小友的出现让答案昭然若揭。¤Oh, not bad, the answer to the question of your appearance is clearly revealed.
你将此前与林沐心的交流一一道来，通羽上人只是静静聆听，直到你说完还保持着一副若有所思的样子。¤The first thing you can do is to tell us about your previous exchange with Lin MuXin, and the top of the Tong Yu just listened quietly until you finished and kept a thoughtful look.
嗯...请小友转告心儿，若是你们有了计划，老夫会伺机配合。如有找到其他长老收贿受赂的证据，老夫更是可以强行终止这次联姻，等家主出关再做处理。¤The firstName}{Daoyou} is {Daoyou}. Please little friend to tell Xin'er, if you have a plan, the Patriarch will wait for the opportunity to cooperate. If there is evidence found that the other elders have accepted bribes and bribes, the Patriarch can even forcibly terminate this union and wait for the family head to come out of customs.
我想，此人既然敢在方壶山作恶，我宗定不会坐视不管的。¤I think, since this person dared to do evil in Square Cauldron Mountain, my clan would not sit idly by and do nothing.
大哥应该是在方壶山附近采摘炼丹所需的药材吧...但那附近可是竹山宗的地界，能出什么意外呢？¤Brother should be picking the medicinal materials needed for alchemy near Square Cauldron Mountain... But what can happen to the Bamboo Mountain sect's boundary nearby?
我这就去往竹山宗，请竹山宗的长老们帮忙调查此事！¤I'm going to Bamboo Mountain Sect, please help the elders of Bamboo Mountain Sect to investigate this matter!
真的非常感谢你能告诉我这些，我也没有什么能够报答你的，这几颗是大哥生前炼制的丹药，还请你能够收下...¤Thank you very much for telling me this. I have nothing to repay you. These are the pills that my elder brother refined during his lifetime. Please accept it...
你找到我大哥了？¤Have you found my big brother?
别难过了，人死不能复生。¤Don't be sad, you can't come back from death.
道友，看你一个人在这里发愁，可是遇到了什么难处？¤Friends, see you worrying here alone, but what difficulties have you encountered?
{vpunch=10,0.5}这...这是我大哥的储物袋！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}This...this is my big brother's storage bag!
你...你有我大哥的消息了？¤You... have you heard from my eldest brother?
你可知道你大哥与你分别前是去了什么地方？¤Do you know where your eldest brother went before he parted with you?
你说的对，我这就去往竹山宗，请竹山宗的长老为我大哥报仇！¤You are right, I will go to Bamboo Mountain Sect and ask the elders of Bamboo Mountain Sect to avenge my elder brother!
(我还是不要多管闲事了吧。)¤(I'd better not meddle.)
哎...可别出了什么事才好...¤Hey... don't do anything wrong...
你将自己在方壶山的所见所闻一一说来。¤You will talk about what you have seen and heard in Square Cauldron Mountain.
我想，此人既然敢在方壶山作恶，竹山宗定然不会坐视不管的。¤I think, since this person dares to do evil in Square Cauldron Mountain, Bamboo Mountain Sect will definitely not sit back and watch.
哎...大哥怎么还没有回来，这都已经过去那么久了...¤Hey...Big Brother hasn't come back yet, it's been so long...
呜呜呜...都怪我，大哥若不是为了帮我采药炼丹，也不会遇到这种事...¤Uuuuu... blame me, if eldest brother didn't help me gather medicine and make alchemy, he wouldn't have encountered such a thing...
谢谢你告诉我这些！既然这个人敢在方壶山作恶，竹山宗肯定不会坐视不管的。¤Thank you for telling me this! Since this person dares to do evil in Square Cauldron Mountain, Bamboo Mountain Sect will definitely not sit back and watch.
哎...这可如何是好...¤Hey...how can this be good...
我这就去往竹山宗！¤I will go to Bamboo Mountain Sect!
这么说，我大哥很有可能也是被此人抓去了...¤That said, my eldest brother was probably also arrested by this person...
阁下有所不知。我与大哥约定要在这广陵城的客栈碰面，眼下这约定的时间已经过去大半个月了，大哥却还不见踪影。¤Your Excellency doesn't know. My eldest brother and I agreed to meet at the inn in Guangling City. It has been more than half a month since the agreed time, but the eldest brother is still missing.
道友莫急，这头怪物就交给我吧。¤Daoist friends do not hurry, this monster will be left to me.
你我联...噗~~¤You and I joined... Pfft~~
不远处阵阵咆哮伴随着剧烈的能量波动传来，乃是一只造型丑陋的怪龙正在围攻一个屏障，屏障之中端坐着一个剑眉星目的俊朗男子。¤Not far away bursts of roar accompanied by violent energy fluctuations came, is an ugly shape of the monster dragon is besieging a barrier, the barrier is sitting in a sword eyebrows starry-eyed handsome man.
在下就是龙族族长敖玄，来你我联手除去这尸蛟。¤I am Ao Xuan, the dragon clan chief, come you and I will join forces to remove this corpse jiao.
见你靠近怪龙停手目露凶光的看着你，又时不时贪婪的望向屏障中的男子，而屏障中的男子疑惑的看了看你与悬在身边的龙鳞印。¤Seeing that you approached the strange dragon, stopped and looked at you with fierce eyes, and from time to time greedily looked at the man in the barrier, and the man in the barrier looked at you and the dragon scale print hanging beside you suspiciously.
这男子捏起法诀，你感受到身边的龙鳞印似有感应，开始颤动。¤The man squeezed up the magic trick, you feel the dragon scale seal around you seems to have sensed, began to tremble.
话音未落，敖玄就喷出一口鲜血，虚弱的跪倒在了地上。¤Before the words left his mouth, Ao Xuan spurted out a mouthful of blood and weakly fell to his knees.
这陨龙之地乃是上古龙宫的碎片，我受困此地传音符发不出去，也是难怪。¤This land of the meteoric dragon is a fragment of the Ancient Dragon Palace, I am trapped here sound transmission talisman can not send out, it is no wonder.
你不是来救我的？¤You didn't come to save me?
敖灵？这傻丫头哦。¤Ao Ling? This silly girl oh.
还好道友来得早，要不然死在这两只畜生手中怕是要连皮带骨都被吞个干净喽。¤Fortunately, you came early, or die in the hands of these two beasts are afraid to be swallowed clean with the belt and bones.
（你还挺会讲话....）¤（You're a good talker ....）
真是龙鳞印？阁下面生，看来是我龙族的新客卿？¤Really dragon scale seal? Your face is new, you seem to be a new guest of my dragon clan?
这陨龙之地乃是上古龙宫的碎片，我受困此地传音符发不出去，也就是她还会如此费心找人前来救我。¤This place of meteoric dragon is the fragment of the Ancient Dragon Palace, I am trapped here to send out the voice talisman, that is, she will still be so bothered to find someone to come to my rescue.
咳咳咳....¤Cough cough ....
我有要事回报，我宁州城内有魔门余孽。¤I have something important to report. Currently, there're Evil Cultivators in our Ning Province City.
你就将此物带到离火门沃焦山执事堂，再将交换的物品带回来。¤Bring this item to the Deacon Hall of Heavenly Fire Gate on Inferno Mountain, and then bring back the exchanged items.
我直接出手了结这个魔教妖人。¤I just shot this demonic person.
我了解了，剩下的具体事宜，就由我们审问这两个家伙得知吧。¤I understand, the rest of the specific matters, let us interrogate these two guys.
宁王府确实暗通魔教，那宁王为了续命，搭上了天魔道换取活人入药秘术用以续命。¤Prince Ning's Mansion did secretly communicate with Demon Cult. In order to continue his life, Ning King used the Heavenly Demon Dao in exchange for the secret technique of living beings to be used to continue his life.
血剑宫，血剑宫是雍州第一大派，和我白帝楼颇有宿怨，你以后遇到要谨慎应对。¤Blood Sword Palace. The Blood Sword Palace is the largest school in Yongzhou. It has a grudge against my Baidi Tower. You should be cautious when you encounter it in the future.
我们与离火门合作，一直在寻找，离火门内部的真正的内鬼。¤We are cooperating with Heavenly Fire Gate and are always looking for the real ghost inside Heavenly Fire Gate.
唉，宁王府我自然不放在眼里，但是...这宁王府背后可是玄道宗。¤Oh, I naturally don't care about Prince Ning's Mansion, but... Behind this Prince Ning's Mansion is Mystic Dao Sect.
不得不说，自从那墨居仁暴露之后，虽然积极配合调查但是隐藏下来的魔门妖人，却也没有什么进展。¤It has to be said that since Mo Juren was exposed, although he actively cooperated with the investigation, the hidden demons have not made any progress.
快讲！¤Speak up!
道友，我白帝楼绝学仅对持有白帝令的青年才俊开放。¤Friends of Taoism, my White Emperor Manor's unique learning is only open to young talents who hold the White Emperor Order.
空间裂缝？！¤Space crack?!
此次不同的怀疑对象，会接到不一样的情报，就看那个鱼儿上钩了。所以你也不要太过忧心，也许此行并不会出事。¤Different suspects will receive different information this time, depending on that fish got the bait. So don't worry too much, maybe this trip will not happen.
你那位好友，也是这样加入宁王府的？¤That's how your good friend joined Prince Ning's Mansion?
所伤，目前下落他二人也不知。¤Injured, the whereabouts of both of them are unknown.
离火门绝焰堂执事墨居仁，因修炼¤Mo Juren, a deacon of Absolute Flame Hall from the Heavenly Fire Gate, due to practicing
...嗯，我知道了。\r此事事关重大，还望你保密。¤... Well, I know. \r This is a matter of great importance, and I hope you will keep it a secret.
这一次在巫山活动的人确实是在追击叛徒黑心老人，据二人所说黑心老人被¤This time the people who were active in Wushan were indeed chasing the traitor Grandfather Blackheart. According to the two, the Grandfather Blackheart was caught
快讲。¤Speak quickly.
所以这一次我们决定引蛇出洞！¤So this time we decided to lead the snake out of the cave!
墨居仁啊...没想到啊。¤Mo Juren... I didn't expect it.
寿元亏空，伤了根本，再难突破，所以受到古神教的诱惑。¤Shouyuan was short-lived, hurting the roots, and it is difficult to break through, so I was tempted by the ancient gods.
对，没有确凿证据，这宁州谁都动不了他。¤Yes, without conclusive evidence, no one in Ning Province can touch him.
我？这些东西应该很是贵重的吧？¤Me? These things should be very valuable, right?
那如今除了这些，可有其他线索？¤So besides these, are there other clues now?
道友，既然有此心意，那我白帝楼欢迎你的加入，从今以后你就是白帝楼内阁弟子，可以兑换我白帝楼核心功法和高阶仙剑。¤Daoist, since I have this intention, I welcome you to join the Baidilou. From now on, you will be a disciple of the Baidilou cabinet, and you can exchange my Baidilou core exercises and high-level fairy swords.
又一个？天魔道究竟有多少据点？¤Another one? Just how many strongholds does the Heavenly Demon Path have?
天魔眼？此事事关重大，速速道来¤The Eye of the Demon? This matter is of great importance, come quickly.
我在九嶷山，遇到被蛊真人所伤的黑心老人。¤I was in Jiuyi Mountain and met Grandfather Blackheart who was hurt by Lord Gu.
所以，我想拜托你帮我，查查这宁王府。¤So, I want to ask you to help me check this Ning Palace.
近年来，化尘教自封山门，已有数年未招收弟子，不知是出现了什么变故。¤In the past few years, the Dust Transformation Sect has closed it's doors and not recruited any disciples. Investigate the reasons.
我有情报需要汇报，此事关乎天魔眼。¤I have information to report, this matter is related to the eyes of the demon.
不论如何，你帮了我也算是为我挚友报仇，而且此番能够查清天魔道于宁王府勾结之事，也是大功一件，理应获得奖赏。¤In any case, you have helped me to avenge the death of my friend, and you should be rewarded for your efforts to uncover the collusion between the Heavenly Demon Path and the Ning Dynasty.
还是多谢你帮我了却一桩心事。¤Thank you for helping me, but it's a worry.
没，其实这算是我私人的一个请求吧。¤No, this is actually a personal request of mine.
嗯，你所说的我已记录，之后的事件我会处理的。¤Well, I have recorded what you said, and I will handle the subsequent events.
嗯...我知道了。¤Um...I got it.
起初她所使用的不过是普通的剑术，见不能将我拿下后，对方御使一柄血气缭绕的仙剑，攻势极其凌厉。¤In the beginning, she only used ordinary swordsmanship. Seeing that she couldn't take me down, the enemy's imperial envoy had a bloody fairy sword, and the offensive was extremely fierce.
玄道宗？¤Mystic Daozong?
嗯，我这就前往。¤Well, I will go now.
他们有什么问题吗？他们也勾结魔修了？¤Do they have any problems? They are also colluding with evil cultivator?
血剑宫极为残忍，每个寿元将尽突破无望的金丹修士都要强制加入祭血使。¤The Blood Sword Palace is extremely cruel, and every golden core cultivator who have no hope of making a breakthrough will be forced to join the blood envoy.
更蹊跷的是，我亲自打探，得到的情报是他已经抵达中州，而宁王府近日也无异常。¤What's more strange is that I personally inquired, and the information I got was that he had arrived in Zhongzhou, and Prince Ning's Mansion has not been abnormal recently.
你是指？古神教的叛徒？¤You mean? A traitor to the ancient religion?
应该又是魔教妖人作祟。¤It should be the demon cult monster who is at the trouble again.
对方深深的看着你，似乎在辨别所说的真伪。¤The other party looks at you deeply, seeming to discern the authenticity of what is said.
而且，还有人假冒各个门派的修士，袭杀各个宗门参加试炼的人。¤Furthermore, there are people who pretend to be cultivators of various sects and attack and kill those who participate in the trials of various sects.
天邪子来势汹汹，覆巢之下无完卵，我不得不和他联手自保。¤Tian Xiezi is coming fiercely, and there are no eggs under the covering nest. I have to join him to protect myself.
天魔眼中有人从¤There is someone in the eyes of the devil
墨师兄...最后被大师兄带走，也不知道如何了¤Brother Mo... was finally taken away by Senior Brother, and I don’t know what to do.
墨居仁...我还有印象，此人最后被炎萧所带走。¤Mo Juren...I still have the impression that this person was finally taken away by Yan Xiao.
我们收到情报最近{color=#d0380a}巫山{/color}似有古神教中人出现，需要你前往调查一番。¤We have received information that recently {color=#d0380a}Wushan{/color} seems to have people from the ancient gods, and we need you to investigate.
中出来。¤Come out.
所以，你是要我以此加入宁王府？¤So, you want me to join Prince Ning's Mansion with this?
对方是？¤The other party?
晚辈依照所示，前往正阳山调查化尘教封山一事。就目前已知的线索来看，化尘教应该是被魔门渗透了，而幕后黑手正是...¤I went to Mt. Rising Sun to investigate the closure of the Dust Cultivation Sect as shown. From the known clues, it seems that the Cult of Dust has been infiltrated by the Demon Sect, and the mastermind behind it is...
这是我承诺的酬劳，我不会食言的。你可以三选一。¤This is the reward I promised. I won't break my promise. You can choose one of three.
正是¤Exactly
你若有机会经过正阳山一带，可以代为打听一番，看能否得到一些有用的情报。¤If you have the opportunity to pass through the Mt. Rising Sun area, you can ask around on your behalf and see if you can get some useful information.
我们白帝楼剿灭过的大小据点，就已经有数近十处了。¤The number of strongholds, large and small, that our White Emperor's House has destroyed is already close to ten.
这一次在巫山活动的人确实是在追击叛徒黑心老人，但他们还不知道天邪子被我诛杀。¤The people who were active in Wushan this time are indeed chasing the traitor Blackhearted Old Man, but they still don't know that Tian Xiezi was killed by me.
古神教的，被我放倒了，剩下的就交给阁下了。¤of the Ancient Gods, which I have put down, and leave the rest to your Excellency.
我们与离火门合作，一直在寻找离火门内部的真正的内鬼。¤We are cooperating with Heavenly Fire Gate and are always looking for the real ghost inside Heavenly Fire Gate.
小友此番倒是很快嘛，这两个人是？¤You are very quick this time, are these two people?
这不就是金丹巅峰的死士？¤Isn't this the dead man of Peak Golden Core?
对方是金丹修士，此番凶险辛苦你了。¤The other party is the Golden Core cultivator, you have worked hard for this treacherousness.
但是，不久之后他存在我这里的命符碎裂。¤But, shortly afterwards, his life talisman in my place shattered.
此次事件，始作俑者是倪振南，意在打探戮仙剑的下落。¤The instigator of this incident is Ni Zhennan, who intends to probe the whereabouts of the Immortal Executing Sword.
这人剑，乃是我白帝楼剑术入门典籍，你好好参悟一番。¤This human sword is an introductory classic of my Baidilou swordsmanship. Please take a good look.
这是此番任务的奖励，这次多谢小友你了。¤This is the reward for this mission, this time thank you very much, little friend.
通常我白帝楼信物白帝令是发放给能在英杰会取得魁首的青年才俊的，毕竟魔修凶狠诡诈，庸人入我白帝楼也是白白送命。¤Usually, the Baidi Order of my Baidilou keepsake is issued to young talents who can get the leader in Yingjie's meeting. After all, evil cultivator is fierce and deceitful, and the mediocre person who enters my Baidilou will also die in vain.
（看来此事还是有人察觉了。）¤(It seems that someone is aware of this.)
道友，宗门弟子不能成为我白帝楼的核心弟子。¤Friends of Taoism, sect disciples cannot be the core disciples of my Baidilou.
好了，此事我已知晓。后续楼内会处理的。¤Okay, I know about this. It will be dealt with in the follow-up building.
我有情报需要汇报，此事关乎黑心老人。¤I have information to report. This is about the Grandfather Blackheart.
此番道友功不可没，这些灵核便赠与道友了。¤These spiritual cores will be given to you for your merits.
晚辈，已经获得些许线索，回来复命。¤Junior, I have obtained some clues, come back and return to life.
化尘教自封山门数年，近日才开始重新招收弟子，也不知是出现了什么变故。¤The Dust Transformation Sect has only recently started to re-admit disciples after several years of closure, and it is not known what changes have occurred.
他所使用的是何法门？¤What method did he use?
宁王，在逸风城摆下斗法台招收优胜的筑基修士作为供奉。¤Ning King, set up a fighting platform in Yifeng City to recruit the winning foundation-building cultivators as guest elders.
道友，你还未通过我白帝楼的考验。（当前声望不足）¤Friends, you have not passed the test of my Baidilou. (Currently insufficient reputation)
黑心老人？那个古神教的叛徒？¤Blackhearted old man? That traitor to the ancient religion?
什么？竟有魔修如此猖狂。¤What? There is such a rampant evil cultivator.
逸风城？¤Yafeng City?
我已查清。¤I have found out.
你听说过，宁王府吗？¤Have you heard of Prince Ning's Mansion?
天魔眼已被封禁，有玄道宗看守，不会有问题吧~¤The Eye of the Demon has been banned, and it is guarded by the Mystic Dao Sect, there will be no problem~
道友，我白帝楼的核心弟子需要剑道初窥门径。¤Friends of Taoism, my core disciple of Baidilou needs a first glimpse of kendo.
是这样吗？剩下的具体事宜，就由我们审问这两个家伙得知吧。¤Is that so? The rest of the specific matters, let us interrogate these two guys.
离火门也被古神教侵扰？¤Heavenly Fire Gate is also infested by ancient gods?
我有一位好友曾加入宁王府成为供奉，前段时间他传信于我，说他受宁王之托要动身去往中州办事。¤I have a good friend who once joined the Ning King's household as a guest elder. Some time ago, he sent me a letter saying that he had been asked by the Ning King to leave for Central China on an errand.
嗜血珠？我并未见到。¤Bloodthirsty Bead? I didn't see it.
离火门之中还有魔门内鬼？嗯，我了解了。此事我会处理的。¤There are ghosts in the demon sect in the Heavenly Fire Gate? Well, I understand. I will take care of this matter.
血剑宫会以秘法将他们提升至金丹巅峰，同时迫使他们参加各个危险的任务，以求于绝境中窥得突破的契机。¤The Blood Sword Palace will use secret methods to elevate them to the peak of the golden core, and at the same time force them to participate in various dangerous missions, in order to see the opportunity of breakthrough in the desperate situation.
对，此事凶险，你若是为难就当我没说过吧，但只要能查清真相，不论是结丹秘术，还是内阁功法，亦或是法宝级的仙剑，我都可以作为报答。¤Yes, this matter is dangerous. If you are embarrassed, take it as I have not said it, but as long as you can find out the truth, whether it is the secret pill formation, the cabinet technique, or the magic weapon level fairy sword, I can repay it. .
要不然怎么是引蛇出洞？表面上是以暗度陈仓的方式交易，这种交易我们已经维系了很久了，对方必不会起疑。安心此次有高手暗中保护你的。¤Otherwise, how can it lead the snake out of the hole? On the surface, it is a secret transaction. We have maintained this kind of transaction for a long time, and the other party will not be suspicious. An Xin has a master secretly protecting you this time.
不知道，我现在能否成为白帝楼内阁弟子。¤I don't know, whether I can become a disciple of the Baidilou cabinet now.
你就将此物带到你离火门沃焦山执事堂，再将交换的物品带回来。¤Bring this item to your Deacon Hall of Heavenly Fire Gate on Inferno Mountain, and then bring back the exchanged items.
不过毕竟此行很是危险，此番我白帝楼愿意提供{color=#d0380a}结丹秘术《大周天吐纳》{/color}供你一阅。¤But after all, this trip is very dangerous. This time, my Baidilou is willing to provide {color=#d0380a} the secret technique of forming alchemy Big Zhoutian Tuna{/color} for you to read.
是有关宁王府的。¤It is about the House of Ning.
嗯.....不过，你可知嗜血珠的下落？¤Um... But, do you know where the Bloodthirsty Bead is?
据离火门求助，离火门绝焰堂执事墨居仁受古神教诱惑，但内鬼不只他一人。¤According to Heavenly Fire Gate, Mo Juren, the deacon of Absolute Flame Hall, was tempted by the ancient gods, but he was not the alone traitor.
以白帝楼的势力，你何必如此大费周折。¤With the power of Baidilou, why do you bother so much.
是这样吗？¤Is that right?
最近{color=#d0380a}巫山{/color}有可疑之人出现，所以需要你前往调查一番。¤Recently {color=#d0380a}Wu Mountain {/color} there are suspicious people appear, so you need to go to investigate some.
我有情报需要汇报，此事关乎倪家。¤I have information to report, and this is related to the Ni family.
不过你并非化尘教弟子，出入正阳山，还需小心行事。¤However, you are not a disciple of the Dust Transformation Cult, and you need to be careful when entering and leaving Mt. Rising Sun.
但之后得知，似乎还有内鬼。¤But then I learned that there seems to be an inner ghost.
此番又有何发现？¤What have we found this time?
这是此番任务的酬劳，小友收好。¤This is a reward for this task, and the little friend will collect it.
道友想要成为内阁弟子，还需先持有我白帝楼信物。¤If you want to become a cabinet disciple, you need to hold my Baidilou token first.
我与那邪修交过手，虽不能确定他是否是魔门，但其手段也绝非正道。¤I have fought with that evil cultivator, and although I cannot be sure whether he is a demon, his methods are by no means righteous.
我最后帮助他击杀天邪子。¤I finally helped him kill the evil cultivator.
据你回报，离火门绝焰堂执事墨居仁之事。¤According to your report, it is about Mo Juren, the deacon of Absolute Flame Hall from Heavenly Fire Gate.
目前没有什么需要交给道友的的任务。¤There are currently no tasks that need to be handed over to the Taoist.
我在九嶷山，遇到被蛊真人所伤的黑心老人。他已经被天邪子所发现。¤I was in Jiuyi Mountain and met Grandfather Blackheart who was wounded by True Man Gu. He has been discovered by Tian Xiezi.
我离火门，居然还有此叛徒？¤My Heavenly Fire Gate, but there is still this traitor?
但是，自那以后我便再也没有收到过他的传音符。现在想来，恐怕已经...¤But since then I have not received any more voice messengers from him. Now that I think about it, I'm afraid it has...
...嗯，我知道了。\r\n此事事关重大，还望你保密。¤...Well, I see. \r\nThis matter is very important, I hope you keep it secret.
祭血使？¤Sacrifice to the blood envoy?
我通过他们往来的传音玉简，还了解到古神教叛徒...¤I also learnt about the Ancient Gods traitors through the sound transmission jade slips they exchanged...
祭血令？能击杀祭血使，此番凶险真的辛苦你了。¤Blood sacrifice order? It is really hard for you to be able to kill the blood sacrifice.
我有一位好友，加入宁王府成为供奉，前段时间他传信跟我说他受宁王之托，动身中州办事。¤I have a good friend who joined Prince Ning's Mansion as a guest elder. Some time ago, he sent a letter to me that he was entrusted by Ning King to leave for Zhongzhou.
我这里有结丹秘术《小周天吐纳》，地阶剑道功法《砺剑诀》，以及一柄上品法宝仙剑。你可以从中任选其一。¤I have here the secret art of dan formation, Small Circumference Exhalation, the earth-rank sword technique, 《Sharpening Sword Technique》, and a top-grade magic treasure, the Immortal Sword. You can choose any one of them.
倪家？可是与倪家家主的中毒有关。¤The Ni family? But it is related to the poisoning of the head of the Ni family.
怎么，你与他熟识？¤Why, are you acquainted with him?
我手头的任务，需持有白帝令的青年才俊方可执行，道友不太合适。¤The task I have at hand needs to be carried out by young talents with Baidi Orders. Daoists are not suitable.
所以，我要如何行事？¤So, how do I act?
我在武陵城内，遇到一散修声称对我白帝楼很是仰慕，希望得人道剑典一观，之后将我诱骗至她的住处袭击我。¤In Wuling City, I met a independent Cultivator who claimed that he admired my White Emperor Tower very much, and hoped to get a view of the Human Dao Sword Canon, and then lured me to her residence to attack me.
又一个天魔道据点…只是没想到，竟在竹山宗…¤Another Heavenly Demon stronghold...only I didn't expect it to be in the Bamboo Mountain Sect...
盗取了至宝嗜血珠，逃来了宁州，而古神教也已派遣护法前来追击。¤Having stolen the supreme treasure, the Bloodthirsty Pearl, he has fled to Ning Province, and the Ancient God Sect has dispatched its Guardians to pursue him.
道友，我白帝楼除魔卫道，你好自为之。¤Friends of Taoism, I'm Baidilou to eliminate demons and defend Taoism, so you can do it for yourself.
节哀...¤My condolences...
离火门？此事事关重大，速速道来。¤Heavenly Fire Gate? This matter is very important, come quickly.
近日屡屡有散修在方壶山一带失踪，原来是被一邪修抓了去。¤Recently there have been repeated disappearances of independent cultivators around the Fang Hu Mountain area, which turned out to be captured by an evil cultivator.
此番凶险，这是我白帝楼的奖励，还望不要嫌弃。¤This time is dangerous, this is my reward from Baidilou, and I don't want to dislike it.
这倒不是，墨居仁当年也算是一奇人，资质平平，但悟性极高。更是修炼威名赫赫的魔焰决，算是与炎萧同一批进入筑基期的“天才”呢。这是没想到啊....¤This is not the case, Mo Juren was also considered a strange person back then, with mediocre aptitudes, but extremely high understanding. Even more so, he cultivated the prestigious Demon Flame Jue, and he was regarded as the same group of geniuses who entered the Foundation Establishment stage as Yan Xiao. This is unexpected....
天魔道极会利用心魔与执念，往往许下点蝇头小利，便能蛊惑人心。¤The Heavenly Demon Path is extremely good at exploiting the demons and obsessions of the heart, often compelling the mind with the promise of a small profit.
我有情报需要汇报，此事关乎离火门。¤I have information to report. This is about Heavenly Fire Gate.
离火门作为仙宗大派，日常物资往来也是极多的，这一次他们向我白帝楼提出以火麟玉交换仙剑和各种灵材，就由你来送去。¤Heavenly Fire Gate is a major faction of the immortal sect, and there are a lot of daily material exchanges. This time they proposed to my White Emperor Pavilion to exchange the fire lin jade for immortal swords and various spiritual materials, and you will send them.
不错，魔教妖人人人得而诛之。不过，你可知嗜血珠的下落？¤Yes, everyone is punishable by the demons. But, do you know the whereabouts of the bloodthirsty bead?
道友，我白帝楼的核心弟子需有筑基修为。¤Fellow Daoist, the core disciples of my White Emperor's House are required to have Foundation Establishment cultivation.
原来如此，辛苦小友了，我白帝楼对这些事绝不会坐视不理。¤That's it, hard work, my Baidilou will never sit idly by and ignore these things.
嗯..我明白了。¤oh, I understand now.
还记得上次你带回来的情报吗？¤Remember the information you brought back last time?
嗜血珠？似乎还在黑心老人身上。¤Bloodthirsty Bead? It seems that it is still on the Grandfather Blackheart.
原来如此，怪不得炎萧似是与此人有旧。¤It turns out that it is no wonder that Yan Xiao seems to have an old relationship with this person.
原来如此，唉....¤So that's it, alas ....
这一次在巫山活动的人确实是追击叛徒黑心老人，据二人所说黑心老人被¤The people who were active in Wushan this time were indeed chasing the traitor Grandfather Blackheart. According to the two, the Grandfather Blackheart was caught
活捉古神教妖人，这可是大功一件啊。这一次魔门妖人，又有何图谋？¤Catch the ancient gods and teach the demon alive, this is a great achievement. This time the demon demon, what plot?
你将枯木老祖私通天魔道之事如实相告。¤You will tell the truth about Elder Deadwood's illicit access to the Heavenly Demon Dao.
趁着这一年一次的秘市，只要我凑够灵石，未尝不可以行为精进一层。¤Taking advantage of this once-a-year secret market, as long as I gather enough spirit stones, it might be possible to improve my behavior.
嗯？消息走漏了？¤Hmm? Did the news get out?
那{shidi}小心。¤Then {shidi} beware.
不可能，此行就你我二人轻装而来。不行，迟则生变{shidi}你留在此地接引后续弟子，我先行潜入。¤It's not possible. You and I are the only ones who came here lightly. No, it's too late. {shidi} You stay here and guide the followers, I'll sneak in first.
钟师兄，还是我来吧，这玄古门精于对付妖族还是我更保险一点。¤Brother Zhong, it's better for me to do it. This Profound Ancient Sect is skilled in dealing with the demon race or I am a little safer.
{shidi}，前面的古月寨现在就是玄古门总部。¤{shidi}, the ancient moon cottage in front is now the Profound Ancient Sect headquarters.
不知为何，此时古月寨的守山大阵全力运转。¤For some reason, the Gu Yue Cottage's Mountain Guarding Formation was in full operation at this time.
好，我去云汐城跑一趟便是，你们便在此等我吧。¤Alright, I'll go to Yunxi City for a run, you can wait for me here.
被星宫宫主持续压迫的冲虚散人像是抓到了救命稻草，状若疯狂地向你嘶吼。¤Chongxu San, who was continuously oppressed by the Star Palace Palace Master, seemed to have caught a life-saving straw and screamed at you like crazy.
又是你！一次又一次的，像只烦人的森蛛一般，来坏我好事！¤you again! Time and time again, like an annoying forest spider, it's bad for me!
你推门而入后，林沐心迅速结束修炼，走向门口，眼中满溢着希望地看向你。而星铃儿只是慵懒的转过身，靠着窗栏将目光投过来。¤After you pushed the door and entered, Lin Muxin quickly ended her practice and walked to the door, looking at you with hope in her eyes. And Xing Linger just turned around lazily, leaning against the window rail to cast her eyes.
老朽此后定将严加看管，他若敢再犯，必将立时清理门户。¤The old man will be strictly guarded from now on, and if he dares to do it again, he will immediately clear the door.
而且还被你们弄出个棘手的谣言。¤And you made a tricky rumor.
{FirstName}道友，宫主虽是给你一本秘籍作为回报，但我们若不感谢你一番，实是过意不去。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, although the Palace Master gave you a secret book in return, it would be really unfortunate if we didn't thank you.
林沐心正盘腿坐在地上修炼。星铃儿则凭栏而立，不知是在思考着什么，还是在欣赏那漫天交相辉映却又清冷的漫天星月。¤Lin Muxin was sitting cross-legged on the ground practicing. Xing Ling'er was leaning against the railing, wondering if she was thinking about something, or just admiring the starry moon that complemented each other in the sky.
哼，你叫林沐心就是{$lin}，到我这却换成了星道友？¤Hmph, your name is Lin Muxin, that's {$lin}, but when I came to my place, it was replaced by a fellow star daoist?
此术名唤《神交法》，乃星宫高阶双修秘术，现以此法赠与小友，还请勿外传。¤The name of this technique is Divine Crossing Law. It is a high-level double-cultivation secret technique of the Xinggong Palace. It is now a gift to my little friends. Please do not spread it.
之后便是林沐心向两位长老讲述整件事的经过，以及三人不断的对你夸赞，许久才各自离去。¤After that, Lin Muxin told the two elders about the whole thing, and the three of them kept praising you, and they left after a long time.
冲虚散人适才的气势早已消弭无踪，其内心怕是也像现下的长老堂一般，满地狼藉，混乱不堪，一时是不敢再开口言语。¤The momentum of Chongxu Sanren Shicai has long since disappeared, and his heart is afraid that it is like the current presbytery.
但你们也是实力不俗，再者冲虚散人境界未稳，竟是矗立在这风暴中一步未退。而室内的桌椅屏风等，虽尽皆不是凡物，却在此时遭了殃。¤But you are also of good strength, and the realm of rushing into the void is not stable, and you are standing in this storm without retreating. The indoor tables, chairs, screens, etc., although all are not ordinary things, but suffered disaster at this time.
也罢，你纵是不说，本宫也能猜到几分。¤Anyway, even if you don't say it, Ben Gong can guess a few points.
本姑娘也不为难你们，只是奔波数天有些馋了，先给我准备一坛好酒吧。¤This girl doesn't make it difficult for you, but I'm a little greedy after running around for a few days. First, prepare a good bar for me.
你这不识好歹的黄毛丫头，待我解决了外人，再来教训你！¤You ignorant yellow-haired girl, I will teach you a lesson when I solve the outsider!
哦？本宫的弟子可是提到冲虚长老为了突破，用了不少手段啊。¤Oh? The disciples of this palace mentioned that Elder Chongxu used a lot of methods in order to break through.
好啦好啦，小友可是为星宫出力不少，铃儿不要在计较这些了。¤Alright, alright, little friend has contributed a lot to Xinggong, so don't worry about it.
你跟着苗矮上人优哉游哉地来到长老堂。通羽上人和林家姐妹毅然在座，看到你进来，他们也是向你点头示意。¤You followed Master Miao Diao to the Elder Hall leisurely and leisurely. Master Tong Yu and the Lin family sisters were present resolutely, and when they saw you coming in, they also nodded to you.
{FirstName}小友实力真是惊人，冲虚散人在你手下竟无反抗之力。¤The strength of little friend {FirstName} is really amazing, the Chongxu Sanren has no resistance under your hands.
嗯，{$lin}的父亲不知去了何处闭关，无法为林府主持公道。我们又听闻星宫宫主近年来也一直在宫内闭关，只得请她老人家出来主事。但冲虚散人作为星宫长老，又盘踞其中，怕是不会给我们机会。所以...¤Well, {$lin}'s father did not know where he went to retreat, so he couldn't do justice for the Lin Mansion. We also heard that the Palace Master of the Star Palace has been retreating in the palace in recent years, so we had to invite her old man to come out as the master. But Chongxu Sanren, as the elders of the Star Palace, is entrenched in it, and I am afraid that it will not give us a chance. so...
（但他怎么能想到...）¤(But how could he have thought...)
我...我，我知错了！我不该贪图权势，我不该为难林家，我...我还不该...¤I...I, I knew I was wrong! I shouldn't covet power, I shouldn't embarrass the Lin family, I...I shouldn't...
老朽定会好好教训这孽徒，还请宫主放心。¤The old man will definitely teach this scoundrel well, and please rest assured the Palace Master.
看星宫宫主没有松口的意思，冲虚散人又是连忙跪下，一副诚恳认错的样子，前后的反差让星宫宫主直皱眉头。¤Seeing that the Palace Master of Star Palace did not want to let go, the Chongxu Sanren hurriedly knelt down again, with a sincere look of admitting his mistake. The contrast between the front and the back made the Palace Master of Star Palace frown.
正当你以为出了岔子时，却看见星玲儿向你眨眨眼睛示意不用担心。¤Just when you thought something was wrong, you saw Xing Linger wink at you to signal that you don't have to worry.
闻言，其他人都是看向星玲儿，却发现她不知何时已是离开冲虚散人身旁，躲到了你的身后，一时间让你成了众人的焦点。¤Hearing that, everyone else looked at Xing Linger, but found that she had left Chongxu Sanren at some point and hid behind you, making you the focus of everyone for a while.
前辈谬赞了，晚辈不过是...¤The seniors are rude, the juniors are just...
仔细想来，天星城也有与盈手露齐名的醉仙酿，但料想是与前者走的不同路子。不然林沐心贵为林府二小姐，也不至于为这极品盈手露着迷。¤Thinking about it carefully, Tianxing City also has Zuixian Brewing, which is as famous as Yingshoulu, but it is expected to take a different path from the former. Otherwise, Lin Muxin wouldn't be fascinated by this superb hand show because she was the second young lady of the Lin Mansion.
大胆！当着本宫的面还敢出手伤人！¤Be bold! Dare to hurt people in front of Ben Gong!
哼，若不是{FirstName}小友找到本宫的弟子，只怕不出几日冲虚长老就要执掌星宫了罢？¤Hmph, if it wasn't for the little friend {FirstName} who found Ben Gong's disciple, I'm afraid that Elder Chongxu would be in charge of the Star Palace in a few days?
不多时，林沐心已是赶来。经过你的简单介绍后，她便是给星铃儿详细讲述冲虚散人此前在林府的作为，以及她的怀疑。¤Not long after, Lin Muxin arrived. After your brief introduction, she gave Xing Linger a detailed account of Chongxu Sanren's previous actions in Lin Mansion and her suspicions.
不...不敢...我，我只是为了星宫，对，为了星宫着想。若是让林家继续...¤No...don't dare...I, I'm just for the Star Palace, yes, for the Star Palace's sake. If the Lin family is allowed to continue...
只一揭开封口，便有花香夹带着清冽的酒香充满整个房间。两女本就是天生尤物，被这酒气一衬，更是娇艳万状。¤As soon as the seal was opened, the fragrance of flowers filled the whole room with a refreshing aroma of wine. The two women are born stunners, and they are even more delicate and beautiful when they are lined by this wine.
终于，冲虚散人的师父，星宫大长老无惑真人赶到了林家长老殿。¤Finally, the master of Chongxu Sanren, Xinggong Grand Elder Wuhuo, arrived at the Lin Clan Elder Hall.
如今星宫才几位元婴长老，而我和师父已是占了其二，林家还是识趣些罢。¤Now there are only a few Nascent Soul elders in the Xinggong, and Master and I have already taken the second place. The Lin family should be more knowledgeable.
看你一副悉听遵命的样子，星铃儿脸上尽是满足。倒是林沐心的表情有些古怪。¤Seeing how you obeyed your orders, Xing Ling'er's face was full of satisfaction. However, Lin Muxin's expression was a little weird.
何故致此，还不从实招来？¤Why is this, not from the truth?
宫主看似溺爱地揉了揉星铃儿的头发，惹得后者一阵白眼，但也未再抱怨什么。¤The palace lord rubbed Xing Ling'er's hair dotingly, causing the latter to roll his eyes, but he didn't complain any more.
我这就差人去给道友准备醉仙酿。¤I will send someone to prepare Drunk Immortal Brew for fellow Daoists.
苗矮长老素来口直心快，当年已是见识过了。¤Elder Miao Ai has always been straightforward and straightforward, and he had already seen it back then.
筑基金丹修士在这道尖啸下都是一阵眩晕，其中中抵抗力较差者与练气修士等更是失去意识，瘫倒在地。¤The cultivator of building foundation pills was all dizzy under this scream, and among them, those with poor resistance and qi training cultivators lost consciousness and collapsed to the ground.
冲虚前辈不过是给林家找了个莫须有的罪名罢，林家是否管理不善，你我皆知。¤Senior Chongxu just found an unwarranted charge for the Lin family. Whether the Lin family is not well managed, you and I both know.
星铃儿毫不客气地打断并“善解人意”地“帮”你说出想说的话，一副对情况已是十分了解的样子，但你也不敢松懈，毕竟这丫头可不是这么好相与的类型，即便这事其实与她也是相关。¤Starling interrupts unceremoniously and 'kindly' 'helps' you to say what you want to say, as if you already know the situation very well, but you do not dare to relax, after all, this girl is not such a good type, even if this matter is actually related to her.
放心，去云汐城要坛酒而已，还不是简简单单。¤Don't worry, going to Yunxi City to ask for altar wine is not simple.
不好不好，还是太生分了些，不如叫我铃儿吧。铃儿，铃儿，多好听。¤No, no, it's still too raw, why don't you call me Linger. Bell, Bell, how nice.
本在品尝盈手露的林沐心闻言也是一滞，险些被酒呛住。还好修仙之人有太多方法应对这种尴尬的局面，但还是引起你和星玲儿的注意，后者也是轻笑一声，假装自己完全没有在意。¤Lin Muxin, who was tasting the hand dew, was also stagnant when she heard the words, and almost choked on the wine. Fortunately, there are too many ways to deal with this embarrassing situation, but it still attracted the attention of you and Xing Linger, who also chuckled and pretended that she didn't care at all.
哦？那冲虚长老的意思是本宫来的时机不对，耽误你跟林家内斗了？¤Oh? That elder Chongxu meant that the timing of Ben Gong's arrival was not right, and it delayed you from fighting with the Lin family?
回到林府客房，两女正在房中等候着你。¤Back in the Lin Mansion room, the two women are waiting for you in the room.
（难道{$xing}被这冲虚散人逮到，没能唤宫主出关？）¤(Could it be that {$xing} was caught by this Chong Xu San and failed to call the Palace Master out of the customs?)
只见星宫宫主略一挥手，一道淡金色的屏障出现在你身前。冲虚散人的神识攻击撞上屏障虽是引起表面剧烈波动，乃至整个屏障都在震颤，但终于还是如泥牛入海般消弭无踪。¤I saw the Star Palace Palace Master waved his hand slightly, and a pale golden barrier appeared in front of you. Although the attack of the consciousness of the emptiness rushing into the barrier caused violent fluctuations on the surface, and even the entire barrier trembled, it finally disappeared like a mud ox into the sea.
{size=24}{FirstName}道友这么快就回来了？我可是听说公孙家的人都以精明著称，居然这么好对付。{/size}¤Fellow Daoist {size=24}{FirstName} came back so soon? I heard that the people of the Gongsun family are known for their shrewdness, and they are so easy to deal with. {/size}
没遇到麻烦吧？¤No trouble, right?
另一方坐的却是星玲儿和...¤On the other side are Xing Linger and...
哈，哈哈...的确是我们给星道友造成了麻烦。不知星道友想要我们如何补偿呢？¤Ha, ha ha... It's true that we caused trouble to fellow Star Taoists. I don't know how Xingdao friends want us to make up for it?
倒也不是不行，只是你们传的谣不但害我花了数天时间打听，还在城外以身为饵连日奔波，怎么也得补偿补偿我吧。¤It's not impossible, it's just that the rumors you spread not only cost me a few days of inquiries, but you also run around outside the city as bait for days, so you have to compensate me.
但也如铃儿所言，冲虚你潜力亏空，徒有元婴境之表而无其实。¤But as Ling'er said, if you rush to the emptiness, your potential will be depleted.
（{vpunch=10,0.5}冲虚散人！）¤({vpunch=10,0.5} to rush the vacant people!)
那晚辈就却之不恭了。¤The younger generation was disrespectful.
宫主！请您手下留情！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Palace Lord! Please be merciful! {vpunch=10,0.5}
无惑真人到底是冲虚散人师尊，只凭一句话便是点醒那红着眼似是心魔发作的后者。¤In the end, the Wuhuo real person is the master of the rushing and scattered people, and with just one sentence, he wakes up the latter with red eyes and seems to be having a demon attack.
只一揭开封口，便有花香夹带着清冽的酒香充满整个房间。两女本就是天生尤物，被这酒气一衬，更是娇艳万状。借着逸散开来的酒香，你竟是有些想入非非。¤As soon as the seal was opened, the fragrance of flowers filled the whole room with a refreshing aroma of wine. The two women are born stunners, and they are even more delicate and beautiful when they are lined by this wine. With the aroma of the wine escaping, you are actually a little fanciful.
冲虚散人话音未落，一道不起眼的细长金芒静谧无声地刺向你的眉心！¤Chongxu Sanren's voice has not fallen, an inconspicuous slender golden light pierces your eyebrows quietly and silently!
若真是如此，这冲虚长老确实有问题。但，两位道友以如此大的阵仗引我前来，不仅是为了告诉我此事吧？¤If this is the case, there is indeed a problem with this Chongxu elder. However, the two Daoists led me here with such a big battle, not only to tell me this, right?
一旁的林沐心此时也是在桌旁坐下来，两手撑着脸颊，一副迫不及待的样子。¤Lin Muxin, who was on the side, was also sitting down at the table at this time, with her hands on her cheeks, as if she couldn't wait.
这不是没其他办法联系{$xing}么，情急之下就，嘿嘿。¤Isn't there no other way to contact {$xing}, just in a hurry, hehe.
在林沐心的讲述过程中，星铃儿也是脸上阴晴不定，像是写着“冲虚长老竟会私下里做出这种事”，待林沐心说到怀疑冲虚散人修习了采补功法时，她更是陷入了沉思。¤In the process of Lin Muxin's narration, Xing Linger's face was also uncertain, as if it was written Chongxu elders would do this kind of thing in private, when Lin Muxin said that she suspected that the Chongxu scattered people had practiced harvesting and supplementing exercises. When she was in law, she was even more lost in thought.
面对宫主的发问，冲虚却只是如同死狗般呆滞地瘫在地上，哪还有星宫元婴长老的威风。¤In the face of the Palace Master's question, Chong Xu just slumped on the ground like a dead dog, how could he still have the prestige of Elder Xinggong Yuanying.
但一看林家如今在座尽是金丹修士，唯一的元婴修士丹阳子也不知在哪闭关，她略一犹豫后叹了口气。¤But seeing that the Lin family is now full of Jindan cultivators, and Dan Yangzi, the only Nascent Soul cultivator, didn't know where to retreat, she hesitated for a while and then sighed.
冲虚散人还想说些什么，但终究是咽了下去。¤Chongxu Sanren wanted to say something, but finally swallowed it.
嗯，你们先回宫吧。¤Well, you go back to the palace first.
{FirstName}道友，请移步长老堂议事。¤Fellow Taoist {FirstName}, please move to the Elder Hall to discuss matters.
你跟着苗矮上人优哉游哉地来到长老堂。通羽上人和林沐心毅然在座，看到你进来，他们也是向你点头示意。¤You followed Master Miao Diao to the Elder Hall leisurely and leisurely. Master Tong Yu and Lin Muxin were present resolutely, and when they saw you coming in, they also nodded to you.
你这只能欺负金丹期的元婴修士，也就能窝里横了，走出去真是丢星宫的脸！¤You can only bully the Nascent Soul cultivator of the Jindan stage, and you can also be in the nest. Going out is really a disgrace to the Star Palace!
苗矮就这性子，道友请勿怪罪。¤Miao Ai has this temperament, fellow Daoists please don't blame him.
哼，若不是我在外游历，早就解决这两个糟老头子带来的麻烦了。林家可是星宫不可分割的一部分，哪能轮到他俩肆意妄为。¤Hmph, if I hadn't traveled abroad, I would have solved the troubles caused by these two bad old men long ago. The Lin family is an inseparable part of the Star Palace, how could it be their turn to act recklessly.
在此期间，冲虚散人若是再次违背宫规，本宫绝不会放过你第二次。¤During this period, if Chongxu Sanren violates the rules of the palace again, this palace will never let you go a second time.
待你反应过来，距离已不过数尺！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤By the time you react, the distance is only a few feet away! {vpunch=10,0.5}
星宫宫主正待出手击毙冲虚散人，一道男性修士的声音从远处传来，情急之下甚至忘了用神识传音，而是以灵力加持，如尖啸般传遍长老堂在座各位，林府甚至整个天星城的所有人耳中。¤The Palace Master of the Star Palace was about to kill the Chongxu Sanren. A male cultivator's voice came from a distance. In desperation, he even forgot to use his spiritual sense to transmit the sound. Instead, he used spiritual power to bless him, and it spread throughout the elders hall like a shriek. Everyone here, everyone in the Lin Mansion and even in the entire Sky Star City.
苗矮上人待你起身方才在前引路，领头走向长老堂。¤Master Miao Ai waited for you to get up before leading the way, leading to the presbytery.
怎么，冲虚长老是觉得本宫不能来这里？¤Why, Elder Chongxu thinks that Ben Gong can't come here?
看在大长老的面上，此事暂时就这样吧。先收回冲虚散人此前作为星宫长老的职权，贬为内门弟子，闭门思过至丹阳子出关后，再行讨论是否要追加其他处罚。¤From the perspective of the Great Elder, this is the case for the time being. First, take back Chongxu Sanren's previous powers as the elders of the Xing Palace, demoted to inner disciples, and think about it behind closed doors until Danyangzi leaves the customs, and then discuss whether to add other punishments.
哼，你当年明明是想强行与我结为道侣，怎么能算好事！应该是多亏{FirstName}{$NickName}暗中调查，才没让你这小人奸计得逞！¤Hmph, you obviously tried to forcefully form a daoist couple with me back then, how can that be considered a good thing! It should be thanks to {FirstName}{$NickName}'s secret investigation that you didn't let this villain succeed in his treacherous plan!
你不是林家修士..但我好像见过你...那年也是你在从中作梗！是你坏我好事！是你...是你挑拨星宫与分支林家的关系！对，就是你！¤You are not a cultivator of the Lin family.. but I seem to have met you... that year, you were also making trouble! It's you who ruined my good things! It's you... it's you who provoked the relationship between the star palace and the branch Lin family! Yes, it's you!
星道友是我好友，而心儿却是我道侣，自然是有所不同。¤Fellow Daoist Xing is my friend, while Xin'er is my Taoist companion, so naturally it is different.
没想到这么多年过去，林家还要仰仗道友相助，老夫作为林府大长老反倒因实力不足只能旁观，哎，真是后生可畏啊。¤I didn't expect that after so many years, the Lin family would still have to rely on you to help them, but as the Grand Elder of the Lin House, I can only watch from the sidelines due to my lack of strength.
星宫宫主轻捏法诀，你身前的金色屏障又化作数枚金针，在她的厉啸中无声地刺向冲虚散人。¤The Palace Master of the Star Palace gently squeezed the magic formula, and the golden barrier in front of you turned into several golden needles, silently stabbing at the rushing vacant person in her scream.
急于转移话题的冲虚散人像是找到了发泄点，开始状若疯狂地向你嘶吼。¤Chongxu San, who was eager to change the subject, seemed to have found a vent and began to yell at you like a frantic.
大长老对星宫的贡献，本宫自是记在心底，但你这徒儿顽劣只怕纵是我愿给机会，他也不会珍惜罢。¤The first elder's contribution to the Star Palace, Ben Gong naturally remembers it in the bottom of my heart, but you are stubborn, I am afraid that even if I am willing to give the opportunity, he will not cherish it.
算你有理，不过星道友终归是太生分了些，还是叫我星姑娘吧。¤You're right, but fellow Xing Daoist is too detached after all, so call me Xing girl.
眼见这星铃儿是明眸秋波转，雪肌透红霞，一副楚楚可怜的样子。你也只好气御酒坛，满上三盏。¤Seeing that Xing Ling'er's bright eyes turned bright, her snowy muscles were rosy, she looked pitiful. You also had no choice but to hold the wine jar full of three cups.
除非父亲能及时归来，不然只怕林家在天星城的地位要一落千丈。¤Unless my father can return in time, I am afraid that the Lin family's status in Tianxing City will plummet.
无惑真人如蒙大赦，领着冲虚散人迅速离去了，场中只留下了你，林家众人和星宫宫主、星铃儿师徒。¤Wuhuo Zhenren felt as if he had been granted amnesty, and led the Chongxu scattered people away quickly, leaving only you, the Lin family, the Xinggong Palace Master, and Xing Linger's master and apprentice.
你收下星宫秘术之后便是寒暄一会。不多时，星宫宫主就带星铃儿离去了。¤After you accept the Star Palace Secret Art, you will chat for a while. Not long after, the Palace Master of the Star Palace took Xing Linger away.
你也适时拿出一坛极品盈手露放在桌上，灵力稍一激发，将泥封震裂，散落的碎渣也是被灵力尽皆荡开。¤You also took out a jar of top-quality hand dew and placed it on the table at the right time. When the spiritual power was stimulated a little, the mud seal was cracked, and the scattered slag was also swept away by the spiritual power.
眼见星铃儿终于是心满意足地离去，林沐心呆滞了片刻也是离开了客房，不知去向。¤Seeing that Xing Linger finally left with satisfaction, Lin Muxin left the guest room after being sluggish for a moment, not knowing where to go.
天星城的醉仙酿就我早就喝腻了。倒是听说云汐城的盈手露很是不错，可惜公孙家很是吝啬，导致极品盈手露很少在市场上出现，若是上门讨要又拿人手短。所以嘛，就拜托{FirstName}道友咯~¤I am tired of drinking the drunk fairy brew in Tianxing City. However, I heard that Yunxi City's Yingshoulu is very good, but unfortunately the Gongsun family is very stingy, so that the best Yingshoulu rarely appears in the market. So, please ask fellow Taoist {FirstName}~
哼，就凭你这伪元婴还想解决我？看不起谁呢！¤Hmph, you still want to solve me just because of you fake Nascent Soul? Who do you look down on!
一道柔和的女声从长老堂正门传了进来，饶是在这灵气风暴中，也稳稳的传入在座诸位的耳中。¤A soft female voice came in from the main entrance of the Elder Hall. Rao was in this storm of spiritual energy, and it also steadily entered the ears of everyone present.
手下败将，安敢逞能！¤The defeated generals, An dare to be brave!
不要客气了，若不是有你在，我都不知此事该如何收场。¤Don't be polite, if it weren't for you, I don't know how this matter would end.
宫主叹了口气，朗声道。¤The palace lord sighed and said loudly.
哼，通羽你就别倚老卖老了，再过个几十年，我们指不定就要叫一声{FirstName}前辈了。¤Hmph, Tongyu, don't rely on the old to sell the old, and in a few decades, we may be called senior {FirstName}.
怎么，林家终于是知错了？¤What, the Lin family finally knew it was wrong?
孽徒！犯下此等大错还不知悔改，真是要{size=32}寻死{/size}不成！¤Evil! To commit such a big mistake without repenting, I really want to {size=32}chasing my death{/size}!
那我便先回星宫了，你们去林府等我好消息吧。¤Then I will go back to the Star Palace first. You can go to the Lin Mansion and wait for my good news.
冲虚散人嘴上说着，法宝已是吞吐着灵气蓄势待发。其上散发着的灵气，让原本平静的屋内以他为中心点，掀起一股灵气风暴。¤Chongxu Sanren said, the magic weapon is already swallowing aura and ready to go. The aura emanating from it caused a storm of aura centered on him in the originally peaceful house.
通羽上人则是一脸平静注视着冲虚散人。而你和林沐心迷茫地看向星玲儿，不知她又在打什么鬼主意。¤Master Tongyu watched Chongxu Sanren with a calm expression on his face. And you and Lin Muxin looked at Xing Linger in confusion, wondering what the hell she was up to.
若是现在把天星城管辖权交出来，等宫主出关，我还给你们美言几句，劝宫主不追究丹阳子那老鬼管理不周的责任，否则嘛，哼哼。¤If you hand over the jurisdiction of Tianxing City now, and wait for the Palace Master to leave the customs, I will give you a few good words to persuade the Palace Master not to hold the old ghost Danyangzi responsible for his poor management, otherwise, hehe.
宫...宫主...你，你怎么来了...¤Palace... Palace Master... You, why are you here...
不...不敢，宫主想去的地方自然是能去的。¤No... No, I can go wherever the Palace Master wants to go.
{FirstName}小友，此次还得感谢你在中穿针引线。否则，等本宫出关，星宫不知要被这冲虚散人折腾成什么样子。¤Little friend {FirstName}, I have to thank you for threading the needle this time. Otherwise, when Ben Gong exits the customs, Xing Gong does not know what it will be like to be tossed by this Chongxu scattered person.
宫主，您看在老朽为星宫尽心尽力数百年的份上，还请放这孽徒一马。¤Palace Master, for the sake of this old man who has worked hard for the Star Palace for hundreds of years, please let this scoundrel go.
半盏茶时间后，苗矮长老到来。¤After half a cup of tea, Elder Miao Ai arrived.
而星铃儿则是熟练的将三个不知名材质的青色小盏列于桌上。你还在为她拿出三个小盏惊讶时，星铃儿却眨巴着眼睛看向你。¤On the other hand, Xing Linger skillfully placed three small cyan cups of unknown material on the table. When you were still surprised by taking out three small cups for her, Xing Linger blinked and looked at you.
苗矮上人满脸不忿地看着冲虚散人，只是上次受的伤虽不算太严重但也还未痊愈，当下也是敢怒不敢言。¤Master Miao Ai looked at Chongxu Sanren with a face full of resentment, but the injury he suffered last time was not too serious, but it had not yet healed, and now he dared not speak out.
你一边说着，旁边的林沐心一边理所当然地喝着盈手露，只是传递给你一个“算你识相”的眼神。¤While you were talking, Lin Muxin, who was next to him, drank Yingshoulu as a matter of course, but just passed on a look of you know your physique.
好，遵命，{$xing}。¤All right, as ordered, {$xing}.
所以就想找我帮忙请师父出关咯。¤So I wanted to ask for my help to ask Master to go out.
哼，哼哼，看来上次的教训还没让你反省，也好，就让我再好好教育教育你。¤Hum, hum, it seems that the last lesson has not made you reflect on it, or you can let me educate you more.
哼，通羽你就别倚老卖老了，{FirstName}道友可是当年就能击败冲虚散人，你我那时就不一定是他对手。¤Hmph, Tongyu, don't rely on the old and sell the old, but fellow Taoist {FirstName} was able to defeat the Chongxu Sanren back then, you and I were not necessarily his opponents at that time.
这...若是不介意，那我改口叫你星姑娘可好？¤This... If you don't mind, how about I call you Star Girl instead?
星道友，现在酒也给你倒好了，待会是不是该你帮我们了？¤Fellow Daoist Xing, now that the wine has been poured for you, is it time for you to help us later?
在场几位只是相视一笑，便不再拘于此。¤A few people in the room just looked at each other and smiled, and then they were no longer bound to this.
冲虚长老好强的气势，连本宫都为之倾倒了呢。¤Elder Chongxu's aura was so strong that even Ben Gong was overwhelmed by it.
当年老夫便是看着{FirstName}道友为林家解忧，只是还能在一旁帮衬一番。¤Back then, the old man was watching fellow Taoist {FirstName} relieve the Lin family's worries, but he was still able to help out.
不然以后丢林家的脸是小事，可别连带丢了星宫的脸！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Otherwise, it will be a trivial matter to lose the Lin family's face in the future, but don't lose the Xinggong's face! {vpunch=10,0.5}
本念着你师父无惑真人数百年来对星宫贡献匪浅，只想让你认错后悔过自新。但你既是执迷不悟，还当着本宫的面妄图加害{FirstName}小友，那就休怪本宫无情了！¤I thought that your master, Wuhuo Zhenren, has contributed a lot to the Star Palace for hundreds of years, and I just want you to admit your mistakes and regret your reformation. But since you are obsessed and you are still trying to harm the little friend {FirstName} in front of Ben Gong, then don't blame Ben Gong for being ruthless!
星铃儿心里虽是有些嘀咕，但听到你的话语还是轻移莲步转至桌旁坐下。¤Although Xing Ling'er was a little muttered in her heart, she still moved her lotus steps to the table and sat down when she heard your words.
四代子弟冲虚散人，于突破无望时滥用采补邪术残害他人，此举为星宫难容，本宫以星宫宫主星...¤The four generations of children rushed to the vacuous people and abused the magic power of harvesting to harm others when they had no hope of breaking through. This move is intolerable for the star palace.
这位{gongzi}，要参加下一次的拍卖会么？入场费只要500灵石噢~¤This {gongzi}, do you want to participate in the next auction? The entrance fee is only 500 spirit stones~
为了保证拍卖会的质量，我们会请专门的鉴定师对拍品进行鉴定。因此，所有价值低于2000灵石的物品都是不允许在这里寄卖的。¤In order to ensure the quality of the auction, we will ask a special appraiser to appraise the lot. Therefore, all items with a value of less than 2000 spirit stones are not allowed to be sold here.
客官，您上次的客房时间还有剩余，需要再续上么？¤Guest, you still have room time left last time, do you need to renew it?
你刚一退下，公孙季就微笑着走到核心前。¤As soon as you retired, Gongsun Ji smiled and walked to the core.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}又变强了不少啊，我尝试了好几次都无可奈何，居然被你这么随意的破除了。要是有机会，一定要和{FirstName}{xiongdi}切磋切磋。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} has become a lot stronger again. I have tried several times but I have no choice but to get rid of it so casually. If you have the opportunity, you must learn from {FirstName}{xiongdi}.
你巧妙的规避着阵法核心的攻击。好不容易找到个机会，你用尽全力轰击核心。随着一声巨响，核心碎裂开来。¤You cleverly avoided the attack from the core of the formation. Finally, you found an opportunity to bombard the core with all your strength. With a loud noise, the core shattered.
核心不断地攻击着公孙季的阵法，却没有什么明显的效果。待前者的攻击慢下来后，公孙季一声大喝并全力驱动阵法，竟是将核心镇压住，然后拘入自己的储物法宝中。¤The core constantly attacked Gongsun Ji’s formation, but there was no obvious effect. After the attack of the former slowed down, Gongsun Ji shouted and drove the formation with all his strength, actually suppressing the core, and then detained himself. In the storage magic treasure.
你尝试了许久，但还是无法击破阵法核心，只得退下疗伤。¤You tried for a long time, but still couldn't break through the core of the formation, so you had to retreat and heal.
周遭的其他修士也是一脸惊讶的看着你，显然是没想到这个难住他们如此之久的天阵法核心，居然被你轻松击破。¤The other cultivators around are also looking at you with surprise. Obviously, they didn't expect that the core of the sky formation technique that has held them so long would be easily broken by you.
只见他挥手间便布下多重阵法，将阵法核心围困其中。¤When he waved his hand, he set up multiple formations and surrounded the core of the formation.
死~！¤Dead~!
你在山脚下转了一会，便找到了那妖王的巢穴。¤You turned around for a while at the foot of the mountain and found the lair of the demon king.
巢穴深处传来了凶狠的狐叫声。¤A ferocious fox cry came from the depths of the lair.
道友既然来了，何再不与老夫过上两招？¤Since fellow Taoist is here, why don't you have two tricks with the old man?
阁下可敢试试，自己能接老夫几招？¤You dare to try, how can you take the old man?
突然，你汗毛倒立，一道劲风从你背后袭来，你躲闪不及，被重重地拍打到洞壁之上！¤Suddenly, your hairs are standing upside down, and a strong wind hits behind you. You can't dodge, and you are slapped heavily on the cave wall!
你收敛气息，慢慢走进洞窟深处...¤You restrained your breath and slowly walked into the depths of the cave...
此等品阶的草药实乃可遇而不可求之物，可惜你并不是第一个发现它的人，另有一股强大的妖兽气息已经锁定了它。你决定...？{w}{w=0.5}¤This kind of herbal medicine is something you can meet but cannot ask for, but unfortunately you are not the first to find it, and another powerful monster aura has locked it. You decide...? {w }{w=0.5}
（没有必要冒此风险...）¤(There is no need to take this risk...)
蓬莎岛上妖兽材料是最重要的交易货币，修士可以用这些材料和他们换取妖兽情报，有了这些情报，你才能在无尽之海上获得最大的收益。¤The monster materials on Pongsha Island are the most important trading currency. The cultivators can use these materials to exchange monster information with them. With this information, you can obtain the greatest benefits in the endless sea.
我派于宁州传承数万余年，可惜当年的诸多功法神通皆已经失传了。¤Our Sect it to Ning Province for more than tens of thousands of years, but unfortunately many of the magical powers of that year have been lost.
那当然。功法优劣关系到修炼者炼化灵气的速度。阳寿有限，人生苦短，谁不想修炼得快些呢？¤Of course. The pros and cons of the exercises are related to the speed at which the cultivator can refine the spiritual energy. The Yang life is limited and life is short. Who doesn't want to practice faster?
功法还分高低贵贱吗？¤Does the exercises still be divided into high and low?
还来？¤Again?
黑衣人转身想跑，但那离火门修士怎可能让他如愿，漫天业火接踵而至，没过几招，那黑衣人便闷声倒下了¤The man in black turned around and tried to run, but how could the Heavenly Fire Gate cultivator let him do what he wanted?
哼，自寻死路。¤Heck, ask for death.
你不再收敛气息，刚准备出手时，异变陡生。¤You stop reining in your breath and are just about to strike when a strange change occurs.
情形急转直下，面对黑衣人凛冽的攻势，离火门修士眼看就要支撑不住了。¤The situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Faced with the biting attack of the man in black, the Heavenly Fire Gate cultivators are about to lose their support.
要知道，就连九转灵蛇丹这种五品丹药都无法恢复的如此迅速！¤You know, even a fifth-grade Pill like the Nine-Turn Spiritual Snake Pill can't recover so quickly!
这是？风雨楼的招式？¤This is? Wind and Rain Tower's move?
而那同门修士你自然认识，正是管理外务的杨长老。¤And that fellow Daoist you naturally know, it is the management of the external affairs of Elder Yang.
好阴毒的手段？！离火门长老怎会……¤What a sinister tactic? How could the elders of the Heavenly Fire Gate......
只见离火门修士飞速吞下一颗诡异的“丹药”，数息之内，腹部恐怖的伤口便恢复如初，神识威压也陡然攀升了一个境界。¤Just see the Heavenly Fire Gate cultivator quickly swallowed a bizarre pill, within a few breaths, the abdominal horror of the wound will recover as before, the soul sense pressure also steeply climbed a realm.
就在黑衣人惊讶于这“丹药”惊人功效的那一瞬，离火门长老再度变招，强大的神识压制的黑衣人难以招架。¤At the moment when the man in black was surprised by the amazing effect of the pill, the Elder of the Heavenly Fire Gate changed his stance again, and his powerful soul sense overpowered the man in black.
岂止是离火门，在我的印象里，应该只有魔门才会使这种能够瞬间使实力暴涨的手段。¤It's not just the Heavenly Fire Gate, in my impression, only the Demon Sect should be able to use such means that can instantly make the strength skyrocket.
只见两名金丹期修士正打得不可开交。一名身着离火服饰，一手火系神通施展的相当熟练；另一名则黑衣蒙面，所使用的功法也异常狠毒，不似善类。¤Two Jindan stage cultivators were fighting with each other. One was dressed in the costume of a fireman and was skilled in the use of fire magic, while the other was dressed in black and masked, and was using an unusually vicious technique that did not resemble a good fighter.
平日里这些魔门藏头露尾，既然今日被我撞上了，倒是正好看看他们来宁州到底有何企图。¤These demon clans usually hide their heads, but since I've run into them today, it's a good time to see what they're up to in Ning Province.
情形急转直下，面对黑衣人凛冽的攻势，杨长老眼看就要支撑不住了。¤The situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Faced with the biting attack of the man in black, Elder Yang looks like he will not be able to support himself.
还没来得及思考其中端倪，你便感觉脑内一阵刺痛，正对上杨长老冰冷的目光。¤Before you have time to ponder the implications, you feel a stabbing pain inside your head and are confronted by Elder Yang's icy gaze.
一道紫光闪过！只见那黑衣人抓住了一个破绽，一击将离火门修士腹部刺穿，血流不止。¤A flash of purple light! Only to see the man in black catch a break and stab the Heavenly Fire Gate cultivator through the abdomen with a single blow, bleeding profusely.
果然，异变陡生。¤Sure enough, a change came out of nowhere.
那人好像并没有发现你，在捡走黑衣人的储物袋后，便往远处飞驰而去。¤The man doesn't seem to notice you, and after picking up the man in black's storage bag, he speeds off into the distance.
好阴毒的手段？！杨长老怎会...¤What a sinister tactic! How could Elder Yang...
用这种手段提升的实力应该维持不了多久，你且跟上去，等他实力消退之后再作打算罢。¤The strength raised by such means should not last long, so you should follow him and wait until his strength subsides.
可是风雨楼不是只会对声名狼藉之人动手？为何要对付离火门的人？¤But doesn't the Wind and Rain Tower only strike at people of notoriety? Why would they want to deal with people from the Heavenly Fire Gate?
不远处传来了一阵灵力波动，似是有人争斗。你想弄清状况，便收敛气息，靠了过去。¤Not far away comes a wave of spiritual energy, as if someone is fighting. Trying to find out what is going on, you gather your breath and lean over.
魔门？那就有意思了...¤The Devil's Gate? That would be interesting...
此人招式凌厉，贸然出手你也没有十足把握，只是待在原地静观其变。¤This man's moves are so powerful that you are not sure what to do, so just stay put and watch what happens.
奇怪，这人使用的丹药招式都好生诡异，不像是出自离火门...¤Strange, the pills this man uses are so weird, it doesn't look like he's from the Heavenly Fire Gate...
还没来得及思考其中端倪，你便感觉脑内一阵刺痛，正对上那人冰冷的目光。¤Before you have time to ponder the implications, you feel a tingle inside your head and meet the man's icy gaze.
好阴毒的手段？！杨长老怎会……¤What a sinister tactic? How could Elder Yang ......
{FirstName}{gongzi}还有什么想了解的？¤{FirstName}{gongzi} What else do you want to know?
沾染魔气...这让我想起了数百年前覆灭的御剑门。¤Tainted with demonic energy... It reminds me of the Imperial Sword Sect, which was overthrown hundreds of years ago.
这些日子，我也曾听城内散修提起遇到过剑灵伤人的传闻。莫非是这御剑门的遗迹中出现了一些变故...¤Lately, I have also heard rumors from independent cultivators in the city that sword spirits have injured people. Could it be that there have been some changes in the ruins of the Imperial Sword Gate...
御剑门...老仆倒也了解一二。不知{gongzi}是想打听何事？¤The Royal Sword Sect... Old servant does know a thing or two about it. I wonder what {gongzi} wants to inquire about?
少主结丹后，便离家四处游历去了，至今未归。哎，希望少主能改改他那鲁莽的性子...¤After the young master formed the pill, he left home and traveled around. He has not returned yet. Hey, I hope the young master can change his reckless temper...
你将{color=#d0380a}灵气消散的飞剑{/color}交给杨管家，并将自己在路上遭到剑灵袭击的事悉数告知。¤You give {color=#d0380a} the flying sword{/color} whose aura has dissipated to Steward Yang, and tell you all about your being attacked by the sword spirit on the road.
原来如此...多谢杨管家指点。¤So that's it... Thanks to Steward Young for pointing it out.
至于这白帝楼？¤As for this Baidi Tower?
你若对此事感兴趣，我可以把这信物借给你。若是真调查出什么异变，你也可以尽快通知各大门派知晓。¤If you are interested in this matter, I can lend you this token. If you really investigate any changes, you can also inform the various martial arts as soon as possible.
挑选宗门首先应当考虑自身的{color=#d0380a}灵根属性{/color}，若所修神通功法与自身灵根契合，发挥起来自然得心应手。¤When choosing a sect, you should first consider your own {color=#d0380a}spiritual root attributes{/color}. If the magical powers you practice are compatible with your own spiritual roots, they will naturally be handy.
{gongzi}难得光临，不知有何贵干？{w}{w=0.5}¤{gongzi} is a rare visit, I don’t know what you can do? {w}{w=0.5}
{FirstName}{gongzi}若是想了解宁州的各大宗门，老夫倒是能略微指点你一二。¤{FirstName}{gongzi} If you want to know about the major sects in Ning Province, the old man can give you some pointers.
此事有何难，交给我吧！¤How difficult is this, leave it to me!
宗主平时都在白帝楼闭关，俗事就由老仆来打理。{w}{w=0.5}¤The Master usually retreats in Baidilou, and the old servants take care of the common affairs. {w}{w=0.5}
这...老仆倒是未曾听到过什么明确的结论。¤This... The old servant had not heard any definite conclusions.
老管家，我对这次遇到的剑灵很感兴趣，可否借此信物一用？¤Old butler, I am very interested in the sword spirit I encountered this time, can I use this token to use it?
如今暗流涌动，时常有妖物伤人。可惜我倪家除了宗主再无高手，若是以前哪能容这帮妖孽胡作非为？¤Nowadays, undercurrents are surging, and there are often monsters that hurt people. It is a pity that my Ni family has no proficient fighter besides the master. If it was before, how could this group of evildoers behave?
化尘教主修{color=#d0380a}土系{/color}功法，是宁州五大门派之一。往常化尘教每年都会开放宗门以招收弟子，但近年来似乎因为某些缘故谢绝接待外客。若想拜入此派，恐怕还得{color=#d0380a}等上几年{/color}¤Aeonic Sands Temple majors in {color=#d0380a}Earth System{/color} exercises. It is one of the five major schools in Ning Province. In the past, Aeonic Sands Temple opened its sect every year to recruit disciples, but in recent years it seems to have declined for some reason. Receiving foreign visitors. If you want to join this faction, I’m afraid you have to {color=#d0380a}wait a few years{/color}
御剑门的遗址正在九嶷山，不过为了防止凡人误入，这遗迹已经被宁州各大门派用迷阵以及禁制封印了起来。只有宁州各大家族与门派，带着御剑门信物，才能进入那里。¤The ruins of Imperial Sword Sect are in Jiuyi Mountain. However, in order to prevent mortals from entering by mistake, this relic has been sealed up by various sects in Ning Province with mazes and restrictions. Only the major families and sects of Ning Province carry Imperial Sword Sect. A token to enter there.
倪旭欣一口答应替你向他爹打听御剑门相关之事，他留你在倪府{color=#d0380a}客房{/color}休息一日，待他了解情况后再来找你。¤Ni XuXin promised to ask his father about matters related to the Imperial Sword Sect for you, and he left you alone in {color=#d0380a} guest room {/color} to rest for a day, and will  come back to you after he grasp the situation.
哈哈哈哈，详细的，等你获得英杰会魁首，就知道啦。¤Hahahaha, in detail, you'll know when you get the leader of the Elite Club.
离火门主修{color=#d0380a}火系{/color}功法，是宁州五大门派之一。虽然他们从不拒绝散修拜入宗门，但因为恶劣的环境，也很少有人能够在那里坚持下来。¤Heavenly Fire Gate majored in {color=#d0380a}fire Element{/color}. It is one of the five major sects in Ning Province. Although they welcome independent cultivators to enter the sect, but because of the harsh environment, very few people could persist and stay there.
唉，为了英杰会这牌面，府内也只能再省一点。虽然如此，也不能坠了我武陵城倪家的威名。{w}{w=0.5}¤Hey, in order for the hero to meet this card, I can only save a little bit in the mansion. Even so, I can't lose the reputation of the Ni family in Wuling City. {w}{w=0.5}
化尘教主修{color=#d0380a}土系{/color}功法，是宁州五大门派之一。化尘教如今已经恢复了正常，只要能通过化尘教的入门考核，便能拜入宗门。¤Aeonic Sands Temple majoring in {color=#d0380a}Earth System{/color} is one of the five major schools in Ning Province. Aeonic Sands Temple has now returned to normal. As long as it can pass the entrance examination of Aeonic Sands Temple, you can worship Enter the sect.
说来我们倪家与这御剑门也算有些渊源，当年御剑门覆灭后，我们曾收留过一部分幸存的御剑门外门弟子。¤After the destruction of the Royal Sword Sect, we had taken in some of the surviving outer disciples of the Royal Sword Sect.
竹山宗主修{color=#d0380a}木系{/color}功法，是宁州五大门派之一，传承悠久，据说已有数十万年的历史了。¤The Bamboo Mountain Sect majored in {color=#d0380a}Wood{/color} exercises. It is one of the five major schools in Ning Province. It has a long heritage and is said to have a history of hundreds of thousands of years.
不过各宗门招收弟子也有不少特别的规矩，比如有的看重{color=#d0380a}资质{/color}，有的看重{color=#d0380a}悟性{/color}，更有星河剑派这种历来只招收{color=#d0380a}女性{/color}弟子的门派。若是不了解这些，难免会被拒之门外。¤However, there are many special rules for recruiting disciples in each sect. For example, some value {color=#d0380a} aptitude{/color}, some value {color=#d0380a} comprehension{/color}, and even the Galaxy Sword School. This kind of school has always recruited only {color=#d0380a}women{/color} disciples. If you don’t understand this, you will inevitably be turned away.
众人皆知白帝楼与武陵城。城自然出自我们倪家之手。¤Everyone knows the Baidi Tower and Wuling City. The city naturally came from our Ni family.
想当年宗主是何等放浪不羁，如今却为了少爷和家族裹足不前。¤Think about how unruly the Master was, but now he is holding back for the sake of the young master and the family.
{FirstName}阁下，何事？¤Your Excellency {FirstName}, what's the matter?
不过你如今修为尚浅，还是等突破到{color=#d0380a}筑基期{/color}以后再去参与吧。¤However, your cultivation base is still shallow now, so you should wait until the {color=#d0380a}foundation period{/color} before you participate.
话未说完，一把爽朗的声音将你打断。¤Before speaking, a hearty voice interrupted you.
你说这剑灵沾染了魔气，而我看这残剑的形状也与传闻中御剑门弟子的佩剑颇为相似。¤You said that the sword spirit is tainted with demonic energy, and I see that the shape of the sword is also quite similar to the sword of the disciples of the Royal Sword Sect.
既然如此，那我改日......¤In that case, I'll be another day...
私通魔门？那这御剑门到底是和哪个魔门勾结？¤Colluding with a demon clan? Then which demon clan is this Royal Sword Sect colluding with?
当年门庭若市，如今冷冷清清。兴衰轮回，即使是倪氏也不例外啊。{w}{w=0.5}¤At the time, it was quite a market, but now it is deserted. The cycle of prosperity and decline, even the Ni family is no exception. {w}{w=0.5}
哈哈，此事稍后再谈，{FirstName}{xiongdi}这次前来所为何事？¤Haha, I'll talk about this later, what happened to {FirstName}{xiongdi} coming this time?
至今倪府仍有不少人，算得上是当时那些御剑门弟子的后人。不过即便如此，也没有人真的清楚那御剑门勾结魔门的内幕。¤To this day, there are still many people in the Ni House who count themselves as descendants of those disciples of the Imperial Sword Sect at that time. But even so, no one is really clear about the inner workings of that Royal Sword Sect's collusion with the Demon Sect.
金虹剑派主修{color=#d0380a}金系{/color}功法，是宁州五大门派之一。每年金虹剑派都会举办仙资大会，招收外门弟子。但往往只有{color=#d0380a}悟性{/color}高于常人的天才才能被门派所选中。¤The Golden Rainbow Sword Sect majored in {color=#d0380a}Golden System{/color} exercises. It is one of the five major sects in Ning Province. Every year, the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect holds a Fairy Capital Conference to recruit foreign disciples. But often only {color= #d0380a}Only geniuses with savvy{/color} higher than ordinary people can be selected by the martial arts.
杨管家，在下此番前来，是为了打听有关御剑门的传闻。¤Steward Yang, I have come here to inquire about rumours about the Royal Sword Sect.
少主已经回府，这会儿...应该就在房里待着吧。¤The young master has returned to the house, right now...should be staying in the room.
没想到我们倪家会发生这种事...倒是让{gongzi}见笑了。¤I didn't expect this to happen to our Ni family...it made {gongzi} laugh.
星河剑派主修{color=#d0380a}水系{/color}功法，是宁州五大门派之一。每年星河剑派都会开启星河剑阵进行测试，招收外门弟子。但此门派似乎只招收资质优上的{color=#d0380a}女{/color}弟子。¤The Galaxy Sword Sect majored in {color=#d0380a}Water System{/color} exercises. It is one of the five major schools in Ning Province. Every year, the Galaxy Sword Sect opens the Galaxy Sword Array for testing and recruits foreign disciples. But this school seems to only Recruit {color=#d0380a}female{/color} disciples with excellent qualifications.
嗯...此事倒也不算什么辛秘。这御剑门是数百年前因为{color=#d0380a}私通魔门{/color}，而被宁州五大门派一起围攻而亡的。战况之惨烈，当年在宁州可谓无人不知无人不晓。¤Well... This matter is not really a secret. The Royal Sword Sect was besieged and killed by the five major sects in Ning Province hundreds of years ago because of {color=#d0380a}fornication with the Demon Sect{/color}. The battle was so fierce that no one in Ning Province knew about it back then.
这件事各大门派年长些的长老应该都是知情的，只不过近年来极少有人提起，你们这些年轻一辈的弟子不知情倒也正常。¤The older elders of the sects should have been aware of this matter, but it has rarely been mentioned in recent years, so it is only natural that you younger disciples do not know about it.
恭迎少主历练回府，此行可有收获？¤Respectfully welcome the young master to go back to the mansion, can this trip be rewarding?
这信物倒也不是什么珍贵之物...御剑门内那些珍贵的功法与法宝早在数百年前就已经被瓜分一空，我们倪家也已经很多年没有人去过那里了。¤This token is not a precious thing... Those precious techniques and magic treasures within the Royal Sword Sect were divided up hundreds of years ago, and no one from our Ni family has been there for many years.
细细想来，真的很羡慕家主能够拜入白帝门下啊~¤Thinking about it carefully, I really envy the Patriarch to be able to worship Baidi~
至于那封印遗迹所用的阵法...据老仆所知，是那云汐城{color=#d0380a}公孙家{/color}协助五大派布下的。此中玄妙，就不是老仆能说的清的了。¤As for the formation used to seal the relic... As far as my old servant knows, it was set up by the {color=#d0380a}Gongsun Family{/color} of Yun Shi City to assist the five sects. The mystery of this is beyond what an old servant can say.
少爷有时是急性子，{gongzi}与他同行还请多多海涵。{w}{w=0.5}¤Young Master is sometimes impatient, {gongzi} would like to go with him, please help me.{w}{w=0.5}
只要能通过竹山宗外门擂台的考核，便能拜入宗门。这外门考核虽说不如英杰会竞争激烈，但每年能通过考核的人数也是百里出一。若想拜入竹山宗，还是要做足准备才行。¤As long as you can pass the assessment of the Outer Gate of Bamboo Mountain Sect, you can worship the Sect. Although this outer gate is not as competitive as Yingjie, the number of people who can pass the assessment each year is one in a hundred. If you want to worship Bamboo Mountain Sect, You still have to be fully prepared.
终有一日，少爷需要担起家族的盛名。只盼他早些明白主人的苦心……{w}{w=0.5}¤One day, the young master will need to take on the fame of the family. I only hope that he will understand the master’s pains early...{w}{w=0.5}
少主筑基后，便离家四处游历去了，至今未归。哎，希望少主能改改他那鲁莽的性子...¤After the young master built the foundation, he left home and traveled around. He has not returned. Hey, I hope the young master can change his reckless temper...
杨管家能否告知，御剑门当年是为何会被灭门的，又为何连遗迹都要用阵法封印起来？¤Can Steward Yang tell us why the Imperial Sword Sect was exterminated back then, and why even the relics were sealed up with formations?
本想找倪家主打听御剑门之事，不想家主仍未出关，我还是改日再来叨扰吧。¤I wanted to ask Patriarch Ni to inquire about Imperial Sword Sect, but I didn't want Patriarch to leave the customs. I'd better come to bother another day.
哈哈哈，这可是我辈剑修圣地之一，天地人三才剑法，人剑以己身之力御体，地剑以地煞之力砺剑，天剑以天罡之力振气，三剑相应生生不息，攻势既能连绵不绝也可一剑破敌，能创出此等剑法，白帝前辈当真九州剑修第一人！¤Hahaha, this is one of the sacred places of sword repair in my generation. Heaven, earth and man have three swordsmanships. Human swords use their own power to control the body. Correspondingly, the offensive can be endless, and the offensive can also break the enemy with one sword, and can create this kind of swordsmanship. Senior Baidi is really the first person in the Kyushu swordsmanship!
一晃这么些年，少爷长成主人那般仪表堂堂，老仆却老了。{w}{w=0.5}¤After so many years, the young master has grown into the master's appearance, but the old servant has grown old. {w}{w=0.5}
说起这宁州的大派，当以竹山宗，离火门，金虹剑派，星河剑派和化尘教五大派为首，不知{FirstName}{gongzi}想先了解哪个门派？¤Speaking of the big sects in Ning Province, the five sects of Bamboo Mountain Sect, Heavenly Fire Gate, Radiant Sword Sect, Celestial River Sect and Shifting Sands School should be at the top. I wonder which sect {FirstName}{gongzi} would like to know first?
这柄残剑的造型极为独特，如果我没有记错的话，这应该是数百年前覆灭的御剑门弟子配剑。¤The shape of this remnant sword is extremely unique, and if I remember correctly, it should be the sword assigned to a disciple of the Imperial Sword Sect that was overthrown hundreds of years ago.
杨管家，{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你们莫非是在聊我的风流轶事？¤Steward Yang, {FirstName}{xiongdi}, are you talking about my romantic anecdotes?
届时，上界也会降下仙灵之气以供{$师祖}渡劫使用，¤At that time, the higher realms will also send down immortal spiritual qi for {$师祖} to use during the tribulation.
等等，你究竟是用了何种敛息的法门，我竟丝毫气息都没有察觉？¤Wait, what kind of breath-holding technique are you using that I don't even notice?
雷劫本身便蕴含天道的力量，只有用同样蕴含天道的力量才能与之抗衡。¤The tribulation itself contains the power of the heavenly dao, and can only be countered with the same power that contains the heavenly dao.
讲述者¤Narrator
你，可愿出手？¤Would you, of all people, like to play?
你二人又寒暄了几句。相互道别后，你身形一晃，便消失在了大殿内。¤The two of you exchange a few more pleasantries. After bidding each other farewell, you sway and disappear into the great hall.
好说，{shidi}想了解什么，我定然倾囊相授。¤Well, I'm sure I can teach you anything you want to know about {shidi}.
而寻常法术的力量与仙术、雷劫相比根本不在一个层次，就算最强的神通，在雷劫之下都显得脆弱不堪。¤And the power of ordinary spells is not at all on the same level as that of immortal spells or thunderclaps; even the strongest divine abilities appear fragile under a thunderclap.
既然{shidi}想问的都问完了，我倒有个问题想问{shidi}。¤Now that {shidi} has asked what he wanted to ask, I do have a question for {shidi}.
掌门正在案前处理宗门事宜，全然没有发现你的到来。不得已，你只得故意制造出一些声响。¤The Sect Master was dealing with sect matters in front of the case and all but missed your arrival. You had no choice but to deliberately make some noise.
{$掌门}请讲。¤{$掌门} please speak.
而感悟天道与仙灵之气运用之法的地方，名曰太虚。¤And the place where one feels the way of using the heavenly dao and the immortal spirit is called Great Void Dimension.
所以前辈们大都是在一处灵气充裕的僻静之地，而不是海上这种灵气紊乱的地方渡劫。¤That is why most of the predecessors crossed their tribulations in a secluded place with abundant spiritual energy, not in a place like the sea where spiritual energy is disturbed.
当倒计时结束，{$师祖}无论身处何地，天劫都会找上门来。¤When the countdown is over, {$师祖} will come to you wherever you are.
那为何渡劫必须要使用仙术？¤Then why is it necessary to use immortal magic to cross the tribulation?
万物运行之法则，功法神通之根源，也皆为天道。¤The laws by which all things operate, the roots of the divine powers, are also the heavenly paths.
听完此话，掌门直起了身，神情也缓和了下来。¤After hearing this, the patriarch straightened up and his expression eased.
听完此话，他释然而笑。¤After hearing this, he smiled with relief.
这是自然。¤It's natural.
他笔直地看着你，而你自然也明白他的意思。气氛有些微妙。¤He looks at you pensively, and naturally you understand what he means. The atmosphere is a little delicate.
原来如此，此番劳烦{$掌门}了。¤So that's how it is... I'm sorry to bother {$掌门} on this one.
灵气越充裕的地方，渡劫便越容易成功；反之，灵气越杂乱的地方，渡劫便越难。¤The more abundant the aura, the easier it is to succeed in crossing the tribulation; conversely, the more chaotic the aura, the more difficult it is to cross the tribulation.
倘若宗门有难，我必然不会坐视不理。¤If the clan is in trouble, I will not sit idly by and do nothing.
这个自然，{$师祖}想了解什么，在下定然知无不言。¤This is natural, and I will certainly tell you whatever {$师祖} wants to know.
想必掌门也心知肚明，此次前来，我主要是想向掌门询问些事宜。¤I'm sure you know that, but I'm here to ask you about something.
而每动用一次领域的力量，天劫便会提前一百年，所以大多数化神修士都不希望相互之间产生纠纷，而是选择闭关修炼，不争世事。¤And since every time the power of the realm is used, the heavenly tribulation is brought forward by a hundred years, most Deity Transformation cultivators do not wish to create disputes among themselves, choosing instead to close their doors and cultivate without fighting over worldly affairs.
在化神成功的那一刻，你应该便感应到了天劫的存在。¤The moment you succeeded in Deity Transformation, you should have sensed the presence of the heavenly tribulation.
见此情形，掌门瞬间便明白了事情的原委，便识趣地退至一旁，不再说话。¤Seeing this, the master instantly understood what was going on, so he wisely stepped aside and said no more.
仙术是调动仙灵之气所施展的法术。¤An immortal spell is a spell cast by mobilising immortal spirit energy.
我派既然底蕴深厚，可有其他前辈留下的经验以供参考？¤Given the depth of our school's heritage, do we have any experience left behind by other predecessors for reference?
师兄。¤Brother.
你身形一晃，便消失在了大殿内。¤With a shake of your body, you disappear into the Great Hall.
凡俗之礼就不必了，此次前来，只是想向掌门询问些事宜。¤No need for mundane rituals. I just want to ask the Master about some matters.
此前你二人早已相互有所感应，便无需多言，径直向大殿内走了过去。¤The two of you had sensed each other long before this, so you did not need to say anything more and walked straight towards the Great Hall.
老祖¤Old Ancestor
倘若此时，本宗、乃至整个宁州受到前所未有的威胁…¤If, at this time, our clan, and indeed the whole of Ning Province, is under unprecedented threat...
原来是{FirstName}{shidi}，此次前来所为何……¤Originally {FirstName}{shidi}, what did you come for this time ......
天劫是一种考验。无论修为资质寿元如何，从化神成功的那一瞬间开始，便都只有千年时间准备与天劫抗衡。¤The heavenly tribulation is a test. Regardless of one's cultivation qualifications and longevity, from the moment one succeeds in Deity Transformation, one only has a thousand years to prepare to fight against the heavenly tribulation.
此外，渡劫之地的选择也是极为重要。¤In addition, the choice of the place of crossing is also extremely important.
是，恭送{$师祖}。¤Yes, congratulations to {$师祖}.
想必师兄也心知肚明，此次前来，我主要是想向掌门询问些事宜。¤I'm sure you know what I'm talking about, but I'm here to ask you about something.
以{$师祖}目前的神识强度，想必已经能轻易穿过苍穹了吧？¤With {$师祖}'s current strength of soul sense, he must have been able to pass through the firmament easily, right?
{FirstName}{shidi}，我已等候你多时了。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, I have been waiting for you for a long time.
仙术种类繁多，没有人能参悟所有仙术，每个人都只能在自己擅长的领域，寻找对抗天劫的方法。¤There are so many different kinds of immortal arts that no one can comprehend them all, and everyone can only find a way to fight against the heavenly tribulation in the area in which they specialise.
如今{$师祖}已然是我派最强，倘若宗门有难，{$师祖}可愿出手相助？¤Now that {$师祖} is the strongest in our sect, if the sect is in trouble, would {$师祖} be willing to help?
？！是谁？¤? Who is it?
在看清那人样貌之后，掌门又变得恭敬起来。¤After seeing what the man looked like, the paladin became respectful again.
据史料记载，灵气越充裕的地方，渡劫便越容易成功；反之，灵气越杂乱的地方，渡劫便越难。¤According to historical records, the more abundant the spiritual energy is, the easier it is to succeed in crossing the tribulation; conversely, the more chaotic the spiritual energy is, the more difficult it is to cross the tribulation.
多谢师兄，但这凡俗之礼就不必了。¤Thank you, Brother, but this mundane gift is not necessary.
所以{$师祖}们大都是在一处灵气充裕的僻静之地，而不是海上这种灵气紊乱的地方渡劫。¤That's why {$师祖}'s are mostly in a secluded place with abundant spiritual energy, rather than a place like the sea where spiritual energy is disturbed.
原来如此，我都知道了。¤I see, I know all about it.
掌门¤The Master
{shidi}，恭喜。¤{shidi}, congratulations.
掌门在大殿正门处望着你，俨然也是化神境界。¤The Master is looking at you from the main entrance of the Great Hall, as if you too were in the Deity Transformation.
而这苍穹之外，皆为太虚。¤And beyond this vault of heaven is all too much emptiness.
这仙灵之气，必须要对天道有着极深的感悟才可调动，寻常招式根本毫无用武之地。¤This Immortal Spiritual Qi can only be mobilised if one has a profound understanding of the Heavenly Dao; ordinary moves are useless.
化神修士可以轻易地在修炼的同时神游太虚，也只有在太虚之中，{$师祖}才能领悟天道，从而掌握渡劫所必须的仙术。¤A Deity transformation cultivators can easily travel in the Great Void Dimension while cultivating, and it is only in the Great Void that {$师祖} can comprehend the Heavenly Dao and thus master the immortal arts necessary for transmigration.
你并没有解释，只是释放出了一丝化神的威压，他的神情便瞬间变的紧张起来。¤You didn't explain, but merely released a hint of the pressure of a Deity Transformation, and his expression instantly turned tense.
而这一切，自然也被你看在眼里。¤And all this, naturally, was seen by you as well.
首先还是要恭喜{FirstName}{shidi}。¤First of all, congratulations are still in order for {FirstName}{shidi}.
多谢掌门，但这凡俗之礼就不必了。¤Thank you, Master, but this mundane gift is not necessary.
你不想浪费时间，身形一闪，便出现在大殿上。¤You don't want to waste time, and with a flash of your body, you appear in the Great Hall.
他随即意识到了情况不对。¤He then realised that something was not right.
哈哈哈哈，{shidi}能这么说，我便放心了。¤Hahahahaha, I'm relieved {shidi} can say that.
你待会便知道了。¤You'll find out later.
就算仅窥得一丝天道，所领悟的仙术便能轻易超越世间任何神通。¤Even if one has only a glimpse of the heavenly dao, the immortal arts one comprehends can easily surpass any divine power in the world.
天道便是诸条大道的尽头。所谓大道归一，所归之处即为天道。¤The Way of Heaven is the end of all the great paths. As the saying goes, where the Great Dao returns to one, the place where it returns is the Heavenly Dao.
如今你已达到化神境界，宁州屈指可数的存在，再也没有人可以制约你。¤Now that you have reached the Realm of the Deity Transformation, one of the few existences in Ning Province, there is no one left to restrain you.
此等喜事，在下这就昭告天下，届时全宁州的能人志士都会前来恭贺{$师祖}！¤Such a happy event, I will announce it to the world, then all the capable people in Ning Province will come to congratulate {$师祖}!
如此，在下便放心了。¤In that case, I am relieved.
若史料记载无误，{$师祖}应该已经感应到了天劫的存在。¤If the historical records are correct, {$师祖} should have already sensed the presence of the heavenly calamity.
你看出掌门此番用意，只是释然一笑。¤You can see that the master's intentions, but only a smile of relief.
按照惯例，此等喜事应当昭告天下，让全宁州的能人志士前来道贺。¤According to the usual practice, such a happy event should be announced to the world, so that the whole Ning Province capable people come to congratulate.
一道人影突然出现在掌门身后，察觉到异样的掌门猛然转过身来。¤A silhouette suddenly appeared behind the master, sensing the strange master turned around violently.
你……？不对，{$师祖}竟已突破到化神境界？¤You ......? No, {$师祖} has actually broken through to the Deity Transformation realm?
掌门双手作揖，低下了头，俨然露出一副严肃的神情。¤The master bowed his hands and lowered his head, just like showing a serious look.
既然{$师祖}已经满意了，在下却有个不情之请。¤Since {$师祖} is already satisfied, I however have an unrequited request.
恭迎师祖，不知师祖出关所为何事？¤I would like to welcome Master Ancestor, I wonder what is the reason for Master Ancestor to come out of seclusion?
{$师祖}可大致理解为一种极为浓郁的灵气，但又有一些本质的区别。¤{$师祖} can be roughly understood as an extremely dense spiritual energy, but there are some essential differences.
嗯，今后传音符联系。¤Well, in the future, the transmitter contact.
召集大家来此，是有一件大事宣布。¤I have called you all here to make a big announcement.
{xiaozi}，这玩意儿你也乱吃啊？¤{xiaozi}, you eat this stuff indiscriminately too, huh?
大护法怎的今日一反常态允许我们外门进入总坛？¤Why did the Grand Guardian uncharacteristically allow us outer sect disciples to enter the main altar today?
（这不是就外面血池的阵法么。）¤(Isn't this the formation just outside the blood pool.)
起！¤Get up!
别叫我玄蛊，重新认识一下本座古神教大护法玄骨。¤Don't call me Xuan Compulsion, get reacquainted with my seat, Xuan Bone, the Grand Guardian of the Ancient God Sect.
是啊，平日里总坛的人神神秘秘的防着我们。¤Yes, normally the people at the General Temple are secretive and guarded against us.
哎呦，还有漏网之鱼？¤Oops, there's still a leak?
你要干什么？¤What do you want?
炼妖散已经有了突破性进展，妖化的问题已经得到了解决，品阶最高的炼妖散甚至可以辅助蜕凡化神的过程。¤There has been a breakthrough in the Demon Refining Pill, the problem of demonisation has been solved, and the highest grade Demon Refining Pill can even assist in the process of Deity Transformation.
说完他着重看了一眼你背后的剑。¤After saying this he focuses on the sword on your back.
（不对劲此地是个庞大的阵法，周围那些这些人都深陷阵中了。）¤(Something is not right this place is a huge formation and all those people around are deep in it.)
不过今天我没空陪你玩，这炼妖散可是我临门一脚的关键呢。¤But I don't have time to play with you today. This Demon Refining Scatter is the key to my proverbial kick in the pants.
你也是一阵眩晕眼前一黑。¤You, too, have a moment of vertigo and blackness before your eyes.
吼！！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤HOORAY!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
但是，如果人族修士的精血替代一部分兽血就可以中和这个部分。¤However, this part can be neutralised if the essence blood of a human cultivator replaces part of the beast's blood.
掌门？？！！您不是已经突破失败兵解了吗？¤Master? Haven't you already broken through to failed soldier disintegration?
不过还是需要诸位帮我一个小忙的，炼妖散仅以妖兽精血炼制受用者必会兽性大发，¤However, I still need you all to do me a small favour. The Demon Refining Pill is only made from the blood of Spirit Beasts, and the recipient will be bestial.
（作为宗门大殿，有阵法不是很正常么？）¤(As a clan hall, isn't it normal to have formations?)
不愧是护法，这炼妖散真的进展神速。¤As expected of a Guardian, this Demon Refining Dispersion is really progressing at a divine pace.
又是你？¤You again?
一会我替你们破开此阵，今日能走几个算几个。¤I will break through this formation for you later, so that as many as you can get away with today.
呵呵，禁术？规矩？我辈修仙之人为何要被这条条框框所拘束？¤Oh, forbidden arts? Rules? Why should we immortal cultivators be bound by such rules and regulations?
护法？？啊！！¤Guardian? Ah!!!
阵内的玄古门弟子几近倒下，只有那名元婴修士率领两个金丹修士在苦苦支撑。¤The Profound Ancient Sect disciples inside the formation nearly collapsed, with only the Yuan Yin cultivator leading two Jin Dan cultivators struggling to hold on.
只见玄骨一掐法诀。¤I only saw Xuan Bone choke out a spell.
看起来玄古门下弟子都聚集此地。¤It looks like the disciples of the Profound Ancient disciples have gathered here.
（此地阵法绝非聚灵防御之流，这里至少包含了一个杀阵一个困阵，而且另有阵法也很眼熟。）¤(The formations here are far from being spirit gathering defences, they contain at least one killing formation and one trapping formation, and another formation looks familiar too.)
掌门，这里就由您帮帮忙了。¤It is up to you to help out here, Master.
而且还是突然召集所有人前来，我闭关都打断了。¤And still, all of a sudden everyone was called to come and my retreat was interrupted.
靠近大殿，就能感觉到人声鼎沸。¤As you approach the Great Hall, you can feel the sound of the crowd.
不错，还在你这。不过今天我没空陪你玩，这炼妖散可是我临门一脚的关键。¤Not bad, you still have it. But I don't have time to play with you today. This Demon Refining Scatter is the key to my proverbial kick in the pants.
走？这一人一个的魔神蛊你们走哪去啊？¤Go? Where are you going to go with this one demon god compulsion?
嗯？护法，以修士精血入药向来是本门禁术你这不合规矩啊，恕我们爱莫能助。¤What? Guardian, using a cultivator's blood to make medicine has always been a forbidden art in our school.
你先担心自己吧。¤You worry about yourself first.
不过无所谓了，帮你们研究了这么多东西，你们也该回报我了。¤But it doesn't matter, after all the research I've done for you, it's time for you to repay me.
掌门，这里就由您替我招待他了。¤Master, you will entertain him here for me.
经历了几天的调查，你感到有些疲惫。玄微剑仙的异样会与倪家家主迟迟未出关有联系吗？¤After a few days of investigation, you feel a little tired. Will the strangeness of Xuanwei Jianxian have something to do with the delay of the Ni family's Patriarch?
一时想不出结果，你决定还是早些就寝等候倪旭欣的消息。¤Unable to think of the result for a while, you decide to go to bed earlier and wait for Ni XuXin's news.
哇！怎么突然开门，吓都要被你吓死啦！¤Wow! Why do you suddenly open the door, you will be scared to death!
多谢{xiongdi}，如此我便先告退了。¤Thank you {xiongdi}, so I will retire first.
至今还未觅得天蝉灵叶的消息，我打算静下心寻找一番。¤I haven't found any news about the Skyscada Leaf so far, so I plan to not rush and scour the land for it.
真不知道从何说起......我爹他确实出事了，始作俑者是二叔。¤I really don't know where to start...My father, he did have an accident. The second uncle was the initiator.
倪兄放心，我绝对守口如瓶。关于天蝉灵叶，若能打听到什么消息我定速来告知。¤Brother Ni, don't worry, I'm absolutely tight-lipped. If I can find anything information on the Skyscada Leaf I will let you know as soon as possible.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}若是有天蝉灵叶的情报也可知会我一声。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} If there is any information about the Skyscada Leaf, please let me know.
进去说进去说，我站得腿都麻了。¤Go in and say, I'm standing with my legs numb.
你第一次看到倪旭欣无精打采的样子，想来此事给了他不小的打击。¤The first time you saw Ni XuXin's listless look, it was a big shock to want to come to him.
长老与中草堂提及的那颗草药，就是给我爹疗伤用的。¤The herbal medicine mentioned by the elders and Zhongcaotang was used for my father's wounds.
推开门便看见门前精神不振的倪旭欣，大抵是一宿未眠才显得如此萎靡。¤When I opened the door, I saw Ni XuXin, who was sluggish in front of the door, who seemed so apathetic after a sleepless night.
才一进屋倪旭欣便瘫在了椅子上，瓮声瓮气地道¤As soon as I entered the room, Ni XuXin collapsed on a chair, the sound of the urn was authentic.
望{FirstName}{xiongdi}海涵，我能说的暂时只有这么多，还请{xiongdi}切莫对外声张。¤I hope {FirstName}{xiongdi} will bear with me, that's all I can say for the time being, please {xiongdi} don't say anything to the public.
我爹目前仍在昏迷中，能救他的大概只有天蝉灵叶了。¤My father is still in a coma, and the only thing that can save him is perhaps the Skyscada Leaf.
据长老们推测，二叔他应该是在寻找戮仙剑的下落。外界盛传此剑在我爹手中，看样子或许是真的......¤According to the elders' speculation, the second uncle should be looking for the whereabouts of theImmortal Executing Sword. It is widely rumored that this sword is in my father's hands. It seems that it may be true...
真不知道从何说起......¤I don't know where to start...
你们大眼瞪小眼地对视了一阵。¤You stared at each other for a while.
奇怪，怎么等了一上午还不见人影？不如我出去找他好了......¤Strange, why didn't you see a person after waiting all morning? Why don't I go out and look for him...
所以在此提醒{FirstName}兄一句，若是前去千万谨慎小心，切莫丢了性命。¤So here is a reminder to {FirstName} brother, if you go there, be very careful and don't lose your life.
中心地区汇集了各派精锐弟子，长老本来安排我前往，但现在我实在没有心思继续探险。¤The central area has gathered elite disciples from various factions. The elder originally arranged for me to go there, but now I really don't have the mind to continue exploring.
没想到外围就这么危险，不仅要提防魔物，还要提防人心险恶。机缘虽好也要有命争夺，我看我还是找个安全点的地方混过剩下的日子算了.....¤Unexpectedly, the periphery is so dangerous. We must not only beware of monsters, but also beware of sinister hearts. Even if the chance is good, we must fight for life. I think I should find a safe place to spend the rest of the day...
他的攻击方式十分独特，不禁让你联想到先前横死的那两位修士尸体上留下的奇怪伤口。¤His attack method is very unique, and you can't help but think of the strange wounds left on the bodies of the two cultivators who died before.
不打了不打了，你们不过是仗着人多罢了，待我回头喊师兄来教训你们。¤Don't fight, don't fight, you are just relying on the number of people. When I turn around, I call senior brother to teach you.
喂，我撑不住了，咱们分头跑！¤Hey, I can't hold it anymore, let's run separately!
丢下这句话，他甩出一串符箓，趁着场面混乱，便化作一道血光遁走了。¤Abandoning this sentence, he threw out a string of talisman, taking advantage of the chaos of the scene, it turned into a bloody light and fled away.
“怎么专挑离火门的弟子下手，难不成是仇家报复？”¤How to specialize in the disciples of the Heavenly Fire Gate, it is difficult to be revenge of the enemy?
别提了，我方才见他一边走一边往怀里揣离火门内门弟子特制的储物袋，正纳闷他一个玄道宗弟子怎么会有我们宗门修士储物袋的时候就被他发现了。¤Don't mention it, I just saw him walking and taking away the special storage bag made by Heavenly Fire Gate Inner Sect disciple in his arms. I was wondering how a Mystic Dao Sect disciple had our Sect cultivator storage bag when he found it. Up.
说他出身魔门只是想{color=#d0380a}诳你帮我{/color}。¤Said that he was born in a magic sect and just wanted to {color=#d0380a} to help me{/color}.
这玄道宗弟子功法稀奇古怪，出手又颇为狠辣。几招过后你便有些难以抵挡。只好借着身法灵活，闪出一个身位后拔腿就跑！¤This Mystic Dao sect disciple has a weird technique, and his shot is quite fierce. After a few moves, you are a little hard to resist. You have to use your posture to be flexible, flash out a posture, and run away!
别提了，我方才见他一边走一边往怀里揣竹山宗内门弟子特制的储物袋，正纳闷他一个玄道宗弟子怎么会有我们宗门修士储物袋的时候就被他发现了。¤Don't mention it, I just saw him walking while holding the special storage bag made by the inner sect disciple of Bamboo Mountain Sect. He found it when he was wondering how a disciple of the Mystic Dao Sect had storage bag for our sect cultivator. .
刚才那修士为何抓着你不放？¤Why did the cultivator hold you just now?
说来也巧，方才遇到的尸体也丢失了储物袋......莫非他弄丢的是那两具尸体身上的储物袋，如此大动干戈是为了销毁证据？¤It's a coincidence that the corpse just encountered also lost the storage bag... Could it be that he lost the storage bag on the two corpses, so he made such a fuss to destroy the evidence?
“怎么专挑竹山宗的弟子下手，难不成是仇家报复？”¤How do you choose the disciples of the Bamboo Mountain Sect, can it be the enemy's revenge?
云汐城东桃李花，飞来飞去落谁家......公孙季想说什么呢？¤The peach and plum blossoms in the east of Yunxi City flew to and flew to whom...What does Gongsun Ji want to say?
你展开纸条，上面只写着一句诗。¤You unfold the note, and there is only a poem written on it.
三派相辅相成才有我星河剑派今日辉煌，长老净是些嘴上不饶人的，实际关系倒也融洽。¤The three factions complement each other to make my Galaxy Sword School glorious today. The elders are not forgiving, and the actual relationship is harmonious.
金虹剑派素来与我派交好，也曾传出不少佳话。¤The Golden Rainbow Sword faction has always had a good relationship with my faction, and there have been many good stories.
嗯，上古时期龙鲲两族强者死伤无数，这尸蛟乃是尸变的龙族强者，嗜血凶蛮，一身龙族死气更是克制我龙族。¤Well, in ancient times, there were numerous deaths and injuries among the Dragon and Kun tribes, and this corpse jiao is a corpse-transformed dragon powerhouse, bloodthirsty and savage, with a dragon death aura that restrains my dragon tribe.
不好，这陨龙之地受力上浮至海面，现在就要沉没了，我们快撤出去。¤No, the land of the falling dragon is forced to rise to the surface of the sea, and it is about to sink now, so let's get out.
{vpunch=10,0.5}轰隆~~¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Boom~~
此番我大意之下被围攻于此，若非道友搭救必殒命于此。¤This time I was carelessly besieged here, if not for your rescue, I would have perished here.
没想到，这只畜生如此难缠。¤Unexpectedly, this beast is so difficult to deal with.
我初入此地，就遭到一元婴期的鲲偷袭，将其斩杀之后更是被四只尸蛟围攻，大意之下让道友见笑了。¤I first entered this place, I was attacked by a Yuanying stage Kun sneak attack, will be killed after it is surrounded by four corpse jiao, carelessness let you laugh.
道友，一身修为如何被围困于此地。¤Daoist, a cultivation how to be trapped in this place.
尸蛟？¤The corpse jiao?
他们围攻我应该也是为了我身上的真龙精血。¤They should also be besieging me for the true dragon blood in my body.
想打就打，想杀就杀，你在天魔眼内可不用顾忌什么情谊，毕竟性命重要。¤Fight if you want, kill if you want, you don't have to worry about friendship in the eyes of the demon, after all, life is important.
大漠里的商路似是有利可图，以钱换命自然...去去去，别耽误我修炼。¤The trade route in the desert seems to be profitable. It is natural to trade money for life...Go and go, don't delay my cultivation.
{xiaozi}你现在声望过低，还是想其他办法进城吧。¤{xiaozi} Your reputation is too low now, so let's find other ways to enter the city.
其实我还有些不情之请，只是这里人多眼杂，您可否移步到小女子的住处，放心酬劳定叫你满意。¤Actually, I also have some ungrateful request, but there are many people here, can you move to the little girl's residence, rest assured that the reward will satisfy you.
道友，你把典籍带来了吗？¤Friends, have you brought the classics?
我还没拿到东西。¤I haven't got anything yet.
对方面露急切。¤The other side showed urgency.
那好吧，还是多谢道友了。¤Okay, I would like to thank fellow daoists.
对方转过身来，神色冷漠的看着你。¤The other party turned around and looked at you coldly.
道友，借你皮囊一用。¤Friends of Taoism, borrow your skin for a use.
你跟着她出了客栈，兜兜转转，来到了一处偏僻的房子。¤You followed her out of the inn, went around and came to a remote house.
{xiaozi}，小心了啊。¤{xiaozi}, be careful.
说罢她祭出一柄血红的仙剑，剑身散发出阵阵血气，向你袭来。¤After that, she sacrificed a blood-red fairy sword, and the sword body exuded bursts of blood and attacked you.
你默默退至人群之后，等候其余修士解决了那魔物后才进入地宫。¤After you retreat silently to the crowd, wait for the other cultivators to solve the monster before entering the underground palace.
你默默退到一边，在这古迹内人人自危，还是先保存实力来的好。¤You silently step aside. Everyone is in danger in this monument. It's better to save your strength first.
此人便是化尘教的{FirstName}长老吧，久闻大名，今日一见果真是修为通天。¤This person is the {FirstName} elder of the Aeonic Sands Temple. I have heard of the name for a long time, and I saw it today.
很快，人群中又走出几人，你认出其中两人是来自离火门的苍坤长老和金虹剑派的明河剑仙。¤Soon, a few people walked out of the crowd, and you recognized that two of them were Elder Pale Earth from the Heavenly Fire Gate and Swordmaster River from the Radiant Sword Sect.
人群中又走出几人，你认出其中两人是来自离火门的苍坤长老和同门的明河剑仙。¤A few more people walked out of the crowd. You recognize that two of them are Elder Pale Earth from the Heavenly Fire Gate and Swordmaster Radiant River from your sect.
挑战守护兽的间隙，一阵阵修士交谈落入你耳中。虽然听不太真切，但不难从只言片语中听出对你的赞叹之意...¤In the gap between challenging the guardian beast, a burst of cultivator conversation fell into your ears. Although it is not very real, it is not difficult to hear the admiration for you from just a few words...
啊啊啊啊！！！¤Ahhhhh!!!
很快，人群中又走出几人，你认出其中两人是来自离火门的苍坤长老和同门的明河剑仙。¤Soon, a few people walked out of the crowd, and you recognized that two of them were Elder Pale Earth from the Heavenly Fire Gate and Swordmaster Radiant River from the same Sect.
你当即朝着发出惨叫声的方向望去，正对上一只沾满鲜血的锐利触肢。¤You immediately looked in the direction of the scream, facing a sharp limb covered with blood.
你们脚下的大地猛地开始震颤起来，伴着令人牙酸的石块摩擦声，一扇通往地下的石门缓缓开启。¤The ground under your feet suddenly began to tremble, and a stone door leading to the ground slowly opened with the scorching sound of stones.
在公孙季的指引下，众人将兽像激活。这些守护兽皆有不弱于元婴期修士的实力，好在数位高手一齐出手，又有阵法大师居中指挥，总算是将五兽一一击破...¤Under the guidance of Gongsunji, everyone activated the image of the beast. These guardian beasts have the strength not weaker than that of the cultivators in the Nascent Soul period. Fortunately, several masters shot together, and there was a master of formation in the middle of the command, and finally one of the five beasts. One blow...
此人便是金虹剑派的{FirstName}长老吧，久闻大名，今日一见果真是修为通天。¤This person is the {FirstName} elder of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect. I have heard of the name for a long time, and I saw it today.
这座被封印许久的地宫果然诡异，幸好方才你没有贸然行事。这魔物周围的修士似乎都陷入了混乱中，看来它的能力不容小觑，你决定...¤This underground palace that has been sealed for a long time is really weird. Fortunately, you didn't act rashly. The cultivators around this monster seem to be in chaos. It seems that its ability should not be underestimated. You decide...
人群中又走出几人，你认出其中两人是来自同门的苍坤长老和金虹剑派的明河剑仙。¤A few more people walked out of the crowd. You recognize that two of them are Elder Pale Earth from your sect and Swordmaster Radiant River from the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect.
古迹中危机重重，机缘往往与危险并存，谨慎的你决定先看看前方那些修士下场如何再行动。¤There are many crises in the historic sites, and chances and dangers often coexist. Be cautious, you decide to see how the cultivators in front of you end up before you act.
此人便是离火门的{FirstName}长老吧，久闻大名，今日一见果真是修为通天。¤This person is the elder {FirstName} of Heavenly Fire Gate. I have heard the name for a long time, and when I see it today, it is really a cultivation base.
此人便是竹山宗的{FirstName}长老吧，久闻大名，今日一见果真是修为通天。¤This person is the {FirstName} elder of Bamboo Mountain Sect. I have heard of the name for a long time, and I saw it today, and I really have a cultivation base.
待门完全打开，一群胆子稍大的修士便蜂拥而出，一时间灵力涌动，一道道光彩争先恐后地窜进门内。毕竟僧多肉少，这门内若是存在什么宝物，定然是先到者得。你决定...¤When the door was fully opened, a group of daring cultivators swarmed out. For a time, spiritual power surged, and brilliance rushed into the door. After all, there are more cultivators and less meat. If there are any treasures in this door, it must be the first to arrive. Whoever gets it. You decide...
这机关兽少说也可媲美元婴初期的修士，能以一人之力连胜五场，实在是了不起。¤These mechanical dolls can be compared to cultivators who are in the early stages of Nascent soul. It is really amazing for one person to be able to win five bouts in a row.
此人便是宁州有名的散修{FirstName}{LastName}吧，久闻大名，今日一见果真是修为通天。¤This person is the famous independent cultivator {FirstName}{LastName} in Ning Province, I have heard about you for a long time, and I see it today that the reputation is well-deserved.
很快，人群中又走出几人，你认出其中两人是来自同门的苍坤长老和金虹剑派的明河剑仙。¤Soon, a few people walked out of the crowd, and you recognized that two of them were Elder Pale Earth from the same sect and Swordmaster Radiant River from the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect.

{vpunch=10,0.5}轰隆隆隆隆隆隆¤{vpunch=10,0.5} rumbling rumbling rumbling rumbling
在你们破阵的过程中，越来越多的人向此地赶来，其中有不少都是各门派中小有名望的长老，你也见到了倪旭欣，百里奇等熟悉的面孔。¤As you broke through, more and more people came to this place, many of them were small and well-known elders of various sects. You also saw Ni XuXin, Bailiqi and other familiar faces.
你一个箭步上前，跃进了门内。只见一片刀光剑影，纷乱的术法与凌厉的煞气混作一团。正当疑惑之时，一股强劲的灵气流袭来，你一时不察，被打了个正着。¤You stepped forward and leaped into the door. You saw a shadow of a sword, a sword, a chaotic spell, and a fierce evil spirit. Just when you were in doubt, a strong spiritual current struck, and you were not noticed for a while, and you were beaten. It's right now.
此人便是星河剑派的{FirstName}长老吧，久闻大名，今日一见果真是修为通天。¤This person is the {FirstName} elder of the Galaxy Sword Sect. I have heard of the name for a long time, and I saw it today.
在公孙季的指引下，你同众人一起将兽像激活。这些守护兽皆有不弱于元婴期修士的实力，好在数位高手一齐出手，又有阵法大师居中指挥，总算是将五兽一一击破...¤Under Gongsunji's guidance, you and everyone will activate the beast statues. These guardian beasts are not weaker than the Nascent Soul-period cultivators. Fortunately, several masters take action together, and there is a formation master in the center. The five beasts defeated one by one...
{FirstName}{xiongdi}别客气了，公孙家可是宁州公认的阵道第一，他说我们厉害那肯定是厉害了。\n¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}Don't be polite, the Gongsun family is the recognized number one in Ning Province for formation dao, he said we are powerful then it must be powerful. \n
你和倪旭欣尽力配合出手，但由于默契太差，他在你之前就击碎了阵法核心，因此没有成功破阵。¤You and Ni XuXin did your best to cooperate, but due to the poor understanding, he smashed the core of the formation before you, so he failed to break the formation.
你和倪旭欣尽力配合出手，但由于默契太差，你在他之前就击碎了阵法核心，因此没有成功破阵。¤You and Ni XuXin did your best to cooperate, but due to the poor understanding, you smashed the core of the formation before him, so you didn't succeed in breaking the formation.
公孙兄谬赞了，我也是在倪兄的提醒下才能猜到破阵方法。¤Brother Gongsun was absurdly praised, and I was only able to guess how to break the formation after Brother Ni's reminder.
你尝试了几次后选择了放弃，正当你和倪旭欣疗伤时，有其他修士配合击碎了人阵眼核心。¤You tried a few times and then chose to give up. Just as you and Ni XuXin were healing, other cultivators cooperated and crushed the core of the human formation.
没想到我倪某人也有成为阵道大师的潜质哈哈哈。¤I didn't expect someone Ni, who has the potential to become a master of formation hahaha.
在你和倪旭欣合力之下，两个核心几乎同时被击破。这一次，核心只是闪耀了几次便碎裂开来。¤Under the combined efforts of you and Ni XuXin, the two cores were destroyed almost at the same time. This time, the cores shattered only after a few times.
你和倪旭欣经过简单商量后，觉得还是交换一下对手比较好。¤After a brief discussion with Ni XuXin, it is better to exchange opponents.
你摇了摇头，先行离开了。公孙季也微笑的跟在后面，只留下倪旭欣还在原地大笑。¤You shook your head and left first. Gongsun Ji followed behind with a smile, leaving only Ni XuXin still laughing.
啊，终于解决了，这个涵虚仙人的阵法真是复杂，可累死我了。¤Ah, it's finally solved. The formation of this Hanxu Immortal is really complicated, but it's exhausting me.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我已经找到窍门了，我们两个必须同时破阵！让我们再试一次。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, I have found the trick, we must both break the formation at the same time! Let's try again.
这两个阵眼相辅相生，涵虚的手段实属高明。只是没想到两位竟能这么快想到破阵之法，换做是在下恐怕也要琢磨许久。¤These two formations complement each other, and the means of Hanxu are really clever. But I didn't expect that the two of them could think of a way to break the formation so quickly, I am afraid it will take a long time to think about it.
终于...一切都结束了...¤Finally... It's all over...
不...我不甘心...¤No... this, this isn't right...
一声巨响后，玄骨化作一团血雾，什么也没有留下...¤After a loud bang, Xuan Bone turned into a cloud of blood and mist, leaving nothing behind...
千年修为，毁于一旦...但这是他自己种下的因，也怪不得旁人。¤Thousands of years of cultivation, ruined... But this is the cause he has planted himself, and there is no one else to blame.
玄骨的眼神中闪过一丝决绝，身体突然剧烈的膨胀起来。¤A hint of determination flashed in Xuan Bone's eyes as his body suddenly swelled up violently.
{size=31}小心，他要自爆了！{/size}¤{size=31}Beware, he's about to blow himself up! {/size}
快退！¤Get back!
此番值守需要2年时间，{shidi}你可准备好了？¤This time on duty will take 2 years, {shidi} are you ready?
玄冥海上如今遍布着这种拘魂阵，我看你们最好还是不要在这里逗留了。¤The Sea of Xuan Yin is now littered with such soul-detaining formations, so I think it is best for you to stay away from here.
我只知道万魂殿长老有一把万魂幡，每过一段时间便会过来收取一次魂魄。其他的便不得而知了。¤I only know that the elders of the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls have a ten-thousand souls streamer, and every once in a while they will come over to collect souls. The rest is not known.
道友有所不知，如今想在阴冥海找到神阴石已经越来越难了。若非为了此物，我们也不至于铤而走险来这玄冥海上探索。¤You don't know that it's getting harder and harder to find the Divine Yin Stone in the Underworld Sea. If it weren't for this object, we wouldn't have taken the risk to explore the Underworld Sea.
解决完万魂殿后，你向被解救出的灵魂体飞去。¤After solving the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls, you fly towards the rescued soul body.
还有一事，你可有听到万魂殿的消息？¤One more thing, have you heard the news of the Hall of Ten Thousand Souls?
若是在此战至领域全开，于你于我皆无好处，不如各退一步。¤If we fight here to the full extent of the realm, neither you nor I will benefit, so let's each take a step back.
吾辈既已触及天道，本只愿静心潜修不想插手世事。但{$shili}有难，也只得出面了。¤Since I have touched the heavenly dao, I would have preferred to meditate and not interfere with world affairs. But {$shili} is in trouble, so I have no choice but to step in.
那又如何？我可不惧你！¤So what? I'm not afraid of you!
在他的示意下，竹山宗掌门识趣地派人带你前往藏经阁。¤At his gesture, the Bamboo Mountain Sect leader has the good sense to send someone to take you to the Hidden Scripture Pavilion.
吾辈既已触及天道，本只愿静心潜修不想插手世事。但道友以大欺小，我也只有出面干预一番了。¤Since I have already touched the Heavenly Dao, I would have preferred to meditate and not interfere in world affairs. But since you are bullying the young, I have no choice but to intervene.
那竹山宗化神修士隐有愠色，但终究还是平复下来。¤That Bamboo Mountain Sect Deity Transformation cultivator was vaguely sulking, but eventually calmed down.
小友能破我护宗大阵，确实有些能耐，老朽我一是惜才，二是不愿插手晚辈之争。¤I'm not willing to interfere with the battle of the younger generation.
原来竹山宗有隐世化神存在，我还当这宗派不过如此呢。¤It turns out that the Bamboo Mountain Sect has the existence of a Hidden Deity Transformation, I thought this sect was nothing more than that.
不如{$称呼}就此离去，之前的战斗也不过是几名不争气的弟子在切磋中被打伤，老朽不再过多追究。¤How about {$call} leaving on this, the previous fight was just a few undisputed disciples being injured in a sparring session, the old man will not pursue it too much.
宗门中神通功法秘籍任由道友拿去，作为交换，你今日不得再伤我竹山宗任何一人。¤In exchange, you shall not harm any of the members of the Bamboo Mountain Sect today.
只是技不如人，不敢开口而已。¤They are just not skilled enough to speak up.
没想到{$shili}还有如此强者，倒还让我长眼了。看前辈这架势，莫不是想出手为这元婴修士报仇？¤I didn't expect {$shili} to have such a strong person, but it made my eyes grow. I don't know if you want to take revenge for this YuanYing cultivator.
你明明...啊！¤You obviously... ah!
你转头向在地上痛苦呻吟的魔修。¤You turned to the evil cultivator who was moaning in pain on the ground.
然后呢？¤Then what?
不，我应该谢谢你，刚才那种情形下若不是有你在一旁震慑他，只怕我已是被炼作那魂幡中的恶鬼了。¤No, I should thank you. If you weren't there to frighten him in the situation just now, I'm afraid that I'd already be refined into an evil spirit in that soul flag.
但看他的神通路数，应该不是我们要找的血剑宫魔修，此事只怕没我们想的简单。¤But looking at his divine skills, it shouldn't be the Blood Sword Palace evil cultivator we were looking for. I'm afraid this matter is not as simple as we thought.
以他们的习惯，遇到冒用血剑宫名头的修士，先诛其人，再灭其门，辱其先祖，断其传承。现在四项俱成，只怕是回雍州复命去了。¤According to their habits, when they encounter a cultivator who pretends to use the name of the Blood Sword Palace, they will first punish their people, then destroy their sects, humiliate their ancestors, and cut off their inheritance. Now that the four items are complete, I am afraid that I will return to Yongzhou to resume my life.
可恶，竟让他跑了。¤Damn, let him run away.
唉，其实是这样的。这青羽门的副门主在其他州假扮血剑宫修士截杀修士赚取灵石、法宝及天材地宝等物事。要知血剑宫这名头是好用，但其中修士也是对这些假借名头的修士厌恶至极。¤Alas, it is so. The deputy head of the Qingyu Gate pretended to be a cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace and intercepted the cultivators in other states to earn spiritual stones, magic weapons, and treasures of heaven and earth. You must know that the title of Blood Sword Palace is easy to use, but the cultivators among them are also extremely disgusted by these cultivators who use their names.
但最近不是急着淬炼我这刚炼成的魂幡么，我又不方便自己出手暴露身份，就...¤But recently, aren't I in a hurry to temper my newly made soul flag, and it's not convenient for me to expose my identity, so...
谢...谢谢，我这就滚。¤Thank you... thank you, I'll leave now.
此番多谢{FirstName}{$NickName}帮忙了，一点小礼不成敬意。¤Thank you {FirstName}{$NickName} for your help this time, a little courtesy is no respect.
我还听说，诛杀冒用血剑宫名头的修士在宫内是会有大量奖励的。¤I also heard that there will be a lot of rewards in the palace for killing cultivators who use the name of the Blood Sword Palace.
那我便先行回门派复命了。¤Then I will go back to the sect first.
好在这一击有些仓促，只让你的神魂如受千针万刺般痛苦，乃至短暂地失去了思考的能力。¤Fortunately, this blow was a bit hasty, and it only caused your soul to suffer like a thousand needles, and even temporarily lost the ability to think.
先不说这些，我们还是审问这魔修一番吧。¤Let's not talk about that, let's interrogate this evil cultivator.
嗯，不过也算是有些收获。我只需将收集到的情报上报门派即可，后续估计要交给风雨楼了。¤Hmm, but it's a bit of a gain. I just need to report the information I have collected to the sect, and it is estimated that it will be handed over to Fengyulou in the future.
咳，我只是把消息告诉血剑宫修士了而已，这...这种拦路截杀的修士，不...不是人人得而诛之么？¤Cough, I just told the news to the cultivators of the Blood Sword Palace. This...this kind of cultivator who intercepts and kills, isn't it...isn't everyone getting it and killing it?
可惜你是个邪修，受死吧！¤It's a pity that you are an evil cultivator, die!
只可惜没能帮上更多的忙。¤Too bad I couldn't be of more help.
{FirstName}{$NickName}的实力真是让在下大开眼界，原只道金丹修士在战斗时打不过还是能跑的，{FirstName}{$NickName}却能生擒金丹修士，只怕击杀他更是轻而易举。¤The strength of {FirstName}{$NickName} is really eye-opening for the next. The original only Dao Jindan cultivator can run away if he can't beat him in battle, but {FirstName}{$NickName} can capture Jindan cultivator alive, only afraid of killing him He is even easier.
对此等魔修确实无需手软。¤There is really no need to be soft on such evil cultivators.
不用客气。\n¤you are welcome. \n
哦？那这拘魂阵怎么说？我可听说是你提前设下的。¤Oh? So what does this soul-stirring array say? I heard you set it up in advance.
抱歉，是我...¤sorry, it's me...
那魔修也深知在{$NpcName}的掩护下，他难以对你补上致命一击，所以也不作试探，而是御起遁术化作一道血光远去。¤That evil cultivator also knows that under the cover of {$NpcName}, it is difficult for him to make up a fatal blow to you, so he does not try to make a test, but turns his escape technique into a bloody light and goes away.
只一招，我就看穿他是在假扮血剑宫修士。将之击败后，觉得此人很是有趣，也就没对他如何。只是每隔一段时间便敲诈他一番。¤With just one move, I saw through him that he was pretending to be a cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace. After defeating him, I thought this person was very interesting, so I didn't do anything to him. Just blackmail him every once in a while.
你知道的还挺多。¤You know quite a lot.
别...我说，我说！¤Don't... I say, I say!
好，你走吧。¤OK, let's go.
{$NpcName}则是守护在你身旁，一时忘了阻止他离开。待你从神魂受到攻击的痛苦中解脱出来时，那魔修早已不知去向。¤{$NpcName} is standing by your side, forgetting to stop him from leaving. By the time you are freed from the pain of being attacked by your soul, the evil cultivator has long since disappeared.
不知是出于顾忌在一旁盯着他的{$NpcId}，还是已然灵气枯竭，这魔修在硬结一记躲不开的攻击神通后，出现了短暂的停顿。¤Whether it was because he was staring at his {$NpcId} out of scruples, or because his spiritual energy was already exhausted, the evil cultivator paused for a while after he fortified an inescapable attack.
这...这...这是我提前知道有人要上门来寻仇，对，就是这样！¤This...this...this is what I knew in advance that someone was coming to seek revenge, yes, that's it!
你一时疏忽之下，竟被这魔修抢中破绽，一记神识攻击直入你头部。¤In a moment of negligence, you were robbed by this evil cultivator, and a divine attack went straight into your head.
饶...饶我一命，我...我什么都说！¤Spare... spare my life, I... I'll say anything!
那得看你表现了。说说是怎么回事吧。¤That depends on your performance. Tell me what happened.
魂幡炼成后就想设法在宁州弄些修士魂魄淬炼一番，但门派之命我又不敢违抗，只能在其他修士仇杀或争斗天材地宝后捡捡漏。¤After the soul flag was perfected, I wanted to try to get some cultivators' souls to temper in Ning Province, but I didn't dare to disobey the order of the sect.
如今确定了事情经过，我的任务也算是完成了，多谢。¤Now that I have determined what happened, my task can be considered complete, thank you.
他不是我的目标，就由{FirstName}{$NickName}定夺吧。¤He's not my target, it's up to {FirstName}{$NickName} to decide.
你是想说这门派的覆灭与你无关？¤Are you trying to say that the demise of this sect has nothing to do with you?
可惜，可惜。¤A pity, a pity.
那血剑宫修士如今去哪了？¤Where is the cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace now?
这副门主又恰巧截杀到我头上。我虽不是同阶血剑宫修士的对手，但也不至于听到名号就闻风而逃。¤This deputy sect master happened to intercept and kill me on the head. Although I am not an opponent of the cultivators of the same level of the Blood Sword Palace, I will not flee when I hear the name.
那...是不是...能放我一条生路？我...我保证这就离开宁州，永不再回。¤So...isn't...can you let me live? I... I promise to leave Ning Province and never return.
就把他卖给血剑宫修士了？¤Just sold him to the cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace?
这魔修一边说着，像是担心你们反悔，还一边把自己的储物袋掏了出来，交到你手上。而后才忍着疼痛御起遁术，化作一道血光迅速远去。¤As the evil cultivator spoke, as if he was worried that you would regret it, he took out his storage bag and handed it to you. Then he endured the pain and used the escape technique, which turned into a bloody light and quickly disappeared.
魔教妖人手段诡异，若不是有{FirstName}{$NickName}陪同，{$ZaiXia}更不是那魔修对手了。¤This cultivator's techniques are strange. If it wasn't for the company of {FirstName}{$NickName}, {$ZaiXia} would not be the evil cultivator opponent.
{$NpcId}过奖了，只是这魔修实力不济而已。¤{$NpcId} has won the prize, but this evil cultivator is not strong enough.
唔...就由{FirstName}{$NickName}拿主意吧。¤Well...let {FirstName}{$NickName} make up your mind.
你虽可恶，但此事确实应该算在那血剑宫修士头上，我倒是可以放你一马。{$NpcId}你怎么看？¤Although you are hateful, this matter should really be counted on the head of the cultivator of the Blood Sword Palace, and I can let you go. What do you think of {$NpcId}?
{$NpcId}见此情形更是早已放松警惕，在一旁为你鼓掌叫好。¤Seeing this, {$NpcId} has already let down his guard and applauded for you.
哼，我看你是想吃点苦头才会说了。¤Hmph, I think you want to suffer a little before saying it.
可...可惜什么？¤But... what a pity?
是...是啊，这门派上下几十位修士可没一个是我杀的。¤Yes... Yes, I killed none of the dozens of cultivators in this sect.
我本是它州修士，奉命来宁州打探情报。但在机缘巧合之下获得了一些炼制魂幡的绝佳材料。¤I was originally a cultivator in other state, and was ordered to come to Ning Province to inquire about information. But by chance, I obtained some excellent materials for refining the soul flag.
{$ZaiXia}便先回门派复命了。¤{$ZaiXia} went back to the sect first.
呼...这秘术还真是不可小觑。¤Whew... This secret art is really not to be underestimated.
琚运琦突破了你们的围攻，化作一道紫黑色的遁光，消失不见了。¤Ju Yunqi broke through your siege and disappeared into a purple-black vanishment of light.
厉害...这秘术还真是不可小觑。¤Amazing... This secret art is really not to be underestimated.
{size=31}白帝楼以后就要交给你们这些小崽子来打理了。尤其是那个倪什么欣的，想想就让老夫头大。{/size}¤{size=31}The White Emperor House will be handed over to you little brats to take care of from now on. Especially that Ni Whatxin one, it makes my head spin just thinking about it. {/size}
现在人已经去了，那白帝楼也只好交给你们这些小崽子来打理了，希望那倪什么欣的不要...¤Now that the man has gone, that White Emperor's House will have to be left to you little brats to take care of, and I hope that that Ni Whatxin's will not...
没想到凌老儿渡劫竟有如此多的劫难，实在是……¤I didn't expect so many calamities for Ling's old man to cross over, it's really ......
{size=31}看到凌老儿能成功飞升，真是替他高兴啊。{/size}¤{size=31}I'm so happy for old Ling to see him succeed in his ascension. {/size}
公孙季正微笑着站在你的禁制前，仿若你的禁制并不存在。他的身后站着各大势力的金丹修士，看来都是为了涵虚仙府而来的。只不过有些修士衣衫稍有不整，显然是之前在战斗中吃了点亏。¤Gongsun Ji is standing in front of your ban with a smile, as if your ban doesn't exist. Behind him stands the golden core cultivators of various powers, who seem to have come to contain the Xuxian Mansion. There are just a few. The cultivator's clothes are slightly untidy, obviously because he suffered a bit in the battle before.
若是这次出了什么意外，我确实没有把握保护他的周全。¤If anything were to happen this time, I really wouldn't be sure of protecting his well-being.
师兄其实是因为担心倪兄，所以才不让他去的吧？¤Brother actually kept him away because he was worried about Brother Ni, right?
离开武陵城后，你二人向着西方飞去。¤After leaving Wuling City, the two of you fly towards the west.
新学了那么多招式，正好先拿这工具人练练手。¤I learned so many new tricks, so I just used this tool to practice my hand first.
此地是一个{$Var1}的洞窟，看来盘踞这里的兽王八成是{$Var2}。¤This place is a cave of {$Var1}. It seems that the Beastmaster who occupies here is {$Var2}.
吼！！！！¤Roar!!!!
哼，受死！¤Huh, die!
这沂山双鬼平日里纵容手下四处杀人夺宝，可算是宁州的一大祸害，如今除了他们二人也算是功德一件。¤These two ghosts of Yishan usually indulge their subordinates to kill people and obtain treasures. It can be regarded as a great disaster in Ning Province. Nowadays, the two of them are also regarded as a piece of merit.
风力的变化应该是有规律的，你猜测，下一次风力减弱的时间应当是...？¤The wind changes should be regular. You guessed that the next time the wind weakens should be...?
看来这里曾经是这位前辈的清修之地，你决定...？¤It seems that this place used to be a place for this predecessor to cultivate, you decide...?
既然我受了前辈传承，也应当算前辈的半个弟子了吧。¤Since I have inherited the inheritance of seniors, I should be regarded as half of seniors' disciples.
你后退几步，找了个地方盘腿坐下，一边观察，一边等待起来。¤You take a few steps back, find a place to sit cross-legged, and watch as you wait.
你一口气冲过裂缝，发现自己已经来到了一个地下溶洞之中。身后隐约还能听到呼啸的风声，而洞窟中却安静的很，不到百米的距离却仿佛进入了另外一个世界。¤You rushed through the cracks in one breath and found that you had come into an underground cave. The whistling wind could be heard faintly behind you, but the cave was quiet, less than a hundred meters away, but it seemed that you had entered another world. .
这地下溶洞本来应该是一片漆黑，但远处却隐隐能够看到一丝亮光。¤This underground cave should have been pitch black, but a faint light can be seen in the distance.
第一本《凝水归流》乃水系法门，自身灵力越强，效果越好，当年帮本座度过了不少难关。¤The first book Condensed Shui Guiliu is a method of water system. The stronger the spiritual power, the better the effect. It helped me through many difficulties that year.
你全力施展遁术，但距离风口只有几步远时，一股恐怖的劲风又从裂缝中吹来。此时的风力已胜外围百倍。¤You used your full force of escape, but when you were only a few steps away from the tuyere, a terrifying wind blew from the crack again. At this time, the wind was a hundred times stronger than the outside.
本座能够修行近千载，靠的也是当年游历时偶然得到的那几本秘术。如今既已身死，倒也不希望它们就此埋没。¤This seat has been able to practice for nearly a thousand years, relying on the few secret arts that I accidentally obtained during the travels that year. Now that I am dead, I don't want them to be buried.
你终究还是慢了一些，被吹出好远的距离，重重地砸在岩壁之上，晕死过去...¤After all, you are still slower, blown a long distance, slammed heavily on the rock wall, and fainted...
这两片玉简应当就是前辈提及的两本秘术，那几本书册或许是前辈记录的一些心得体会，就这样毁了真是可惜...¤These two pieces of jade slips should be the two secrets mentioned by the predecessor. Those few books may be some of the experience recorded by the predecessors. It is a pity that they are destroyed in this way...
你平日里也算修行过一些炼体法门，又顶着巨风走了数百米后，风势渐涨，竟也开始感到力不从心，只能勉强用灵力护住周身不被罡风刮伤，却是难以继续前进了。¤You have practiced some physical training methods on weekdays, and after walking hundreds of meters against the huge wind, the wind gradually rose, and you started to feel powerless. You could only barely use your spiritual power to protect your body from being scratched by the wind. , But it is difficult to move on.
你平日里不曾炼体，尽管已有金丹修为，但此时竟也感到有些力不从心，只能勉强用灵力护住周身不被罡风刮伤，确是难以继续前进了。¤You have never practiced your body on weekdays. Even though you have a golden core cultivation base, you still feel a little powerless at this time. You can only barely use your spiritual power to protect your body from being scratched by the wind. It is indeed difficult to move on.
循着亮光走去，原来是一枚夜明珠被摆放在一张石桌之上，再向旁边望去，还有一张石床，上面是一具盘膝而坐的骷髅。¤Following the bright light, it turned out that a night pearl was placed on a stone table, and then looking to the side, there was also a stone bed with a skeleton sitting cross-legged.
妙哉妙哉，如此奇地，若非有人刻意布阵所为，就是大自然的鬼斧神工，无论如何都值得一看。¤Wonderful, wonderful, so strange, if it weren't for someone deliberately arranging an array, it would be the magical work of nature, it is worth seeing anyway.
另外的那本《逆周天结婴术》乃结婴所用秘术，能够提高结婴的成功率。若你已是元婴修为自然无用，但若还在金丹，想必会对你有所帮助。¤The other book, Ning Zhou Tian Ning Shu is the secret technique used in the nascent soul formation, which can increase the success rate of the breaking through. It is naturally useless if you have a Nascent Soul cultivation base, but if you are still in the golden core, it will definitely be against you. It helps.
一阵猛烈的狂风从不远处的峡谷刮来，未曾防备之下竟将你吹得一个踉跄，皮肤也被刮的生疼。¤A violent gust of wind blows from a gorge not far away, unpreparedly, it staggers you, and your skin hurts.
你惊讶地向峡谷望去，只见峡谷两侧的山石全部都被这里的狂风刮得如同刀削一般平整，没有一棵草木生长。¤You look at the gorge in surprise, and you see that the rocks on both sides of the gorge are all flattened by the wind here, and no vegetation grows.
你全力施展遁术，短短三息之间便来到了风口的深处，巨风便是从这里的一个裂缝中吹出。¤You used your full force of escape, and in just three breaths, you came to the depths of the tuyere, and the huge wind blew out from a crack here.
哎，这位前辈能在这种奇地搭建洞府修炼，想来当年也是一方大能，但到最后也逃不过这身死道消的命运...¤Hey, this predecessor was able to build a cave in such a strange place. He was also a great power in the past, but in the end he could not escape the fate of death...
你在这小小的洞府中仔细搜索了一番，可惜除了几本已经无法阅读的书册外，一无所获。¤You searched this little cave house carefully, but unfortunately, you found nothing except a few books that you can't read anymore.
到了第五日的酉时，风口的风力陡然减小。你等了整整五日，等待的就是这个机会，立刻运足灵力，毫不犹豫地冲了出去。¤At the time of the fifth day, the wind at the tuyere suddenly decreased. You waited for five days, waiting for this opportunity, immediately used your spiritual power, and rushed out without hesitation.
等到第二日{color=#d0380a}子{/color}时，风力突然有所减弱，但只持续了短短几息时间便又恢复如常。¤Waiting for the next day {color=#d0380a}{/color}, the wind suddenly weakened, but it only lasted a few breaths before returning to normal.
暗格中只有两片碧绿的玉简，和几本颜色发黄，已经四分五裂的书册。随着暗阁的震动，书册竟碎成了一堆粉末。¤There are only two green jade slips in the secret grid, and a few yellow-colored books that have been torn apart. With the shaking of the dark pavilion, the books shattered into a pile of powder.
你心有不甘的想要看看石床下还有没有别的暗格，谁知刚一用力，便不知启动了什么机关，整个石床“砰”的一下炸成了粉末。¤You are unwilling to see if there are any other hidden compartments under the stone bed. Who knows that as soon as you use your force, you don't know what mechanism is activated, and the entire stone bed bangs and explodes into powder.
本座乃通古门长老鸿凌子，若有人能看到这里，证明本座修真之路已断，最终也未能突破到化神期。¤This seat is Tonggumen elder Hong Lingzi. If anyone can see here, it proves that the road to cultivation of this seat is broken, and ultimately it has not been able to break through to the Deity Transformation stage.
洞府已毁，你懊恼不已，但也只能愤愤地离开了这里。¤The cave is destroyed, you are very upset, but you can only leave here angrily.
你于炼体一道颇有所成，强顶着罡风又走了半日，这才走到风口的深处，巨风便是从这里的一个裂缝中吹出，而这里的风力已胜外围百倍。¤You are quite successful in refining the body, and you walked for a long time against the strong wind, and then you reached the depths of the tuyere. The huge wind blows out from a crack here, and the wind here is a hundred times stronger than the outside. .
在修真这条大道上，身份贵贱，男女之别，年龄大小，皆是虚妄，而若是不能最终跨过仙凡那道鸿沟，那现在所经历的一些都不过是镜花雪月，毫无意义。¤On the avenue of cultivation, the status, the difference between men and women, and age are all vain, and if you can’t finally cross the gap between Xianfan and Fan, then what you have experienced now is nothing but a mirrored flower and snowy moon. significance.
你走到床边，对着这具骷髅恭敬地行了一礼。¤You walked to the bed and saluted this skeleton respectfully.
不知是不是你的动作太大，那句骷髅发出一声轻微的咔嚓声，倒落碎成了一堆。¤I don't know if your movement is too big, the skeleton made a slight click, and it fell into a pile.
你顶着罡风慢慢向峡谷深处走去，没走多远就感觉风阻越来越大，已是谷口处的数倍。¤You walked slowly toward the depths of the canyon against the wind, and you felt that the wind resistance was getting bigger and bigger before you walked far, which is several times that of Taniguchi.
正当你唏嘘不已时，恍惚见看到一道淡淡的反光闪过，竟是一枚玉简。¤Just as you were sighing, you saw a faint reflection flashing past, it turned out to be a jade slip.
你走到床头，果然看到一枚石球。随着你将灵气注入，石床之下的暗格缓缓打开。¤You walked to the head of the bed, and you saw a stone ball. As you poured aura into it, the dark compartment under the stone bed slowly opened.
到第三日的{color=#d0380a}卯{/color}时，和第四日的{color=#d0380a}午{/color}时，风力同样会有一瞬间的减弱。若能精确把握这个时间，提前做好准备，也许就能成功冲入风口。¤At {color=#d0380a}Mao{/color} on the third day, and {color=#d0380a} noon{/color} on the fourth day, the wind will also decrease for a moment. If you can accurately grasp this Time, if you prepare well in advance, you may be able to successfully rush into the air.
到了第五日时，你毫不犹豫地冲了出去。可是风力并没有像你预想的那样减弱。你被烈风吹出好远的距离，重重地砸在岩壁之上，晕死过去...¤On the fifth day, you rushed out without hesitation. But the wind did not weaken as you expected. You were blown a long distance by the gale, hit hard on the rock wall, and passed out.. .
你在鸿凌子的墓前磕了几个响头，然后便转身离开了这里。¤You knocked your head a few times in front of Hong Lingzi's tomb, then turned and left here.
你这样想着，于是在洞窟中凿除了一个小小的墓穴，又简单的立了一个墓碑，将鸿凌子的尸首安葬了进去。¤Thinking about this, you cut out a small tomb in the cave, and simply set up a tombstone and buried Hong Lingzi's body in it.
这个石床之下另有一层机关，你只需将灵力输入床头的那枚石球便能打开，切勿使用蛮力。¤There is another layer of mechanism under this stone bed. You only need to input spiritual power into the stone ball at the head of the bed to open it. Don't use brute force.
这枚玉简刚刚正被这具骷髅握在手中，因此不曾被你看到。如今骷髅碎成了一堆，反倒是让这枚玉简漏了出来。¤This jade slip was just being held by this skeleton, so it was never seen by you. Now the skeleton is broken into a pile, but this jade slip was leaked out.
这座峡谷似乎并不简单，要冒险前往探索一番么？¤This canyon doesn't seem to be simple, do you want to venture out and explore it?
晚辈多有打扰，还请前辈见谅。¤The younger generations are bothering me. Please forgive me, seniors.
你平日里虽也修行过一些炼体法门，但不甚精通。又走不到百米，风势渐涨，你也开始感到力不从心，只能勉强用灵力护住周身不被罡风刮伤，确是难以继续前进了。¤Although you have practiced some body refining methods on weekdays, you are not very proficient. You are less than a hundred meters away, and the wind is rising, and you start to feel powerless. You can only barely use your spiritual power to protect your body from being scratched by the wind. , It is really difficult to move on.
你一口气冲过裂缝，发现自己已经来到了一个地下溶洞之中。身后还能听到呼啸的风声，而洞窟中却平静的很，不到百米的距离却仿佛进入了另外一个世界。¤You rushed through the cracks in one breath and found that you have come into an underground cave. You can hear the whistling wind behind you, but the cave is quiet, less than a hundred meters away, as if you have entered another world.
通古门的名号我之前从未听说过，也不知鸿凌子前辈已经离世多少年了，书纸都腐败成了这样。¤I've never heard of the name of Tonggumen before, and I don't know how many years have passed since Honglingzi's predecessor, and the books and papers are corrupted like this.
找了个清净的角落，调整一下状态。¤Find a clean corner, adjust the state.
{FirstName}{shidi}，你是第二次参加宗门大比了吧？希望你这次可以有所斩获。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, is it your second time to participate in the Sect Grand Competition? I hope you can gain something this time.
赛制使用两两对决的淘汰赛。师弟，请在候场区等候，要登台时自会有人通知。¤The competition system uses a two-by-two knockout match. Junior brother, please wait in the waiting area, and someone will inform you when you want to go on stage.
道友，正值我竹山宗宗门大比之际，请回吧。¤Friends of Taoism, please come back at the time of my Bamboo Mountain sect competition.
（还有一段时间才能轮到我上台，现在做什么好呢...？）¤(It's still a while before it's my turn to take the stage. What should I do now...?)
（希望我竹山宗能涌现一些好苗子，能够一改猎魔试炼的颓势。）¤(I hope that some good seedlings can emerge from the Bamboo Mountain Sect, which can change the decline of the demon hunting trial.)
我竹山宗每30年一次宗门大比，希望各位你们拿出实力，扬我门威。¤My Bamboo Mountain sect has a sect competition every 30 years. I hope you all can show your strength and raise my prestige.
{FirstName}\r{LastName}对阵端木林！¤{FirstName}\r{LastName} vs. Duanmulin!
谢师兄挂念，只能说是尽力而为了。¤Senior Brother Xie missed him, and he could only say that he did his best.
{FirstName}{shidi}，大比的赛制使用两两对决的淘汰赛。你先找个地方调整一下，要登台时自会有人通知。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, the competition system of the Big Competition uses a two-by-two matchup. You will find a place to adjust it, and someone will notify you when you want to go on stage.
{FirstName}{shidi}，希望你这次可以有所斩获。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, I hope you can gain something this time.
{shidi}，是来参加门派大比的吗？¤{shidi}, are you here to participate in the martial arts competition?
哈哈，师弟不要妄自菲薄，仙途漫漫，资质从不是最重要的，由擂台而进入宗门的你更应是深有体会。¤Haha, Junior Brother, don't pretend to be self-defeating. The journey of immortality is long. Qualification is never the most important. You should have a deep understanding of entering the sect from the ring.
{shidi}，本次大比准备的怎么样啊？¤{shidi}, how did you prepare for this competition?
{FirstName}{shidi}，你是第三次参加宗门大比了吧？希望你这次可以有所斩获。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, this is the third time you have participated in the Zongmen Competition? I hope you can gain something this time.
师兄，我去了。¤Brother, I'm going.
围墙乃是父亲为躲避龙族攻击所建，如今龙珠已物归原主，这围墙大概也派不上什么用场了。¤The wall was built by my father to avoid the attack of the dragon clan. Now that the dragon ball has returned to the original owner, this wall probably won't be of much use.
何况还有传说中位于海洋深处的十万年凶兽，那可是元婴期修士也不敢招惹的。¤What's more, there is the legendary 100,000-year-old fierce beast located in the depths of the ocean. That is something that the cultivators of the Nascent Soul stage dare not provoke.
百里邑神色坚定，眼中精光闪烁，看来是没办法从他口中打听到百里奇的去向了。¤Baliyi's expression is firm, and his eyes are shining. It seems that there is no way to know the whereabouts of Bailiqi from his mouth.
围墙乃是为保护广陵城百姓所筑，保险起见分为内外二城，万一外城防线溃败可退至内城。¤The wall was built to protect the people of Guangling City. It is divided into two cities, inside and outside, for insurance purposes. In case the defense line of the outer city is defeated, you can retreat to the inner city.
犬子前些日子去了族中秘境历练，恐怕无法与小友共同出海了。¤Inuzi went to the clan secret realm a few days ago to experience, I am afraid I can't go out to sea with my little friends.
数千年修为的海兽，往往就能与人类的金丹期修士相匹敌。¤A sea beast that has been cultivated for thousands of years can often match the golden core cultivators of mankind.
呵呵，犬子离家前曾告诉我若{FirstName}道友前来便将他历练之事告诉你。¤Hehe, before leaving home, Inuzi told me that if fellow {FirstName} Daoist came, he would tell you about his experience.
无尽之海中的妖兽，要比宁州往日里常见的妖兽恐怖的多。¤The monster beast in the endless sea is far more terrifying than the monster beast common in Ning Province in the past.
百里家主竟知百里兄打算与在下出海吗？¤Does the Patriarch Baili know that Brother Baili plans to go to sea with Zai?
百里世家这数百年来一直受龙族制约，现在矛盾既已解决，族人也可前往更深的海域了。¤The Baili family has been restricted by the dragon clan for hundreds of years. Now that the contradiction has been resolved, the clan can go to deeper waters.
百里世家这数百年来的使命便是抵御海兽的攻击，围墙也是因此而建立的。¤The mission of the Baili Family for hundreds of years is to resist the attacks of sea beasts, and the wall was built for this reason.
提及围墙时百里邑神色明显僵硬了几分，仿佛不愿与你多说。你虽心中存疑，见此也不好继续追问。¤When talking about the wall, Bailiyi's expression became visibly stiff, as if he didn't want to tell you more. Although you have doubts in your heart, it is not good to continue to ask questions.
当然，海兽数量众多，我府人丁也有限，有时也会不得已向散修及宗门修\r士求援。¤Of course, there are a large number of sea beasts, and our mansion is also limited, and sometimes I have to ask independent cultivators and sect deciples for help.
小友想问何事？¤What does the little friend want to ask?
一道冰冷的神识从你识海中扫过，你只觉得自己仿佛被一条隐匿于黑暗中的毒蛇牢牢盯住。¤A cold soul sense swept across the sea of ​​your knowledge, and you only felt as if you were being stared at by a poisonous snake hiding in the dark.
还未等你反应过来，身后杀气已至！¤I haven't waited for you to react, the murderous intent behind me has arrived!
若没有控制这种火焰独特的方法，即便由你出手帮助，至多不过保他不受反噬，但也绝不可能操控这团火焰。¤Without a unique method of controlling this flame, even if you were to help, you would at best be able to protect him from the backlash, but you would never be able to control this flame.
轰！¤Boom!
{$daoyou}，修炼神通还是应当徐徐图之，最忌急躁。以你现在的状态，还是不要继续修炼了。¤{$daoyou}, cultivating divine abilities should be done slowly and should not be rushed. You should not continue cultivating in your current state.
只听轰的一声巨响，随着火焰炸开，灵气剧烈的波动起来。好在在你的压制之下，至少保护了{$jiaofei}没有因此而受到重伤。¤Only a loud boom was heard, and as the flames exploded, the aura fluctuated violently. Luckily, with your suppression, you at least protected {$jiaofei} from being seriously injured as a result.
不错，我努力修炼从不是为了什么得道长生，而是为了复仇。¤It is true that I have never worked hard to cultivate for the sake of attaining immortality, but for revenge.
是焦兄...但这神通是？¤It's Brother Jiao... But this Avatar is?
若你不能放下这一心结，突破时很有可能就会因为意志溃散而神魂俱灭。¤If you cannot let go of this knot, there is a good chance that your soul will be destroyed when you break through because your will will collapses.
是焦长老？但他练的似乎不像本门神通...¤Is it Elder Jiao? But he doesn't seem to be practicing the same divine power as our school...
你顺着声音传来的方向走去，但见一红袍修士盘腿席地而坐，全身沐浴于一团金色的火焰之中，似乎正在修炼某种高深的法门。¤You follow the direction from which the voice came, but you see a red-robed cultivator sitting cross-legged on the ground, his whole body bathed in a golden flame, as if he is practising some profound technique.
你敏锐地捕捉到了这一机会，立刻驱使法宝向他冲了过去。¤You keenly catch the opportunity and immediately drive your magic treasure towards him.
{$jiaofei}对于这种情况似乎并不感到意外，亦或是过去修炼时他已经很多次经历过这样受伤的情景。¤{$jiaofei} did not seem surprised by this situation, or perhaps he had experienced such injuries many times in his past practice.
抱歉，我不能告诉你。¤Sorry, I can't tell you.
一阵剧烈的灵气波动传来，伴随着令人不适的热浪扑面而来，即便在这里也并不常见。¤A violent ripple of aura comes through, accompanied by an uncomfortable heat wave that is not common even here.
原来如此...看来这便是困扰你的心结了。¤So that's it... It seems that this is the knot that is bothering you.
我听说，突破元婴时须得经历心魔考验。¤I have heard that one has to go through a test of heart demons when breaking through to the firstborn.
{$jiaofei}一拳砸在地上，眼神中充满着不甘与...仇恨？¤{$jiaofei} slammed his fist on the ground, his eyes filled with resentment and... Hate?
你将一枚少阴清灵丹向他掷去，{$jiaofei}吞下丹药后，气息渐稳，慢慢地压制着那团金色的火焰缩小直到消散。¤You toss a Shao Yin Qing Ling Dan towards him, {$jiaofei} swallowing it, his breath gradually stabilizing, slowly suppressing the golden flame as it shrinks until it dissipates.
他表情平静，看起来心境平和，你看不出有何异样之处。¤His expression is calm and he seems to be in a peaceful state of mind, you can't tell anything is different.
他虽然表情平静，外表看似心境平和，但运气修炼时却略显急躁，以至于对灵气与火焰的掌控能力也有所下降。¤Although he has a calm expression and appears to be in a peaceful state of mind, he is slightly impatient when he cultivates with his luck, so much so that his control over his aura and flame has diminished.
还是说，{$daoyou}有什么难言之隐？¤Or is there something hard to say about {$daoyou}?
但是，问题可能是出在了何处呢...？¤But where might the problem lie...?
正当你暗自思付时，只听{$jiaofei}闷哼一声，刚刚凝聚出的金色火焰仿佛是要挣脱出他的束缚一般，又开始剧烈地抖动起来。¤Just as you are secretly thinking about paying for it, you only hear {$jiaofei} muffled, and the golden flames that had just coalesced as if they were trying to break free from his bonds begin to shake violently again.
总之，他很快便又闭上双目，重新开始调息打坐。一团小小的金色火焰凭空出现，悬浮于他的胸前。¤Anyway, he soon closed his eyes again and began to meditate again. A small golden flame appeared out of thin air and hovered in front of his chest.
我会好好考虑的。¤I will give it some thought.
若是你愿意的话，不妨把困扰你的事情说出来，或许我能够帮助你解开这个心结。¤If you are willing, you may wish to tell me what is troubling you and perhaps I can help you untie this knot.
不好，他内伤未愈，看来又要控制不住了！¤No good, he hasn't recovered from his internal injuries and it looks like he's losing control again!
我所修炼的神通，唤作凤灵妖火，是我们焦家代代相传一门秘法。¤The divine ability I cultivate is called Phoenix Spirit Demon Fire, a secret technique passed down from generation to generation in our Jiao family.
{$daoyou}可知，突破元婴时须得经历心魔考验。¤{$daoyou} can tell that when breaking through to the firstborn, one has to go through a test of heart demons.
等到大仇得报的那一天，心魔自然也会消除。¤When the day comes when the great revenge is avenged, the demons of the heart will naturally be removed.
何况这天下流传的结婴秘术千奇百怪，或许有某种秘术能够帮助你压制心魔也未可知。¤Besides, there are so many different secret techniques of infant formation circulating in the world that it is possible that there is some secret technique that can help you suppress your demons.
若要控制住这种特殊的火焰，必定离不开对火道与气道极其高深的感悟。{$daoyou}如果能在大道感悟上更加精进一步，再回来领悟神通定会事半功倍的。¤If you want to control this particular flame, you have to have an extremely deep understanding of the fire and qi dao. {If you can further refine your understanding of the Dao, then you will be able to come back and understand the divine ability with half the effort.
以你对火道的感悟，想要控制寻常火焰定然不费吹灰之力。但这金色火焰竟像是产生了自我意识一样，拼命想要挣脱你的控制。¤With your perception of the fire dao, it would be effortless to control an ordinary flame. But this golden flame seems to have developed self-awareness, desperately trying to break free from your control.
这团金色的火焰似乎极不稳定，很快便剧烈的抖动起来。¤This golden flame seemed extremely unstable and soon trembled violently.
他刚刚修炼时受到的灵气波动虽大，但以他金丹期的修为，并不至于因此便内脏受损口吐鲜血。¤Although the aura fluctuations he had just received during his training were great, with his Jindan stage cultivation, he was not so damaged that he spat blood from his internal organs.
结婴时虽说有心魔考验，但若意志坚定，也未必没有成功的可能。¤Although there is a test of heart demons at the time of infant formation, it may not be impossible to succeed if one is strong-willed.
你隐约觉得，他就算这样继续强行修炼下去，也并没有成功的可能。¤You have a vague feeling that he doesn't have a chance of success even if he continues to force himself to cultivate like this.
索性{$jiaofei}似乎掌握了某种能够指挥这种火焰的秘术，在你的帮助下，他重新压制住火焰，控制着它慢慢缩小，直到消散。¤Solely {$jiaofei} seems to have mastered some kind of secret art capable of commanding this flame, and with your help he re-suppresses it, controlling it as it slowly shrinks until it dissipates.
若你能突破元婴，到时再修炼这异火秘术自然是水到渠成，报仇也更有把握了。¤If you can break through to the firstborn, then you will naturally be able to cultivate this secret art of foreign fire, and you will be more certain of revenge.
若你能放下心结，专注于感悟大道提升修为，未来大有突破至元婴期的可能。¤If you can let go of the knot in your heart and focus on perceiving the Great Dao to improve your cultivation, you have a great chance of breaking through to the YuanYing stage in the future.
看来{$daoyou}是有什么心结吧？若被这种执念影响了心境，日后修为就再难精进了。¤It seems {$daoyou} has some kind of knot in his heart, right? If you let this kind of obsession affect your mind, it will be difficult to refine your cultivation in the future.
难道...这是传说中的某种异火？¤Could it be... Is this some kind of legendary fire?
即便你真能练成这凤灵妖火，想以金丹修为击败元婴期的对手，又有几分把握？¤Even if you can really practice this Phoenix Spirit Demon Flame, how sure are you that you can defeat a YuanYing stage opponent with your Jindan cultivation?
砰！¤Bang!
当年我尚年幼，虽不清楚这些人的具体身份，却记下了他们的神通招式。¤When I was young, I was not sure of the identities of these men, but I did write down their magic moves.
这是心结，但也是支撑我修炼的动力。若真放下了，我又为何而修炼呢...¤It is a knot in my heart, but it is also what sustains me in my cultivation. If I really let go of it, why am I practising...
过了这么久...如今这凤灵妖火之名即便在中州恐怕也很少会有人提起了，你自然没听说过。¤After such a long time... Nowadays, I am afraid that the name of this Phoenix Spirit Demon Flame will rarely be mentioned even in the Central Region, so naturally you have not heard of it.
他刚刚在修炼时孕育的那种金色灵焰绝不是寻常火焰，即便以你对于火道的感悟已然大成，也绝无可能凭空创造出这样的一团火焰。¤The golden spirit flame that he just nurtured during his cultivation is by no means an ordinary flame. Even if your perception of the Dao of Fire has already reached great success, there is no way you could create such a flame out of thin air.
你运足灵气，向那团金色地火焰罩去。¤You use all your aura and move towards the golden flame.
告辞...¤Farewell...
到时再修炼这异火秘术，自然水到渠成，重振家族也大有希望，岂不比现在白白送命要好的多。¤When the time comes to cultivate this secret art of foreign fire, the water will naturally come to fruition and there will be great hope to revive the family, wouldn't it be better than to die for nothing now?
不管你做了什么决定，记得告诉我。¤Whatever decision you make, remember to let me know.
我出生没多久，家族唯一的元婴老祖意外陨落。失去了元婴强者的庇护，我们很快就被觊觎异火秘术的魔修盯上了。¤Not long after I was born, the family's only YuanYing ancestor unexpectedly fell. Having lost the shelter of the strongest YuanYing ancestor, we were soon targeted by evil cultivators who coveted the secret art of foreign fire.
凤灵妖火...难道是某种传说中的异火么？我竟从来没有听说过...¤The Phoenix Spirit Demon Flame... Is it some kind of legendary fire? I've never heard of it before...
可以确定，那时领头之人所使的，便是幽州天魔道的神通。¤It is certain that what the leader was using at that time was the divine power of the Heavenly Demon Dao of the You State.
此事与你无关...¤This is none of your business...
我虽不知{$daoyou}你在修炼的是什么神通，但即便你继续像现在这样强行修炼下去，也只是徒劳让自己受伤罢了。¤Although I don't know {$daoyou} what divine ability you are cultivating, even if you continue to forcefully cultivate as you are doing now, you will only be making yourself injured in vain.
不管怎么说，谢谢你的建议。¤Anyway, thanks for the advice.
我有不得不做之事，即便最后因此殒命我也不会后悔。¤I had to do what I had to do, and I will not regret it even if I end up dying for it.
数个元婴期高手联手，我们自然不是对手。家族同胞尽数陨落，只有我侥幸活了下来，辗转逃到了宁州。¤Several YuanYing stage experts joined forces, so naturally we were no match. I was the only one who managed to survive and fled to Ning Province.
伴随着一阵剧烈的灵气波动，火焰散去，只见{$jiaofei}眉头紧锁，嘴角留下一缕鲜血，似乎受了不小的内伤。¤With a violent fluctuation of aura, the flames dissipated, only to see {$jiaofei}'s brow locked and a wisp of blood left at the corner of his mouth, as if he had suffered a considerable internal injury.
他刚刚在修炼时孕育的那种金色灵焰你闻所未闻，你于火之道的感悟本就不算精通，实在很难从这里得到什么有用的信息。¤You've never heard of the golden flame he just birthed during his training, and your sense of the Way of Fire is not really proficient, so it's hard to get any useful information from here.
若你真的无法放下这心结，倒不如放手一搏吧。¤If you really can't let go of this knot, you might as well give it a go.
若是气道修为高深，或许可以强行控制住灵力波动，或是至少保护内脏与经脉不受此冲击而受伤。可惜你对气道亦不精通，换做是你也未必能做的更好。¤If you are proficient in Qi Dao, you may be able to forcefully control the fluctuation of spiritual energy, or at least protect your internal organs and meridians from being injured by this impact. Unfortunately, you are not proficient in the qi dao either, and you may not be able to do a better job if you were in your shoes.
我并非宁州生人，而是自中州而来。¤I am not a native of Ning Province, but have come from the Middle Kingdom.
{$jiaofei}强行修炼神通受了内伤，此时正是你趁火打劫的大好时机。¤{$jiaofei} has suffered internal injuries from forcibly cultivating divine powers, and this is a great time for you to take advantage of the fire.
{$daoyou}，你心境不稳，服下此丹，或许能帮你控制这灵焰。¤{$daoyou}, your mind is unstable, take this pill, it may help you control this spirit flame.
好诡异的神通...这是？¤What a bizarre power... This is?
此事与你并无关系，你不想无端牵扯进来。¤This matter does not concern you and you do not want to get involved for no reason.
你运足灵气，向那团金色的火焰罩去。¤You transport your aura to the golden flame.
若不能亲自手刃这些人，即便百年以后他们未能突破化神而殒命了，也难解我心头之恨！¤If I cannot personally kill these people, even if they fail to break through the Deity Transformation and die a hundred years later, it will still be hard for me to resolve the hatred in my heart!
如果你没有其它事的话，我要重新开始修炼了。¤If you have nothing else to do, I'm going to restart my practice.
这些年来我接了不少剿灭邪修的任务，暗中调查当年之事，最近终于有所进展。¤Over the years I have taken on a number of missions to eliminate evil cultivators and secretly investigate the events of that year, and I have finally made some progress recently.
你虽有心相助，却束手无策。只能眼睁睁看着火焰“轰”的一声炸开，{$jiaofei}口吐鲜血，大口大口的喘着粗气。¤You can't do anything about it, even though you want to help. You can only watch as the flames explode with a loud bang, {$jiaofei} spitting out blood and gasping for air.
若是能在修炼时服下一颗{color=#d0380a}少阴清灵丹{/color}，应该有助于他稳定心境，至少不至于受到这灵焰的反噬。¤If he could take a {color=#d0380a}Shao Yin Clear Spirit Pill{/color} while cultivating, it should help him stabilize his mind, or at least not suffer from the backlash of this spirit flame.
这的确难以两全...¤It is indeed difficult to have it both ways...
看来他修炼的这门神通对五脏六腑产生的压力颇大，若还要强行修炼的话，恐怕会有性命之忧...¤It seems that the divine power he is practising is putting a lot of pressure on his internal organs, and if he still has to force himself to practise it, he is afraid that his life will be in danger...
看来，是长时间强行修炼已经对他的内脏与经脉造成了过重的压力。但若能在{color=#d0380a}气道{/color}感悟上更进一步，达到道之真境的境界，便能保护自身不受灵气波动的冲击。¤It seems that it is the long hours of forced cultivation that has put too much strain on his internal organs and meridians. But if he can go further in his {color=#d0380a}qi dao{/color}sense and reach the realm of the true state of the dao, he will be able to protect himself from the impact of the fluctuating aura.
不过此事与你无关，我知道其中风险，也自有分寸。¤But this is none of your business, I know the risks and I have my own agenda.
他执意要继续修炼，你也无可奈何。但你隐约觉得，靠这种方式强行修炼下去，并没有成功的可能。¤He insists on continuing his cultivation, and there is nothing you can do about it. But you have a vague feeling that there is no chance of success in forcing your way through cultivation in this way.
这绝焰堂人数稀少行事低调，即使是咱们也接触不多，也不知道在鼓捣什么？¤This Absolute Flame Hall is so small and low key that even we don't have much contact with it, so I don't know what it's up to.
我救下她之后，她赠我丹药就没再联系了。¤After I saved her, she gifted me the potion and there was no further contact.
你听说了么？最近绝焰堂召回了宗门弟子。¤Have you heard? The Absolute Flame Hall has recently recalled the disciples of the clan.
说罢他向你展示了一颗丹药。¤With that he shows you an Pill.
打扰了。¤Excuse me.
{shixiong}也是修炼了魔焰决么？这丹药20000灵石就卖你吧¤Is {shixiong} also cultivating the Demonic Flame Duel? I'll sell you this Pill for 20000 spirit stones
唉，我早就劝你弃了这《魔焰决》的。¤Alas, I have long advised you to abandon this Magic Flame Duel.
我还有其他事，先告辞了。¤I have other things to do, so I'll take my leave.
嗨，也没什么好猜的，他们常年驻守麟庙听命于麟尊大人，多半是麟尊他老人家又有吩咐罢了。¤Hey, there's nothing to guess, they are always stationed at the Lin Temple to follow the orders of Lord Lin Zun, most probably because he has ordered them to do so again.
（脸色一白）嘶~¤(blushes) Hiss~
玄古门？玄古丹？衡州？¤Profound Ancient Sect? Profound Ancient Dan? Hengzhou?
...嗯¤... Hmmm
这玄古丹乃是衡州玄古门所炼制的丹药，即可增进修为又有益寿之效，更惊喜是似乎能弥补修炼魔焰决的气血亏空。¤This Profound Ancient Pill is a pill made by the Profound Ancient Sect in Heng Zhou, which can enhance cultivation and benefit longevity, and even more surprisingly, it seems to be able to make up for the Qi and blood deficit from practicing the Demonic Flame Duel.
嗯，而且麟庙彻底封门了，我上次误入直接被赶了出来。¤Well, and the Lin Temple is completely closed, and I was kicked straight out last time I entered by mistake.
你啊，你自己注意就好。¤You, ah, just take care of yourself.
修仙本就是逆天而行，旁人也没什么好置喙的。¤Cultivation of immortality is originally against the heavens, and there is nothing for the onlookers to say.
怎么，老毛病犯了？¤What's the matter, an old problem?
呶，这玄古丹就是。¤Look, this Profound Ancient Dan is it.
刚刚无意间听到，《魔焰决》的缓解之法故而冒昧请教。¤I have just overheard that the method of relieving the Magic Flame Duel has been developed, so I took the liberty of asking for advice.
你细细打量着手中的丹药。这丹药通体鲜红，透露出诡异的香甜。¤You examine the Pill in your hand carefully. The Pill is bright red in colour and reveals an eerie sweet aroma.
对对对，哈哈哈，我就是好奇。¤Yes, yes, yes, hahaha, I was just curious.
我曾救下一名来自衡州的修士，他就是玄古门弟子，我的玄古丹都是由他所赠。¤I once saved a cultivator from Hengzhou who was a disciple of the Profound Ancient Sect, and I owe all my Profound Ancient Pills to him.
没事，最近我已找到方法缓解了。¤It's okay, I've found ways to relieve it recently.
可否引荐一二？¤Can you give us a recommendation?
以我的资质想要有这种修炼速度，我有别的选择么？¤With my qualifications and wanting to cultivate at this speed, do I have any other choice?
天下奇门异术数不胜数也没什么好奇怪的。¤It is not surprising that there are countless strange arts in the world.
虽是许久无人维护，但是你仍可以看出此地是洞府的阵眼。¤Although it has been unmaintained for a long time, you can still see that this place is the front of the cave.
一番查探你发现此地的阵眼已经完全损坏。¤After some investigation, you found that the front eye here has been completely damaged.
一番查探你发现此地的阵眼尚未完全损坏，通过观察布阵手法你小有所得。¤After some investigation, you found that the formation eye here has not been completely damaged. You can gain a little by observing the formation technique.
嗯，消息已经传递到，告辞。¤Well, the message has been delivered, goodbye.
白帝飞升于宁州而言确是一件大事。¤The ascension of the White Emperor is indeed a great event for Ning Province.
多谢{FirstName}前辈。¤Thanks {FirstName} for your help.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来贵派邀请火麒麟前辈届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension, and has asked me to come to your school to invite the Fire Qilin to observe the ceremony at that time.
但火麒麟老祖闭关未出，只得等老祖神游而归，才能将此事告知。¤However, as the Old Fire Qilin Ancestor had not come out of seclusion, we had to wait for the Old Ancestor to return from his divine journey before we could tell him about this.
多谢{FirstName}道友。¤Thanks a lot {FirstName} Daoist.
公孙季的名号我倒是听说过，不过他为人低调，很少展露真实的实力，不知道他是否愿意与我切磋。¤I've heard of Gongsunji's name, but he is low-key and rarely shows true strength. I don't know if he is willing to discuss with me.
但近日实在无聊，同辈人中竟无人能在我手中取胜，不知道友可知哪位同辈英杰能与我一试高下？¤But it's really boring these days. No one of my peers can win in my hands. I don't know if you can know which peer hero can compete with me?
倪旭欣的名号我倒是听说过，不知道倪家的剑法他学了几成，正好向他讨教一番。¤I've heard of Ni XuXin's name, but I don't know how much he has learned Ni family's swordsmanship, so I just asked him for advice.
那就多谢{FirstName}{LastName}道友了。¤Then thank you fellow {FirstName}{LastName}.
你想了想，决定推荐...¤You think about it and decide to recommend...
哈哈，道友不必如此惊惶。我观你行色匆忙恐有要事，今日便不找道友切磋了！¤Haha, fellow daoists don’t have to be so alarmed. I think you may be in a hurry for something important, so I won’t find fellow daoists to discuss with you today!
你心里一惊，为了避免被他拉着比试连忙在脑内组织推辞的话语。¤You are shocked, in order to avoid being dragged by him, try to quickly organize refusing words in your brain.
林沐心的名号我倒是早有耳闻，听说她天赋异禀，年纪轻轻便筑基了，倒是个不错的对手。¤I've heard of Lin Muxin's name a long time ago. I heard that she is very talented and built her foundation at a young age, so she is a good opponent.
糟了，是百里奇...¤Oh, it's Bailiqi...
{FirstName}{LastName}道友留步！¤{FirstName}{LastName} Daoists stay!
我派在这几届猎魔试炼中都没什么出彩的表现，倒是让离火门那炎萧出尽了风头。¤My team hasn't done much in these few demon hunting trials, but it made Heavenly Fire Gate Yan Xiao show the limelight.
青麟虽是我派这一代天资最好的弟子，但性子却是过于温和了。¤Although Qinglin is the best talented disciple of my generation, but his temperament is too gentle.
杜兄也要多加小心才是，再会。¤Brother Du should also be more careful, goodbye.
在我小时候，禾山派为了修炼他们那邪道功法，便时常来我杜家村偷偷抓人。¤When I was a child, the Wo Shan Sect used to come to my village to arrest people secretly in order to practise their evil techniques.
眼见小弟落败，麻老九的处境也变得微妙起来。¤Seeing his little brother fall, Ma Laojiu's situation became delicate.
起初我爹娘以为只是些寻常山贼，便号召全村人奋起反抗，不料那些人竟是修士，我们这些凡人根本不是对手。¤At first, my parents thought they were just ordinary mountain bandits, so they called on the whole village to rise up against them, but to their surprise, they were cultivators and we mortals were no match for them.
之后，颜老怪就不停的派人在我们的地盘挑事。¤After that, Old Monster Yan kept sending people to pick fights in our territory.
再后来，沂山派的人找到了我，发现我身具灵根，就把我带回了沂山。¤Then later, people from the Yishan School found me and brought me back to Yishan when they discovered that I had spiritual roots.
哼，没用的东西，看我回去怎么收拾你。我们走。¤Hmph, useless thing, let's see how I'll deal with you when I get back. Let's go.
眼见麻老九落败，周遭的练气期修士瞬间作鸟兽散，麻老九也落荒而逃。¤Seeing that Ma Laojiu had lost, the surrounding Qi Practitioner cultivators instantly scattered, and Ma Laojiu also fled.
哈哈哈哈，看来你的小弟也不怎么顶用啊？¤Hahahahaha, looks like your little brother isn't very good either, huh?
修行本应追求长生之道，你父母一定更希望你好好活下去才对吧？¤Your parents must have wanted you to live a long life, right?
当初沂山派或许也只是想利用你的仇恨才拉你入伙的。¤In the beginning, the Yishan faction might have just wanted to exploit your hatred before pulling you into the fold.
谢了{xiongdi}。这次要不是你，我怕是要交代在这了。¤Thanks {xiongdi}. If it wasn't for you this time, I'm afraid I'd have to give up here.
杜老二的眼神流露出一丝坚毅。¤Du Lao Er's eyes showed a hint of determination.
眼见小弟落败，颜老怪的处境也变得微妙起来。¤Seeing the defeat of his youngest brother, Old Monster Yan's situation became delicate.
前段时间，我们大哥二哥莫名其妙死在了后山，也不知道是哪个王八蛋干的。¤Some time ago, our elder brother and second brother died inexplicably in the back of the mountain, and I don't know which son of a bitch did it.
没有了大哥二哥，我们根本不是那帮瘪三的对手，最后就只能散伙了…¤Without Big Brother and Big Brother, we were no match for those yakuza, so we had to break up in the end...
这事说来真他娘的蹊跷。¤It's a damned strange thing to say.
“当初除掉那二人只想是为民除害，顺便还能得个宝贝，没想倒是让禾山派一家独大了起来…”¤'I only wanted to get rid of those two people and get a treasure in the process, but I didn't think I'd let the Wo Shan Sect become a monopoly...''
待到麻老九走远，杜老二也支撑不住，栽倒在了地上。¤When Ma Laoji had gone far away, Du Laoji could not support himself and fell to the ground.
无妨。那人说沂山派散了，究竟是何缘由？¤No harm done. The man said that the Yishan School was scattered, what was the reason for that?
就算沂山派只是为了利用我也无关紧要，这仇要是不报，我修炼都没法安心。{xiongdi}你就别再劝我了。¤It doesn't matter if the Yishan faction is just using me, if I don't get this revenge, I can't even cultivate without peace of mind. {You should stop trying to persuade me.
你能感受到他语气中的决绝与恨意。¤You can feel the determination and hatred in his tone.
虽说这事后来上报了仙府，禾山派再也不敢这么猖狂了，但我爹娘却永远回不来了…¤Although the incident was later reported to the Immortal Government, the Wo Shan Sect no longer dared to be so rampant, but my parents could never return...
…此事又是从何说起？¤...and where does this matter begin?
这跟沂山派一点关系都没有，我跟禾山派本来就是不共戴天之仇。¤This has nothing to do with the Yishan School at all. I had an unbreakable feud with the Wo Shan School in the first place.
既然沂山派已然不复存在，禾山派的人为何还要追杀你？¤Since the Yishan School has ceased to exist, why are the people of the Wo Shan School still after you?
算你走运，今天就饶你们一回。我们走。¤Lucky for you, you'll be spared today. Let's go.
我要赶紧找地方疗伤了。今天的救命之恩，我会记在心里，后会有期。¤I must hurry to find a place to heal my wounds. I will remember the kindness of saving my life today, and I will see you later.
我爹娘带头反抗，就被最先抓了去…¤My parents led the resistance and were the first to be taken...
加入沂山派后，我每天拼命修炼，就是为了能报这一箭之仇。当年那些人，我非手撕了他们不可！¤After joining the Yishan School, I have been training hard every day just so that I can take revenge for this arrow. Those people back then, I had to tear them apart with my hands!
“没了沂山派制衡，这禾山派只怕更肆无忌惮了…结丹以后还是想办法治治他们吧。”¤'Without the Yishan School as a check and balance, this Wo Shan School will only become more unscrupulous...I'd better find a way to cure them after the Jie Dan.''
待到颜老怪走远，杜老二也支撑不住，栽倒在了地上。¤By the time Old Monster Yan was far away, Du Lao Er could not support himself and fell to the ground.
你的心情我理解…可是人死不能复生，你为了向他们寻仇，险些将命赔进去，真的值得嘛？¤I understand how you feel...but you can't come back from the dead...is it really worth risking your life to seek revenge on them?
他只是犹豫了一瞬。¤He hesitated for just a moment.
你发现了一株{SayStcVal=948}。¤You found a {SayStcVal=948}.
徐凡去准备这届的宗门大比了，如果能拔得头筹的话这次应该是筑基有望......¤Xu Fan has gone to prepare for the Zongmen Grand Competition. If he can get the top spot, this time it should be the foundation building...
唉，那徐凡又没能在门派大比中拿到筑基丹，一气之下竟放弃修炼外出云游寻找新的丹方了......¤Sigh, that Xu Fan failed to win the Foundation Pill in the sect tournament, so in a fit of anger he left to go wandering in search of new recipes...
哈哈哈，道友所取之物，完全符合物主的交换条件，道友一会儿可以凭此来任意挑选你想要换取的材料。¤Hahahaha, what you have taken is fully in line with the owner's terms of exchange, and you can use this to pick any material you wish to exchange for it in a moment.
不知...那物主想要用这些材料换些什么？想来普通的东西，他应该是看不上的吧。¤I don't know... What does the owner want in exchange for these materials? I guess he wouldn't be able to look at ordinary things.
诸位请看。¤All of you please see.
我阁只会根据交易物品的价值抽取一小部分灵石作为抽水。待交易成功后，便会通过传音符将物品送到诸位手中。¤Our pavilion will only take a small percentage of spirit stones as a draw based on the value of the item traded. Once the transaction is successful, the item will be delivered to you via a sound transmission talisman.
这付骨骸足以拆成数件土属性的六品材料，而若是能配合其它稀有材料合理加以炼制，炼成那通天灵宝也是大有希望。¤This skeleton is enough to be broken down into several earth-attribute sixth-grade materials, and if it can be reasonably refined with other rare materials, there is great hope that it can be refined into that heavenly spiritual treasure.
我这里倒是有他想要的材料，道友看看，可否用来换取这堕山骨骸？¤I do have the materials he wants here, so can you see if you can use them in exchange for the bones of this Fallen Mountain?
若单论价值而言，这瓶丹药的确在六品化神妖兽材料之上。但...¤If we talk about value alone, this bottle of Pill is indeed above the Sixth Grade Deity Transformation Spirit Beast material. But...
道友可愿出售这枚混元仙体丹？我愿意再加三成的价！¤Would Fellow Daoist like to sell this Mixed Immortal Body Pill? I am willing to increase the price by another 30%!
这点倒也不必担心。从今日起，我们天机阁的交易会将长期对各位元婴期的道友们开放。¤There is no need to worry about that. From today onwards, our trade fairs will be open to all Daoists of the YuanYing stage on a permanent basis.
怎么？我这枚可是能够提升化神成功率的混元仙体丹，而且炼制之法在宁州早已失传，难道还换不得那几块骨骸？¤What? I have a Hybrid Immortal Body Pill that can increase the success rate of Deity Transformation, and the method of refining it has long been lost in Ning Province, can't I still exchange it for those few bones?
不过若是寄换的宝物无人换取或是任何原因放弃寄换，我们都会退换全部的费用。¤However, if the item sent for exchange is not taken or is abandoned for any reason, we will refund the full cost of the item.
你的手头恰好有符合兑换需求的妖兽材料，你决定...¤You happen to have on hand the Spirit Beast material that meets the exchange requirements and you decide...
这堕山大圣的名号如今虽已无人提起，但万余年前也是赫赫有名的一方妖圣。当年它到底是因何陨落，至今仍是一个谜团。¤Although the name of the Fallen Mountain Sage is no longer mentioned today, it was a famous demon saint more than 10,000 years ago. The reason for its fall remains a mystery to this day.
此言一出，台下众人不免一阵骚动...¤At these words, the crowd on stage was in an uproar...
怎么样，道友意下如何？¤What do you think, friend?
这...果真是化神期妖兽的遗骸。难...难道是那{$yaoshou}？¤This... It really is the remains of a Spirit Beast at the Deity Transformation stage. Hardly... Could it be that {$yaoshou}?
确有听到风声，那{$yaoshou}不知被何人斩杀了。我还只当是谣言，难道...¤I did hear a rumour that that {$yaoshou} had been beheaded by some unknown person. I thought it was just a rumour, could it be...
那物主想要炼制一柄契合他自身使用的通天灵宝。五品元婴期妖兽的材料虽说也很稀有，但想凭此炼制通天灵宝，却是绝无可能的，这点道友应该清楚。¤The owner of that object wants to refine a Heavenly Spiritual Treasure that is suitable for his own use. Although the materials of a fifth-grade YuanYing stage Spirit Beast are also rare, it is absolutely impossible to refine a Heavenly Spiritual Treasure with this, and this point should be clear to Fellow Daoist.
竟是混元仙体丹？¤It's actually a Hybrid Immortal Body Pill?
那物主想要交换的物品，和这堕山的骨骸一样，乃是六品的化神期妖兽材料。而且必须是金属性，或是混元属性的材料。¤The item that the owner wanted to exchange was, like the bones of this Fallen Mountain, a sixth-grade Spirit Beast material of the Deity Transformation stage. And it had to be a metallic, or a material of the mixed element attribute.
哼，若只能换取灵石，我倒不如拿去拍卖，何必在此时拿出来。¤Hmph, if I can only exchange it for spirit stones, I might as well take it to auction, so why bring it out at this time.
那天机阁管事接过药瓶，拧开瓶盖嗅了嗅，便露出了极为惊讶的神情。¤That Steward of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion took the medicine bottle, unscrewed the cap and sniffed it, then revealed an extremely surprised look.
每次寄换，我们会抽取相当于目标物品价值2%的灵石作为抽水。¤For each consignment, we will take a draw of 2% of the target item's value in spirit stones.
若是诸位手头也有一些宝物，想要换取一些指定的物品，也可以来我这里登记。¤If you also have some treasures on hand and would like to exchange them for some specified items, you can also come and register with me.
哼！那若是今日在场无一人能够拿出符合他交易条件的物品，又当如何？¤Hmph! So what if no one present today can produce an item that meets his trading conditions?
道友莫急，此等重宝，我们天机阁自然是识货的。若这些材料本就归属于我阁，那我们定愿意拿来与道友交换。¤Daoist, don't be anxious. We at the Heavens Secrets Pavilion are naturally knowledgeable about such important treasures. If these materials belonged to us, then we would be willing to exchange them with you.
自然，若只是寻常能够用灵石买到的宝物，那也不必放到这交易会上来置换。¤Naturally, if it were just ordinary treasures that could be bought with spirit stones, then there would be no need to put them up for exchange at this fair.
不如这样，我愿意用五件水属性的元婴期妖兽材料，再加上一些稀有的草药与他交换，不知可否？！¤How about this, I'm willing to exchange five water-attributed YuanYing stage Spirit Beast materials, plus some rare herbs with him, I wonder if that's possible!
各位道友，我们天机阁此番受托，在拍卖大会结束后，额外举办的这场特殊的交易会，是为了拍卖几件特殊的宝物。¤Fellow Daoists, this special fair that we, the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion, have been entrusted to organise as an extra after the end of the Auction Conference is to auction off a few special treasures.
我这里也有一物，对于元婴期修士而言，价值犹在那堕山骨骸之上。你不妨先拿去问问那物主可愿与我交换。¤I also have something here that is worth more than the bones of the Fallen Mountain to a YuanYing stage cultivator. Why don't you take it to the owner and ask him if he is willing to exchange it with me?
此言一出，台下众人又是一阵骚动，一道道目光向你扫来，你能感受到其中有惊讶，羡慕，甚至贪婪与恐惧...¤At these words, the crowd on the stage stirred again, and a gaze swept towards you, you could feel the surprise, envy, even greed and fear...
他一挥手，只间一团蓝色的灵气包裹着一个精美的丹药瓶向高台飞去。¤He waved his hand, only for a cloud of blue aura to wrap around a fine potion bottle and fly towards the high platform.
根据我们的鉴定，这几件材料便是化神期妖兽堕山的骨骸。¤According to our identification, these materials are the bones of the Deity Transformation stage Spirit Beast Fallen Mountain.
所有价值低于一万灵石的物品，我阁都不会接取。¤All items worth less than 10,000 spirit stones will not be taken up by our Pavilion.
本次的交易会除了我刚刚提到的堕山大圣的骨骸外，还包括一些其它的稀有宝物。诸位若是感兴趣的话，可以来这里的告示上查看。¤This fair includes a number of other rare treasures in addition to the bones of the Fallen Mountain Sage that I have just mentioned. If you are interested, you can come and check out the notice here.
你挥挥手，一件青色的玉匣缓缓飞向高台。那名天机阁管事接过玉匣，打开一看，便惊讶道...¤You wave your hand and a green-coloured jade box slowly flies towards the high platform. The steward of the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion took the jade box, opened it and was surprised...
你跟着此人穿过长长的走廊，来到了一处布置的异常别致的屋子内。屋子很大，足以容纳百人，却只放置了十余张桌椅，远远的围成一圈。中间则是一座白玉雕成的高台，想来是用于展示宝物的。¤You follow this man through a long corridor and arrive inside a room that is unusually chicly decorated. The room is large enough to hold a hundred people, yet only a dozen tables and chairs have been placed in a circle far away. In the middle was a high platform carved out of white jade, presumably for the display of treasures.
你随意找了一处坐下。很快，其它前来参加交易会的修士也陆续抵达。他们中有的是你曾在拍卖会上见到过的，也有的则没有，想来是特地为了这交易会而来，这让你不免多了一些兴致。¤You find a random spot and sit down. Soon, other cultivators who have come to the fair arrive one after another. Some of them you have seen before at the auction, others not, and you think they have come especially for this fair, which makes you a little more interested.
天机阁的小型交易会，主要是为了方便诸位换取一些平日里有价无市的稀有宝物，因此对于寄换物品的价值也有一定的基础要求。¤The Heavens Secrets Pavilion's small trade fair is mainly to facilitate you to exchange for some rare treasures that are normally priced out of the market, and therefore there are certain basic requirements for the value of the items to be sent for exchange.
他一挥手，几块巨大的骨骸便浮现于高台之上。从这些骨骸上隐隐出来的威压与极为厚重的土属性灵气，就知道它们并非凡品。¤As soon as he waved his hand, several huge bones appeared on the high platform. From the pressure and the extremely heavy earth-attribute aura coming out of these bones, it was clear that they were not of ordinary quality.
不过既然这些材料是其它雇主委托我们天机阁交易的，我也没有权利擅自替他人更改交易的条件，还望道友见谅。¤However, since these materials were entrusted to our Tian Ji Pavilion by other employers for trading, I do not have the right to change the terms of the transaction for others without permission, so I hope you will forgive me.
这化神期妖圣哪个不是一方霸主？即便是同样化神期的前辈也不敢随意招惹他们，这样的交换要求，未免也太高了一些。¤Which one of these Deity Transformation Stage Demon Saints was not a party hegemon? Even seniors of the same Deity Transformation stage did not dare to provoke them at will. Such an exchange request was a little too high.
如何？用我这瓶丹药，想要换取那些堕山骨骸应该是绰绰有余了吧。若非这材料恰好与我合用，我是绝不会拿出来交易的。¤How about that? With this bottle of my Pill, it should be more than enough to exchange for those Fallen Mountain bones. If this material didn't happen to fit with me, I would never have taken it out in trade.
诸位若是手头一时拿不出符合要求的物品也无妨，只要你心仪的宝物还没有被其他人换去，都可以随时来此交易。¤If you can't get your hands on an item that meets your requirements at the moment, there is no harm in coming here to trade at any time, as long as your desired treasure has not been exchanged by someone else.
哈哈哈，其他道友也不必担心。从今日起，我们天机阁的交易会将长期对各位元婴期的道友们开放。¤Hahaha, there is no need for other Daoists to worry. From today onwards, our Heavens Secrets Pavilion's trade fair will be open to all Daoists of the YuanYing stage on a permanent basis.
你唯一想知道的事情只有渡劫之时将会是何情景，以及“太虚”究竟是为何物。于是，你径直走向了大殿，打算向掌门询问相关事宜。¤The only thing you want to know is what it will be like during the tribulation, and what the Great Void Dimension is. So, you walk straight to the main hall, intending to ask the Master about it.
无趣…¤Uninteresting...
修士们各自在房间内修行，或坐而论道，或切磋技艺，或处理事宜。此情此景虽与你初入宗门时并无二致，但其中之人你却少有相识。¤The cultivators are each practicing in their own room, sitting and discussing, sparring, or dealing with matters. The scene is the same as when you first entered the sect, but you know few of the people.
有趣~¤Interesting~
既然洞悉了一切，那么便再也没有初入宗门时那股新鲜与向往，这一切对于你而言只是“发生”了，仅此而已。¤Now that you have learned everything, you no longer have the freshness and yearning that you had when you first entered the clan, it just happens to you, that's all.
但长生路上千难万险，越到最后关头越是大意不得。想到此处，你便径直走向了大殿，打算向掌门询问相关事宜。¤But the road to immortality is a difficult and dangerous one, and the more you reach the final moment, the more careless you must be. With this in mind, you walk straight to the Great Hall, intending to ask the Master about the matter.
宛如神明一般，你能洞悉所有人，却没有人看见你，这种感觉……¤Like a god, you can see everyone but no one sees you, the feeling ......
你在宗门内漫步。不必刻意伸展神识，整个宗门的每个细节都被你探查的一清二楚。¤You stroll around the sect. Without having to deliberately stretch your soul sense, every detail of the entire clan is clearly probed by you.
这种凌驾于一切之上的感觉，让你觉得之前做的一切付出都是值得的，而你梦寐以求的长生大道，距离你也仅有一步之遥！¤This feeling of being above everything makes you feel that everything you've done before was worth the effort, and the longevity path you've been dreaming of is only one step away from you!
黑木老魔...¤Blackwood Old Devil...
这便是你在风雨楼所接悬赏的目标，但他此前毕竟与你相识...¤This is the target of the reward you received at the Storm House, but after all, he had known you before...
还是被你找到了。¤Or did you find it.
如此想来，当年确实曾听那沂山双鬼提到过他们有一个什么师傅去了海外渡劫...不会便是此人吧...¤If I think about it, I did hear the two ghosts of Mount Yi mention that they had a master who had gone overseas for the tribulation... Could it be this person...
也不知这毕长寿和他有没有关系...¤I wonder if this Bi Changshou has anything to do with him...
百毒老怪...听说他便是当年创立沂山派之人，只不过为了躲避仇敌才去了海外。¤The Hundred Poisonous Old Monsters... I heard that he was the one who founded the Yishan School back then, but he went overseas to escape from his enemies.
当年在永安镇除掉的那个叫毕钟天的村霸，似乎就有个不知在沂山派还是禾山道的爹。¤It seems that the village bully named Bi Zhongtian, who was eliminated in Yong'an Town back then, had a father who was not sure whether he was in the Yishan School or Wo Shan Road.
别逼我动手杀你。¤Don't make me do it to kill you.
毕长寿...¤Bi Changshou...
是{$name}...¤is {$name}...
就算你逃到天涯海角，我也会找到你。¤Even if you flee to the ends of the earth, I will find you.
王登...原来是他...¤Wang Deng... So it was him...
虽说是好色之徒，但应当也没做过什么太伤天害理之事。不该是惹了哪位惹不得的仙子，才遭来了这杀身之祸吧...¤Although he was a lustful man, he hadn't done anything too harmful to God. I don't think it was a fairy I couldn't have messed with that got him killed...
堂堂天魔道的元婴期长老，却偷偷摸摸潜伏于宁州。能趁此机会将他除去，倒也不错。¤He is a YuanYing stage elder of the Heavenly Demon Dao, but he is sneaking around in Ning Province. It would be good to take this opportunity to get rid of him.
此人便是风雨楼悬赏的目标，而眼下正是动手的大好时机！¤This man is the target of the reward offered by the Rain or Shine House, and now is the perfect time to strike!
此人便是风雨楼悬赏的目标，但在此地动手却并不明智...¤This man is the target of the reward offered by the Storm House, but it is not wise to strike here...
眼前之人看起来疯疯癫癫的，嘴里嘟嘟囔囔的不知在说些什么。¤The man in front of him looks crazy and is muttering something under his breath.
当年你没能留住我，现在也不行。¤You couldn't keep me then, and you can't now.
天儿...天儿...呜呜呜...都杀了...炼成肉参...桀桀桀...¤Tian'er... Tian'er... Oooooooo... Kill them all... Refined into meat... Jie Jie Jie...
哎...龙族虽然天赋异禀，但这种天赋也为天地所不容，所以金丹期蛟龙就必须渡过这样的雷劫才能化为真龙。¤Hey... Although the dragon family has a unique talent, this talent is also not tolerated by the world, so the Jindan stage Jiaolong must survive such a thunder tribulation to become a true dragon.
你将灵气灌入双目，目光穿透层层雷云，只间一条蛟龙盘踞于云端，双目直直地盯着天空。¤You poured spiritual energy into your eyes, and your eyes penetrated the layers of thunderclouds, only a Flood Dragon perched on the clouds, staring straight at the sky.
一道白光闪过，第一道天雷带着浩荡天威，已是落下。只见那蛟龙不闪不避，迎着雷劫便冲了上去，旋即便被劈的翻落了数百米。¤A white light flashed, and the first ray of thunder had already fallen with mighty celestial might. I saw that the Flood Dragon did not dodge or evade, and rushed up to meet the thunder tribulation, and immediately fell hundreds of meters after being split.
如此天地异象，莫非是有什么异宝将要出世？¤With such a vision of heaven and earth, could it be that some strange treasure is about to be born?
应该不是，你看，那雷云之中似乎有什么东西。¤It shouldn't, you see, there seems to be something in the thundercloud.
那是…蛟龙？原来是蛟龙在引化龙劫！¤Is that... Jiaolong? It turned out that the Jiaolong was inducing the Dragon Tribulation!
“轰隆...\"天空晴日里一声雷鸣炸响，顷刻间，天地随之色变。方圆数万里，一眼望不见尽头的区域，满是乌云。¤'Rumble... \'' A thunderclap exploded in the clear sky, and in an instant, heaven and earth changed colour. For tens of thousands of miles around, an area that could not be seen at a glance was filled with dark clouds.
起初的几道天雷看起来威力一般，但随着威力不断变强的天雷一道道落下，那蛟龙已被劈的遍体鳞伤，动作也开始迟缓了下来。¤The first few thunders seemed to be of average power, but as the increasingly powerful thunders fell one by one, the flood dragon had been slashed all over, and its movements began to slow down.
修真本就是逆天而行，追求强大的力量总是需要付出代价的。或许有一天，我也不得不直面这样的天劫吧...¤Cultivation is to go against the sky, and the pursuit of great power always requires a price. Maybe one day, I will have to face such a catastrophe...
{vpunch=10,0.5}轰...¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Boom...
随着最后一道天雷落下，本就摇摇欲坠的蛟龙再也无力支撑，从半空中坠落下来，漫天的乌云就此散去...¤As the last thunderbolt fell, the already crumbling Jiaolong could no longer support it and fell from mid-air, and the dark clouds in the sky dissipated...
先前从圣地离开恐怕已经引起了他们的注意，我还是不要自找麻烦了。¤The previous departure from the Holy Land may have attracted their attention. I still don't ask for trouble.
放心吧魏老，我对自己有十足的信心。¤Don't worry Wei Lao, I have complete confidence in myself.
哎...我明白你的心意。¤Oi... I understand your heart.
是，我明白。¤Yes, I understand.
不过若是渡劫时遇到任何意外，我都会主动停下秘术，到时你可切勿因此分心。¤However, if there are any accidents during the tribulation, I will take the initiative to stop the secret technique, so you must not be distracted by it.
作为你的师父，无论如何，我都为你感到骄傲。¤As your master, I am proud of you no matter what.
你神识触碰到它中心区域的一瞬间，就被它弹开了，难道是神魂受到了冲击？¤The moment your soul sense touched its central area, it bounced away, could it be that the soul was impacted?
这水晶当真有这么玄妙？你现在感受如何？¤Is this crystal really so mysterious? How do you feel now?
你努力回忆着过往，希望从中找到一丝丝线索 。¤You try to remember the past, hoping to find a hint of a clue from it .
是吗…是这样的吗？这就是所谓的机缘吗？¤Is that so...is that so? Is this the so-called chance?
我感觉像是做了一场很长很长的梦，但是又什么都想不起来……¤I feel like I had a long, long dream, but can't think of anything ......
刚刚那是什么？我感觉像是……做了一场梦？¤What was that just now? I feel like ...... had a dream?
习得{color=#d0380a}《忘凡咒》{/color}。¤Learned {color=#d0380a}'forget mortal incantation'{/color}.
你开始细细体会这种感觉，并尝试着去掌控它。¤You begin to experience this feeling in detail and try to master it.
你猛然醒来，只觉得脸上一片冰凉。手一摸，竟是眼泪。¤You wake up with a jolt, only to feel a cold face. The hand touches, but it is tears.
当你回忆到一些世俗的桥段时，你隐约察觉到了自己的不同——面对美酒佳肴，却没有了品尝的欲望；想起朋友亲人，也不再有当初的好感。有关凡人的一切，似乎都在离你远去。¤When you recall some worldly bridges, you vaguely perceive a difference in yourself - when faced with fine wines and delicacies, you have no desire to taste them; when you think of your friends and relatives, you no longer have the good feelings you had at the beginning. Everything about mortals seems to be leaving you.
不是……¤Not ......
我感觉很累…有种无力感，就好像失去了什么一样…¤I felt very tired...a sense of powerlessness, as if I had lost something...
“看来还真是不小的机缘…也好，你就安心感悟吧，{xiaozi}。”¤It seems to be no small chance...or, you just feel at ease, {xiaozi}.
没想到恒如真人与其亲传弟子竟是魔门卧底...不知门内还有多少受其迫害的修士。¤I didn't expect that Lord Eternal Harmony and his disciples were undercover agents of the demon sect... I wonder how many other within the sect were their victims.
你远远看到澹台仙被一众化尘教修士围在中间，看来对方应该没时间与你寒暄了。¤You see Immortal Tantai surrounded by a group of cultivators of the Aeonic Sands Temple from a distance. It seems that the other party should have no time to greet you.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，快看这是什么！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, look what this is!
另外我估摸着你的伤势应该是没有大碍了，不如我们这便去见师祖吧。¤In addition, I think your injuries should be no longer serious, why don't we go to see the master.
好，我也正有此意，还请倪兄带路了。¤Good, I also have this intention, also ask brother Ni to lead the way.
那我也不客气了，多谢倪兄。¤Then I will not be polite, thanks to Brother Ni.
倪旭欣神神秘秘的掏出来数枚红中带粉的果实，你虽说不出个名头，但也能感受到这些果实中大道流转，绝非凡物。¤Ni XuXin mysteriously pulled out several red with pink fruit, you can not say a name, but also can feel these fruits in the flow of the Avenue, absolutely extraordinary.
无聊之时，你也会将诛仙剑拿出，端详这把与你经历密不可分的“魔剑”。不过不知是你神魂还未恢复最佳状态，还是这“魔剑”又有了进阶，每当你想用神识探查剑内的情况时，散发出的神识总是如泥牛入海般消弭无踪。¤When you are bored, you will also take out the Immortal Sword and examine this 'magic sword' that is inseparable from your experience. But I don't know whether your soul has not yet recovered the best state, or this 'magic sword' has advanced, whenever you want to use the soul sense to explore the situation inside the sword, the soul sense always dissipates like a mud cow into the sea like no trace.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，师祖估摸着你的伤势应该是没什么大碍了，让我带你去见他。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, the master ancestor estimated that your injuries should be nothing serious, let me take you to him.
这...难道是从海底带出来的？¤This... Is it brought out from the bottom of the sea?
自白帝将你和倪旭欣从图南海带回南崖城已是有些时日，这段时间你也是在客房中调养一番，让自己的伤势稳定了下来。¤The {FirstName}some time has passed since the White Emperor brought you and Ni XuXin back to South Cliff City from Tu Nanhai, and during this time you have been in the guest room to recuperate a bit and stabilize your injuries.
嘿嘿，这是我们被古树甩出来的时候，我顺手薅下来的。这不有好几个，想着送{FirstName}{xiongdi}几个。¤Hey, this is when we were thrown out by the ancient tree, I gleaned it by hand. This is not several, thinking to send {FirstName}{xiongdi} a few.
“吱呀”一声，倪旭欣已是推门而入。这也是在回到南崖城之后，他首次进入你修养的房间。¤Creak, Ni XuXin is already pushing the door and enter. This is also the first time he entered the room where you are recuperating after returning to South Cliff City.
道友，我这里可都是我{SayStcVal=917}的珍品。¤Friends of Taoism, here are my treasures of {SayStcVal=917}.
你睁开双眼，只觉得眼前一片清明，原本昏暗的洞窟现在也能看的清清楚楚，想必夜视与远视的能力都得到了一定的提升。¤When you open your eyes, you only feel that there is a clear light in front of you. The originally dim cave can now be seen clearly. Presumably, the ability of night vision and hyperopia has been improved to a certain extent.
在岩壁凹陷处，你果然发现了一湾浅浅的清泉。若非先前打听到的情报，你绝对不会注意到它有任何特殊之处。¤In the depression of the rock wall, you really found a shallow clear spring. If it weren't for the information you've previously inquired about, you would never have noticed anything special about it.
你睁开双眼，这一次与之前不同，你觉得自己的眼前浮现出一丝淡淡的蓝光。¤You open your eyes. This time is different from before. You feel a faint blue light in front of your eyes.
你结了个法印，泉水便自动分为两团碧蓝晶莹的液体，慢慢漂浮到空中，然后飞入你的双目之中。¤You form a seal, and the spring water automatically divides into two azure crystal liquids, slowly floating into the air, and then flying into your eyes.
你将灵力向目中猛然灌去，再向周围望去时，只觉得周天一切事物都清晰数倍，你甚至能够清晰的看到天地间灵气的流转。¤You will be the spiritual power to the eyes fierce, and then look around, only to feel that everything around the sky are clear several times, you can even clearly see the flow of spiritual energy between heaven and earth.
你放出神识探查泉水，一股霸道的阴寒气息侵入你的神魂...看来这便是传闻中提到的阴冥泉水了。¤You put out your soul sense to explore the spring, a domineering cold aura invaded your soul ... It seems that this is the Yin Underworld Spring mentioned in the rumors.
心境{color=#d0380a}+20{/color}，神识{color=#d0380a}+1{/color}¤Mental state{color=#d0380a}+20{/color}, divine consciousness{color=#d0380a}+1{/color}
之前收集的草药都用完了，看来还得再收集几份才行。¤The herbs I collected before are all used up, it seems that I have to collect a few more copies.
看来仅仅用这灵泉清洗一次双目并没有太大的功效，想让双目练就某种神通，还得多找几口泉水才行。¤It seems that just using this spiritual spring to cleanse the eyes once is not very effective, want to let the eyes to practice some kind of divine ability, but also have to find a few more springs to do.
这泉水初入双目时冰寒刺骨，令你不由自主的打了个冷战。足足过了半个多时辰，寒意才渐渐退去。¤When the spring water first entered your eyes, it was icy and bitter. It made you involuntarily fight a cold war. It took more than half an hour before the chill gradually receded.
若是此时有人站在你的身前，应该会惊讶地发现，你的两只瞳孔分别变换为了一黑一白的两种颜色。¤If someone stands in front of you at this time, you should be surprised to find that your two pupils have changed into two colors, one black and one white.
习得：{color=#d0380a}阴阳瞳{/color}¤Acquisition: {color=#d0380a}Yin and Yang pupil{/color}
你将一株腐骨灵花与七彩月兰放入泉水中泡发。整整一日后，泉水已呈碧蓝色泽，说明大部分的药性皆被泉水吸收。¤You put a Earth Matriarch Petal and a Rainbow Moon Orchid into the spring water to soak it. After a whole day, the spring water has turned blue, indicating that most of the medicinal properties are absorbed by the spring water.
只是这种状态仅仅持续了数秒，你灌入双目的灵气便已消耗殆尽。¤It's just that this state only lasts for a few seconds, and your binocular aura is exhausted.
你想继续追击时，那黑烟迅速地消散在了空气中。¤When you wanted to continue pursuing, the black smoke quickly dissipated into the air.
你在这里彻底混乱前翻遍了连盛平的居所，最终找到了一本诡秘的功法。这本功法似乎有些眼熟，你定睛一看，赫然是先前在圣坛修习了开篇的那本灭灵诀。¤You rummaged through Lian Shengping's residence before being completely chaotic here, and finally found a secret technique. This technique seems to be familiar. When you look closely, it is impressive that you have practiced at the altar before. That Ling Ling Jue.
不管怎么说这本功法的强劲你有所体会，你决定先把它带走再仔细考虑是修练还是出售。¤Anyway, you know the power of this exercise. You decide to take it away first and then carefully consider whether to practice or sell it.
你的灵气如摧枯拉朽般向连盛平袭去，就在他即将命丧于你这攻击下时一阵浓重的血雾袭来。只见连盛平的身体在空中扭曲变形,最终化为一团黑烟，避开了致命一击。¤Your spiritual energy is attacking Lian Shengping like a ruin, and when he is about to lose his life under your attack, a thick blood mist hits. I saw Lian Shengping's body twisted and deformed in the air, and finally turned into one. A cloud of black smoke avoided the fatal blow.
或许是他受创过重，无力支撑千流岛迷阵的消耗；又或许是他因距离过远，失去了对阵法的控制权...你能感受到一直笼罩着千流岛的怪异气息正逐渐散去，要不了多久这里便能完全摆脱连盛平的掌控。¤Perhaps he suffered too much damage and was unable to support the consumption of Qianliu Island's maze; or maybe he lost control of the formation due to the distance too far... You can feel the weirdness that has been covering Qianliu Island all the time. The breath is gradually dissipating, and it won't be long before Lian Shengping can completely get rid of the control of Lian Shengping.
魏无极的声音重新在你脑海中响起，你镇定心神，把刚刚看到的景象向魏无极一一转述。¤Wei Wuji's voice resounds in your head and you calm your mind, relaying to Wei Wuji what you have just seen.
我遇到的第二个幻象，用的似乎是金虹剑派的招法。¤The second illusion I encountered used what appeared to be a move of the Golden Rainbow Sword School.
不过你当时应该就已经陷入了幻境，六感都被隔绝，所以无法与我交流。没过多久，你就开始对着附近胡乱攻击，我也束手无策。¤But you would have been caught in an illusion by then, and all six senses were cut off, so you couldn't communicate with me. It wasn't long before you started attacking randomly in the vicinity, and I was at my wits' end.
令人在不知不觉中陷入幻觉，随后再用根须扎根将他们身上的灵气抽干。对于境界稍低之人，甚至能直接灌输大道感悟，令其神魂失守。¤They are then drained of their aura by the roots. For those at a slightly lower level, they can even directly instil a sense of the Great Dao, causing them to lose their souls.
刚刚你走了没多久，我便发现那些原本静止不动的根须开始慢慢朝着我们移动。¤Not long after you left, I noticed that the roots, which had been stationary, slowly began to move towards us.
当年与倪兄来此时，虽然也曾陷入幻境，但与今日的感觉却截然不同，也不知这其中到底有何差异...¤When I came to this place with Brother Ni, although I had also fallen into an illusionary realm, the feeling was very different from today... I don't know what the difference is...
好险...若是被这些根须缠住，再想脱身就难免会惊动那古树本体了。¤That was close... If we were to get entangled in these roots, it would be inevitable that we would alert the ancient tree itself if we tried to get out again.
能够操控四柄魔剑的魔修，和实力强大的金虹剑派修士...他们有什么关联么？¤A evil cultivator who can control four demonic swords and a powerful Golden Rainbow Sword Sect cultivator... Do they have any connection?
我遇到的第二个幻象，他用的招法似乎是...金虹贯日？¤The second illusion I encountered, the move he used seemed to be... Golden Rainbow?
怎么了？刚刚发生什么了！¤What's going on? What just happened!
我是何时陷入幻境的？¤When did I fall into the illusion?
好在诛仙剑释放了此前从这古树中吸收的能量，现在这些根须看起来对你没什么敌意了。¤It is good that the Immortal Punishing Sword has released the energy it previously absorbed from this ancient tree, and now these roots don't seem to have any hostility towards you.
师兄曾说过，可以把这神秘的古树看做是道的化身，但它攻击别人的方式却处处透露着邪门与诡异，与我所熟知的大道正统相悖...¤Brother had said that one could see this mysterious ancient tree as an incarnation of the Tao, but the way it attacked others revealed evil and weirdness in every way, contrary to the orthodoxy of the Tao that I knew...
身后的诛仙剑突然微微颤抖，你感觉一股似曾相识的能量包裹周身，眼前的幻象也消散一空。¤The Immortal Punishing Sword behind you suddenly trembles slightly, you feel a déjà vu energy wrap around you and the illusion before you dissipates into thin air.
凭你如今修为，竟也会在不知不觉中陷入幻境，这古树还真是不可小觑。¤With your current level of cultivation, you could unknowingly fall into an illusionary realm. This ancient tree is really not to be underestimated.
不知道...¤I don't know...
嗯。不知青麟兄遇到了什么瓶颈？若能帮的上忙，在下一定鼎力相助。¤Hmm. I wonder what bottleneck Brother Qinglin has encountered? If I can be of any help, I will definitely help.
只见他眉间微蹙，神情略显犹豫。¤He was seen with a slight frown between his brows and a slightly hesitant look.
只是师尊教我的新功法，还有些生疏罢了。¤It's just that I'm still a bit rusty with the new kung fu method my master taught me.
道友，请指教。¤Please enlighten us, my fellow Taoist.
你二人飞至九嶷山上一处僻静之地。¤You two fly to a secluded place on Jiuyi Mountain.
此地较为僻静，不会被人打扰，倒是个切磋的好地方。¤This is a secluded area where no one will disturb you, so it is a good place for a sparring session.
先鉴别药材，再搜集丹方，又准备丹炉，然后耗以日月……哪里及得上直接从我这买方便？¤First identify the medicinal materials, then collect the pill, prepare the pill furnace, and then consume the sun and the moon... How can it be convenient to buy directly from me?
能不能教教我怎么炼丹？¤Can you teach me how to make alchemy?
仔细再看的话，这几簇都是七叶的，凡人尚可一用。那两簇四叶的，药性恐怕还比不上普通的止血草。¤If you look at it carefully, these clusters are all seven leaves, and mortals can still use them. Those two clusters of four-leaf leaves are probably not as medicinal as ordinary hemostatic herbs.
嗯...据说这青芝只有在无尽海渊灵力集中之处才容易形成三叶，想来也确不会像这般在野外成簇生长。¤Hmm... It is said that this Qingzhi can only easily form three leaves in the place where the spiritual power of the endless ocean is concentrated, and it is true that it will not grow in clusters in the wild like this.
恐怕不是，这三叶青芝即便在无尽海渊中也属于极其稀有的草药。像这种比较明显的地方若是有的话，也早就被采完了，哪里轮得到我们。¤I'm afraid not, this three-leaf green lucidum is an extremely rare herb even in the endless abyss. If there were any obvious places like this, they would have been harvested long ago, so where can we get them.
转眼望去，一旁的山脚下，长着一簇簇与三叶青芝九分相似的草药。¤In the blink of an eye, at the foot of the mountain on the side, there are clusters of herbs that are nine points similar to Sanye Qingzhi.
这颜色，这纹路...莫非是三叶青芝？¤This color, this texture... Could it be Sanye Qingzhi?
不过，现在这门技术在我看来有着难以解决的弊端。¤However, this technique now has, in my opinion, an insurmountable drawback.
眼前之人早就不似之前神勇，气息虚弱呼吸局促，一时之间都站立不稳。¤The man in front of him was no longer as brave as before, his breath was weak and shortness of breath, and he could not stand still for a while.
（看来此人刚刚的表现是激发潜能的丹药不能持久。）¤(It appears that this person has just shown that the potion that stimulated the potential did not last.)
我平时会在天星城坊市售卖丹药，道友若是有空可以来找我。¤I usually sell pills at the Heavenly Star City Market, so if you are free, you can come and see me.
正好试试我这炼妖散和灵纹。¤Just in time to try out my demon refining scatter and spirit patterns.
讲究的是将妖兽血脉融于自身以修为精进易经伐髓，甚至可以获得妖兽神通。¤It is about fusing the bloodline of the Spirit Beast into oneself to refine one's cultivation and refine one's meridian, and one can even obtain the divine ability of the Spirit Beast.
不过，现在这“一次性”的灵纹实非我所愿啊，果然这项技术还是大有问题。¤However, this ''disposable'' spirit pattern is not what I wanted, so there is still something wrong with this technique.
轩岚诺周身火焰一起直冲对面，对面的人连发法术却不能伤其分毫。¤The flames around Xuan Lanuo's body came together and charged straight across the room, and the people on the other side of the room could not hurt him even a little bit with their spells.
至于火系神通，我是用了豹麟兽的精血，于双掌之上铭刻了灵纹。¤As for the Fire Avatar, I have used the blood of the Leopard Lin Beast to inscribe a spiritual pattern on both palms.
轩岚诺皱着眉头凝视掌心，之后看向你。¤Xuan Lanuo stares at his palm with a zouched brow, before looking at you.
道友似乎有很多想问的？¤Do you seem to have a lot to ask?
哼，尽是些宵小之辈。¤Heck, it's all about the curmudgeons.
{FirstName}道友，救命大恩无以为报，这炼妖散是我最新炼制的，与人相斗必有大用，不过丹毒甚猛，还需与其他丹药搭配服用。¤{This is my newest product, which will be of great use in a fight with someone, but the poison is very strong and needs to be taken in conjunction with other pills.
这炼妖散在本门是一个尚在研究中的秘药。¤This Demon Refining Pill is a secret medicine that is still under research in our school.
阻挡你的人尚不是你一合之敌，处理完他阵法也就破了，你看向轩岚诺。¤The man who is blocking you is not yet a match for you, and after you have dealt with him the formation will be broken, so you look to Xuan Lanuo.
一道炙热的火焰从其掌中喷出，直接洞穿对方。为首之人身死，围攻玄古门的散修也作鸟兽散。¤A hot flame erupted from his palm, piercing right through his opponent. The leader of the group was killed, and the independent cultivators surrounding the Profound Ancient Sect scattered like birds and beasts.
看道友这大展神威的样子，显得我很多余嘛。¤Look at this great display of power by your friend, it looks like I have a lot of spare time.
浴火之时我不过是使用了含有豹麟血的炼妖散罢了。¤During the bath of fire I was merely using a demon refining scatter containing leopard-lin blood.
我服用的是我自己改良的炼妖散，主要还是用于战时瞬时激发妖力。¤I take my own modified demon refining powder, which is still mainly used to instantly stimulate demon power in times of war.
只见他一掐法诀，一条火龙直逼轩岚诺而去。¤As soon as he saw the spell, a fire dragon only forced Xuan Lanuo to go.
你这！！！？？？¤What are you!!!?
唉，要是就好了，我并非妖族，刚刚是我服用了我自己改良的炼妖散。以药力催发妖族精血的妖力。¤Alas, if only, I am not a demon, I have just taken my own improved Demon Refining Pill. Using the power of the medicine to stimulate the demonic power of the demon blood.
只见他服下一粒丹药，眼睛化作蛇瞳，一股强横的妖气自他的体内迸发而出。¤As he took a pill, his eyes transformed into snake pupils and a strong demonic aura burst out from his body.
轩岚诺提起双掌，掌心似有灵纹显现，竟毫发无损的击散了这火龙。¤Xuan Lanuo lifted his palms, and with what appeared to be spiritual patterns in his palms, he was able to dispel the fire dragon without any damage.
轩岚诺苦笑的抬起双掌。¤Xuan Lanuo lifted both palms with a bitter smile.
不愧是{FirstName}道友，一点就通。¤Not bad for a {FirstName} dawg, a little bit of it goes a long way.
（好大的野心。）¤(So ambitious.)
刚刚看道友爆发出强横的妖气，莫非道友乃是？¤I just saw you explode with a strong demonic aura, could it be that you are?
道友小心。¤Daoist beware.
呼~呼~~多谢道友相助，你就莫要调笑我了，若不是你出手破了阵法，今日我就着了这些小人的道了。¤Hoo~Hoo~~ Thank you for your help, don't tease me, if you hadn't broken the formation with your hand, I would have fallen for these villains today.
妖兽血脉，自古以来不知引得多少修士垂涎，道友有此成果已是惊世骇俗了。假以时日必能成功。¤The bloodline of Spirit Beasts has been coveted by many cultivators since ancient times, and your achievement is already astonishing. With time, you will be able to succeed.
死。¤Death.
切。装神弄鬼，受死吧。¤Cut. Play God and die.
此时，你注意到他眼瞳恢复正常，连掌心的灵纹也在快速消退。¤At this point, you notice that the pupils of his eyes are returning to normal, and even the spirit lines on his palms are rapidly fading.
之前看你浴火而无伤且能瞬发天阶火系神通，观道友气息不像是精于火之道的。¤I saw that you were unharmed by the fire and were able to instantly launch a Heavenly Fire Avatar, and I saw that your breath did not look like you were skilled in the Way of Fire.
呵呵，萤火之光。¤Oh, the light of the glowing fire.
炼妖散？¤Demon Refining San?
佩服，佩服。¤I admire you.
噢？¤Oh?
有意思。¤interesting.
这颗筑基丹你且拿好，我百里奇向来说话算话！¤Take this Foundation Establishment Pill, I am a man of my word!
哈哈哈，此战真乃酣畅淋漓，我百里奇甘拜下风。快快请进，在下还想再与道友讨教一二！¤Hahaha, this battle is really hearty, I'm Bailiqi willing to go down the wind. Please come in quickly, and I want to ask the daoists for advice again!
连我三招都接不下...可惜，可惜...¤I can't even take three tricks... a pity, a pity...
快快请进，在下还想再与道友讨教一二！¤Please come in quickly, I would like to discuss with you a little more!
哈哈哈，此战真乃酣畅淋漓，我百里奇甘拜下风。¤Hahahaha, this battle was really a good one, I, Bailiqi, am willing to pay homage.
（嗯，我马上过来。）¤(Well, I'll be right over here.)
（看这灵气波动，前方好像有个阵法，虽然看起来像是没什么，但神识探测却阻挡在外，难道...神识传音通知{$Lin}过来吧。）¤(Looking at the fluctuations of spiritual energy, there seems to be a formation in front of it. Although it looks like nothing, the detection of soul sense is blocked. Could it be... Divine Consciousness sound transmission to notify {$Lin} to come here.)
唔，宫主的神识好像消失了，我感应不到。¤Well, the consciousness of the palace lord seems to have disappeared, I can't feel it.
你与林沐心会合后便一起进入阵中。¤After you meet with Lin Muxin, you will enter the formation together.
（我在附近找到一个阵法，宫主说不定就被困阵中。）¤(I found a formation nearby, and the palace master might be trapped in the formation.)
可能是进入了什么特殊的秘境或阵法一类，我们在附近找找吧。\n¤It may be some kind of special secret realm or formation, let's look for it nearby. \n
也许是我的错觉的吧，¤Maybe it's just me.
你细细感知之下此地也和别处没有什么不同。¤It is no different from anywhere else when you look at it.
眼前雷云草草看去，这片雷云和周围狂暴的灵气乱流没有什么不同¤The thundercloud in front of you is no different from the violent aura turbulence around you, when you look at it hastily
看着并无不同，但是习自炎帝前辈秘术却对此处有所反应，这里应该就是九霄雷狱的节点。¤It does not look different, but the secret techniques learnt from the Yan Di's predecessors react to this place, which should be the node of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison.
说罢，你平心静气闭上眼感知那一缕若有若无的先天之气，顺着它的指引你发现了一处空间节点。¤Saying this, you calmly close your eyes and sense the wisp of innate Qi, if any, and following its guidance you find a spatial node.
你感觉习自炎帝的秘术开始不自觉的运转了，一丝丝先天之气透过肌肤荡涤着你的肉身。¤You feel the secret techniques you learned from the Emperor of Yan begin to work unconsciously, and a trace of innate Qi swells through your skin and cleanses your flesh.
眼前的异空间充斥着恐怖的天雷，一阵阵毁灭的气息四散开来，煌煌天威不可阻挡。¤The alien space before us is filled with terrifying heavenly thunder, and a destructive aura spreads out in all directions, a glorious heavenly might unstoppable.
你感觉此地的灵力波动与雷灵很是相似。¤You feel that the spiritual energy fluctuations here are very similar to those of the Thunder Spirit.
看着并无不同，但此地的波动与雷灵很是相似，这里应该就是九霄雷狱的节点。¤It doesn't look different, but the fluctuations here are very similar to those of the thunder spirits, and this should be the node of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison.
怎么？此地有什么不同么？¤What? What's different about this place?
可惜，让他给跑了。¤Unfortunately, let him run away.
呼...多谢道友出手相助。¤Huh... Thanks for your help.
这千流岛的独门道法果然厉害得紧，若不是道友出手，恐怕我已经...¤The unique Taoism of Qianliu Island is really strong. If it weren't for a fellow Taoist, I'm afraid I would already...
（实力暴涨的秘术...原来如此...）¤(The secret technique of skyrocketing power... so it is...)
（好邪门的功法...怪哉，怪哉...）¤(Good evil technique...weird, weird...)
那边的岩洞里有好几株千年的月灵花，想必是正巧吸收了某处灵眼的灵气才能同时长出这么多。我们就是为它起的争斗。¤There are several thousand-year-old Moonspirit Blossoms in the cave over there. It must have absorbed the qi of a spirit vein to grow so many at the same time. We are fighting for it.
那千流岛修士不知用了什么法门，身形忽然暴涨，几招将你逼退后，便化作一道遁光飞也似地逃走了。¤The cultivator of Qianliu Island didn't know what method he used, and his figure suddenly soared. After a few tricks forced you back, he turned into a fledgling light and fled away.
之前就听闻千流岛有一种在短时间内让实力暴涨的秘术，颇为诡异。再加上独门神通灭灵掌，在海上基本没有同等修为的修士敢惹他们。¤Before I heard that Qianliu Island had a secret technique that allowed the strength to skyrocket in a short period of time. It was quite weird. Coupled with the unique magical ability to destroy the soul palm, there are basically no cultivators of the same cultivation level on the sea who dare to provoke them.
自然...自然，这几株月灵花归能者所有，道友尽管取走便是，我这便离去，绝对不会再有任何想法。¤Naturally...Naturally, these Moonspirit Blossoms belong to one worthy of them. Please help yourself Fellow Daoists. I will leave to give you space.
道友本就于我有救命之恩，这几株灵药就当是我从道友手里买下的，这些灵石还请道友不要拒绝。¤Friends of Daoist have a life-saving grace because of me, so I have bought these spiritual medicines from fellow daoists. Please don't refuse these spiritual stones.
那...那真是多谢道友了！¤Then...that's really thank you fellow Daoist!
我对这月灵花没什么兴趣，你若需要的话，全部拿去便是了。¤I have no interest in the Moonspirit Blossoms. If you need it, you can take it all.
你开始着手修缮此地阵法。¤You started to fix the formation here.
是来修缮阵法的长老大人？¤Is it the elder who is here to fix the formation?
也不知阵法有什么异变，此番长老竟花费了如此之久。¤I don't know what's changed in the formation, this time the elders actually spent so long.
此地阵法不过一些简单的聚灵、防御阵法，不过数量不少，倒也花费些时日。¤The formation here is just a few simple spirit gathering and defensive formations, but there are a lot of them, and it takes some time.
长老定是精通阵道的高手，短短十数日便完成了任务。¤The elder must be a master who is proficient in formation, and he has completed the task in just ten days.
呼~以我的阵法修为，恰好足矣修缮此地阵法。¤Phew~ With my formation cultivation, it is just enough to repair the formation here.
呼~~这阵法之道果然博大精深，我还是不是很擅长这类任务啊。¤Phew~~ this way of formation is really profound, I'm still not very good at these kinds of tasks.
嗯，我已完成掌门交代的事宜。¤Well, I have completed the matters explained by the master.
你离开时，听到远处执事的自言自语。¤When you left, you heard the deacon in a distance talking to himself.
此地阵法的修复对你而言不算容易，但仔细钻研一下还是完成了任务。¤The restoration of the formations in this area was not easy for you, but a careful delving into the task was accomplished.
此地阵法的修复对你甚是困难，但凭你金丹期的见识还是花费不少时间勉强修复了。¤The restoration of the formations in this area was very difficult for you, but with your Golden Dan stage insight it still took quite a bit of time to reluctantly repair them.
此地阵法的结构对你而言甚是简单，但数量繁多还是花费了一些时日。¤The structure of the formations in this area is very simple for you, but the sheer number of them still took some time.
不错，我派掌门真人突破在即。此番前往宁州古迹，我派的重要目标便是收集这些草药，特别是在宁州极为少见的炼心芝，以便炼制草药。¤Yes, our Sect Leader is on the cusp of a breakthrough. We seek to explore ancient ruins in Ning Province, with the goal of finding rare herbs, especially the very rare Heartrend Shroom.
咦，莫非是竹山宗的{FirstName}长老？在宁州久闻你的名号，今日一见果然不同凡响。¤Hey, could it be the {FirstName} elder of the Bamboo Mountain Sect? I heard your name in Ning Province for a long time, and I saw it today.
咦，莫非是离火门的{FirstName}长老？在宁州久闻你的名号，今日一见果然不同凡响。¤Hey, could it be the Elder {FirstName} from the Heavenly Fire Gate? I heard your name in Ning Province for a long time, and I saw it today.
原来是鸢本仙子。许久未见，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤So it is Fairy Yuanben. I have not seen you for a long time, so if we meet in the monuments this time, please take care of us.
细细想来我化尘教掌门闭关也有近五百年，此次历练结束，也不知掌门能否出关。¤Thinking about it, the head of the Aeonic Sands Temple has been in retreat for nearly 500 years. After this experience, I don't know whether the head can leave.
不知道友可否见过我座下亲传弟子...？方才还见他在此等候，可临行时却又不见踪影......¤I don't know if your friend has seen my disciple...? I saw him waiting here, but he was gone when he left...
原来是化尘教门的鸢本仙子，久仰大名，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤Ah it is Lady Yuanben of the Aeonic Sands Temple. Your fame proceeds you. If we happen to meet again within the ruins, let us watch each other's backs.
我听说，贵派近日在四处收集有生息药性的高阶草药？¤I heard that your school is collecting high-end herbs with great medicinal properties in various places recently?
不知{$TmpTalkString}可否见过我座下亲传弟子...？方才还见他在此等候，可临行时却又不见踪影......¤I wonder if {$TmpTalkString} has met my personal disciple...? I just saw him waiting here, but he was nowhere to be seen when he was about to leave ......
{$TmpTalkString}若是能寻得此类草药，不知可否出让与我派？我们定会以重金收购。¤{$TmpTalkString}If such herbs can be found, I wonder if they can be offered to our sect? We will certainly buy it for a heavy price.
{$TmpTalkString}客气了。¤{$TmpTalkString} You're welcome.
咦，莫非是星河剑派的{FirstName}长老？在宁州久闻你的名号，今日一见果然不同凡响。¤Hey, could it be the {FirstName} elder of the Galaxy Sword Sect? I heard your name in Ning Province for a long time, and I saw it today.
咦，莫非是金虹剑派的{FirstName}长老？在宁州久闻你的名号，今日一见果然不同凡响。¤Hey, could it be the {FirstName} elder of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect? I heard your name in Ning Province for a long time, and I saw it today.
据说，只要能够在千流岛设下的擂台上展露头角，就有机会成为连家供奉，学到他们的独门秘术。哎...师妹也是因此才一个人去了那里。¤It is said that as long as you can show your prowess in the arena set up in Qianliu Island, you will have the opportunity to become a guest elder of the Lianjia family and learn their unique secret skills. Hey...this is why the younger sister went there alone.
师妹此番去了千流岛以后，已经很久没有音讯了...也不知道现在情况如何。¤After the junior sister went to Qianliu Island, there has been no news for a long time... I don't know what the situation is now.
这千流岛位于千流海域，岛上的连家也算是无尽之海上的一大势力，传承的功法神通颇有几分威名。¤This Qianliu Island is located in the sea area of Qianliu, and the Lianjia on the island can be regarded as a major force in the endless sea, and the inherited powers are quite prestigious.
这是一片沉在海底的废墟。你朝着反光的方向游去，最终找到了一座残破的祭坛，其上插着一块半透明的“水晶”。¤This is a wreck that sinks to the bottom of the sea. You swim in the direction of the reflection and eventually find a broken altar with a translucent crystal stuck in it.
一道海底的反光引起了你的注意，你随即便潜入海中，打算一探究竟。¤A reflection on the bottom of the sea caught your attention, and you immediately dived into the sea to find out.
也有可能不是矿石…我隐隐感觉这不是凡物。带去采筠阁问问吧，或许那里的人会认识。¤It may not be ore... I have a faint feeling that this is not a mortal thing. Take it to Caijun Pavilion and ask, maybe people there will know.
这是…一种特殊的矿石？但为何要放在祭坛上？¤This is... a special kind of ore? But why put it on the altar?
也有可能不是矿石…我隐隐感觉这不是凡物。先带在身上吧，说不定有什么人能鉴别此物。¤It may not be ore... I have a faint feeling that this is not a mortal thing. Take it with you first, maybe someone can identify this thing.
救助也好，劫财也罢，善与恶只在一念间，随心而动即可。¤It doesn't matter whether you are helping or robbing money, good and evil are only in one thought, and you can move with your heart.
也不知掌门何时闭关归来...化尘之道讲求中庸二字，你且慢慢体悟。¤I don't know when the headmaster will return from retreat... The way of removing dust emphasizes the two characters of the mean, and you can slowly realize it.
天机阁每次都在伴月楼举办竞拍大会，佳品众多但还是狼多肉少。不知我的积蓄够不够拍下一件……¤Heavens Secrets Pavilion helps holds auctions for their associate branch Moon House. There are many fine products but never enough to go around. I don't know if my savings are enough for me to get even a glance in...
那可是每次东石谷最值得期待的活动了。拍卖品皆是由天机阁精心挑选，总能让人眼界大开。¤That is the most anticipated event in East Stone Valley every time. The auction items are carefully selected by the Heavens Secrets Pavilion, and it is always eye-opening.
此谷东边那栋最高的木雕塔楼便是。听说打从有东石古盛会就存在了，百年过去依然崭新无恙，想来是有仙法护持吧。¤It's the tallest wood-carved tower on the east side of this valley. I hear immortals have gathered there since before the founding of the village. A hundred years have passed and it still looks brand new. I think it is protected by the magic of immortals.
你杀一儆百，那些原本虎视眈眈的修士也忌惮许多，不敢上前试探。¤If you kill it, the cultivators who originally looked at them are also very jealous, and they don't dare to come forward and try.
这是一个{$Var1}的洞窟，你虽然只是简单在洞窟内勘察了一番，但已经察觉到这里实际上是一处中等规模的矿脉。¤This is a cave of {$Var1}. Although you simply surveyed the cave, you have already noticed that it is actually a medium-sized vein.
必须在其它势力发现这处矿脉前，尽快将这个消息回禀宗门。¤The news must be reported to the sect as soon as possible before other forces discover this vein.
既然如此，我等便前往别处寻觅机缘了。¤In that case, we will go elsewhere to seek the opportunity.
回头看向幸存的三人——他们眉头紧皱、暗自神伤，即便刚捡回一条命，他们也半点都开心不起来。¤Looking back at the three survivors - they were frowning and darkly wounded, even though they had just recovered a life, they were half happy.
但若不如此做，我们连一丝重生的机会都没有。¤But if we don't do so, we won't even have a chance of rebirth.
前辈既然想要逆天造化术，又不自然地背着一把剑，其中联系大致便能猜到了。¤Since the seniors wanted to reverse the Heavenly Creation Technique and were unnaturally carrying a sword, the connection could be roughly guessed.
几千年下来，化神强者倒是遇见不少，可没有一个愿意在这三冥海飞升，我也拿不出什么东西与他们交易，便只得作罢。¤Thousands of years down the line, but met a lot of strong Deity Transformation cultivators, but none of them are willing to ascend in the Three Underworlds Sea, I can not get anything to trade with them, so I just have to stop.
道友，再会了。¤Fellow Daoist, goodbye.
建岛前的确如此。但在约莫万余年之前，幽冥海上便有一位化神巅峰强者渡劫。¤This was indeed the case before the island was built. But about 10,000 years ago, there was a peak Deity Transformation powerhouse on the Sea of the Underworld.
你知道我铁剑中藏有魂体？邀请我来此又有何目的？¤You know that I have a soul body hidden in my iron sword? And what was the purpose of inviting me here?
岛主最先回过神来，走上前向你作了一揖。¤The islander was the first to come back to his senses and walked up to you and made a bow.
就在几近丧失信心之时，我遇见了幽荧。¤Just when I was close to losing my confidence, I met Youfeng.
当然为了防备突发情况，我也留有后手，只不过…结局你也看到了。¤Of course, in case of unexpected circumstances, I also left a backhand, but... you saw the end.
…你们今后可有何打算？¤...What are your future plans?
哈哈哈，这岛主所说我本就没有报太大的期望，反倒是你这片心意让我很是感动。¤Hahahaha, I didn't expect much from what the island master said, but I was touched by your heart.
与其靠别人，不如指望你飞升来得实在。¤Instead of relying on others, it is better to count on your ascension to come true.
邀请前辈来此自然有平衡风险的考虑，但让每一位贡献突出之人都能重获新生，本身就是我最初的打算。¤Naturally there was a balancing of risks in inviting the seniors here, but it was in itself my original intention that everyone who had made an outstanding contribution would be given a new lease of life.
此等人物，你是如何信过她的？¤Such a character, how did you trust her?
你当初说这阴魂岛乃是自古以来便有的，现在看来恐怕所言非实吧？¤You said at the beginning that this Yin Soul Island is since the ancient times, now it seems that what is said is not true, right?
我？我还差得远呢。¤I? I'm not even close.
只可惜他最终渡劫失败，未能开启飞升通道。¤It's just a pity that he eventually failed to cross the tribulation and failed to open the ascension passage.
此番还是多亏了前辈，不然我等定会命丧于此。¤It was thanks to the seniors that we would have perished here.
虽然落差很大，不过最差也就是回到建岛之前的状态罢了。¤It was a big drop, but at worst, it was just a return to the state before the island was built.
这样，至少为岛上出过力的人能有机会重生。至于其他魂体，便只能怪他们出力不够了…¤This way, at least the people who have contributed to the island can have a chance to be reborn. As for the other souls, they can only be blamed for not contributing enough...
你已经超越了许多人，我对你可是很有信心的。¤You have surpassed many people, I have a lot of confidence in you.
你既然想要逆天造化术，又不自然地背着一把剑，其中联系大致便能猜到了。¤Since you want to reverse the Heavenly Creation Technique and unnaturally carry a sword, the connection can be roughly guessed.
于是，我想办法给她收集神阴石，她飞升时助我重生，我们便一拍即合、创立了这座阴魂岛。¤So, I found a way to collect divine Yin stones for her, and she helped me to be reborn when she ascended, so we hit it off and created this Yin Soul Island.
此番还是多亏了道友，不然我等定会命丧于此。¤This time or thanks to the daoist friends, or we will certainly die here.
客套话就不必多说了，此事的来龙去脉，岛主是否该交代一下了？¤The polite words do not need to say more, the context of this matter, the island master should not explain it?
道友有什么想知道的尽管问，在下一定知无不言。¤If you have anything you want to know, just ask, I'll tell you everything.
此前你不是说，化神强者都不愿意在三冥海飞升？¤You said earlier that no one strong enough to become a Deity Transformation was willing to ascend in the Three Underworlds Sea?
那便祝岛主好运了。¤Then I wish the island master good luck.
当时我拿着《逆天造化术》，在三冥海四处寻找有机会飞升之人。¤At that time, I took the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique and looked around the Three Underworld Seas for people who had a chance to ascend.
我是说…此次恐怕让你失望了…¤I mean...I'm afraid I've let you down this time...
你所说的幽荧究竟是何人？¤Who exactly is this Phantom Flux you speak of?
…但愿吧。¤...I hope so.
但此事却让我看见了一丝希望。想必只要足够耐心，总会有修士会选择在这三冥海飞升吧。¤But this matter has given me a glimmer of hope. I think if you are patient enough, there will always be cultivators who will choose to ascend in the Three Underworlds Sea, right?
我能有什么不好的？¤What's wrong with me?
其实她不止一种人格，我们相识之时，冷静与善良的人格才是主导。¤In fact, she has more than one personality, and when we met, the calm and kind personality was the dominant one.
便是刚才你击败之人。¤It is the person you defeated just now.
如此他们才有动力收集神阴石，借此也能吸引三冥海上的魂体来此。¤So that they have the motivation to collect the divine Yin stone, through which they can also attract the soul body of the Three Underworlds Sea to come here.
若按照当初的设想，我宣布一个贡献门槛，任何达到此门槛之人都能重获新生。¤If, as originally conceived, I declare a threshold of contribution, anyone who reaches this threshold can regain a new life.
那岛上的体系又当如何？你最开始说是为了互相帮助，现在看来，恐怕是一场骗局吧？¤What about the system on the island? You first said it was to help each other, but now it seems to be a scam, right?
邀请你来此自然有平衡风险的考虑，但让每一位贡献突出之人都能重获新生，本身就是我最初的打算。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a new life.
岛主一行人走后，你便开始沟通铁剑中的魏无极。¤After the island master and his group left, you began to communicate with Wei Wuji in the iron sword.
当时她恰巧在寻找飞升的办法，并且一定要在三冥海中飞升，只是需要大量的神阴石帮助。¤At that time she happened to be looking for a way to ascend and must ascend in the Three Underworlds Sea, just needing a lot of divine Yin stones to help.
前辈有什么想知道的尽管问，在下一定知无不言。¤If there is anything you want to know, just ask, I will tell you everything.
此间事了，你便继续踏上了旅程。¤After this matter was over, you continued on your journey.
当然为了防备突发情况，我也留有后手，只不过…结局前辈也看到了。¤Of course, in case of an unexpected situation, I have left a backhand, only... the ending elder also saw.
这阴魂岛乃是我与幽荧相识之后才创立的。¤This Yin Soul Island was created only after I met with the Phantom.
更何况，此前并非没有修士在三冥海渡劫。¤What's more, there are not no cultivators in the Three Underworlds Sea before the tribulation.
幽荧对神阴石的需求量极大，究竟要如何收集足够的神阴石？¤The demand for divine Yin stones is extremely high in Yuefeng, how exactly do I collect enough of them?
前辈，后会有期。¤I'll see you later, seniors.
除开此法能达到幽荧的需求，我想不到更好的方式。¤I can't think of a better way to do it, except for the fact that this method can reach the needs of the Phantom.
确实，按照那轩岚诺所说，这麒麟血一开始就是他主导的。¤Indeed, according to that Xuan Lanuo, this qilin blood was led by him from the beginning.
（是啊，他连诛仙剑都能先行搁置。）¤(Yes, he can even put aside the sword of the Immortal Punisher first.)
那我下去了，徒弟后面的交给你了。¤Then I'll go down and leave the back of the apprentice to you.
此次你孤身犯险，破坏了古神教的阴谋，这些都是我的收藏，你收下。¤This time you have gone alone and disrupted the plot of the Ancient God Cult. These are my collection, and you will receive them.
而且，更是他师傅所求。但最后他反倒是为了炼制炼妖散连那滴麒麟血都不要了。¤And, moreover, it was what his master had asked for. But in the end, he ended up not even wanting that drop of qilin blood in order to refine the Demon Refining Scatter.
不过，我更关心此人的师傅？钟师兄、麟尊前辈，你们有了解过玄骨的师傅么？¤However, I am more concerned about this person's master? Senior Brother Zhong and Senior Lin Zun, have you ever learned about Xuan Bone's master?
我去游历的时候也没听说过。¤I had never heard of it when I went on my travels either.
说不准下次见面这妖人就要是化神大能了。¤It is not possible to say that the next time we meet this demon will be a Deity Transformation Power.
接下来我会请人留心的。¤I will ask someone to keep an eye out for it next.
若那完整的炼妖散真有他所说的玄妙，这蜕凡化神的机会是比什么都重要。¤If the complete Demon Refining Pill is really as mysterious as he says, this chance to Deity Transformation is more important than anything else.
嗯...我也不甚了解，在此之前也没有流传过玄骨究竟是何师承。¤Well... I don't know much about it either, and there was no rumour before then as to what exactly Xuanbone's mastery was.
没想到玄骨此人倒是下了一盘大棋，所图不小嘛。¤I didn't expect Xuanbone to have played a big game, and his plans are not small.
傻鸟你想多了，蜕凡化神要是一剂外物就能成功，也不会有这仙凡之别了。¤Silly bird, you are thinking too much. If the Deity Transformation could be successful with a single dose of external substances, there would not be this difference between immortal and mortal.
你们回来的好快，那玄古门怎么了？¤You guys came back so fast, what happened to that Profound Ancient door?
此番巫山之行多谢{shidi}了，后面的由我来善后吧。¤Thanks to {shidi} for this trip to Wushan, I'll take care of the rest.
是我技不如人，要杀要剐随你们吧！¤It's because I'm not as good as people. If I want to kill, I have to follow you!
龙湛长老，我并非滥杀无辜之人，到此来只想得知龙族到底为何对百里家穷追不舍？¤Elder Long Zhan, I am not a murderer of innocent people. From now on, I just want to know why the Dragon Clan pursues Baili's family?
那人的声音几近癫狂。岛主原先欣喜的神情一扫而空，而他身边的魂体听到这话瞬间全都慌了神。¤The man's voice was almost maniacal. The island master's original delighted look was swept away, while the soul bodies around him all instantly panicked when they heard this.
我若不能飞升，你们的图谋岂不是也落空了？¤If I can't ascend, won't your plans also fall through?
你将信将疑地看着他们，静待事情的进展。¤You look at them in disbelief and wait for things to progress.
你抬头望向天空——那本应洁白如玉的月亮，竟被黑暗吞噬了一角。¤You look up at the sky - the moon, which should be as white as jade, is actually swallowed up by darkness in one corner.
这月蚀与你图谋之事究竟有何关联？那飞升之人又所在何处？¤What is the connection between this eclipse and what you are planning? And where is the ascended one?
她纵然一跃，跳入空间裂缝中，通道也随之消失，天空中只剩下他那张狂的笑声回荡。¤She leapt into the spatial rift, and the passage disappeared, leaving only his wild laughter echoing in the sky.
李司魂，再分一些给我。¤Li Si Soul, share some more with me.
（邪魅地）怎么会？不够，还差一点。¤(Evilly) How? Not enough, still a little short.
笑话，本座还用得着你们帮忙？¤Jokingly, does this seat need your help?
没时间了，快。¤There's no time, hurry.
一时间，岛上遍地哀嚎。只有岛主一行人得以幸免。¤For a while, the island wailed everywhere. Only the island master and his party were spared.
此言一出，魂体们金紧张的情绪有所缓和，你也趁此机会道出了自己的疑虑。¤Once this was said, the nervousness of the soul bodies eased, and you took this opportunity to voice your doubts.
呵呵，道友莫急，此人诸位马上就会见到了。¤Oh, Daoist friends, do not be anxious, this person you will soon meet.
吸收完魂体过后，她反手将阴气注入气旋中，形成了一个灰白色的巨型通道，直通天际。¤After absorbing the soul body over, she backhanded the Yin Qi into the cyclone, forming a giant gray-white channel that leads to the sky.
“竟是月蚀？不知道岛主究竟打的什么算盘…”¤It's a lunar eclipse? I do not know what the island master is playing...
李司魂并没有过多犹豫，一把将除开向之恒与无尘以外的魂体全部推出。那通道也离月亮更近了一分.。¤Li Si Soul did not hesitate too much, a handful of souls other than to the Heng and dustless all pushed out. That passage is also a minute closer to the moon .
尽管他们三人看上去实力不俗，但在这恐怖的吸力下却如风中的秋叶一般无力，顷刻间便被卷去。¤Although the three of them seemed to be strong, they were as powerless as autumn leaves in the wind under the terrifying suction, and were swept away in a moment.
除开给你的神阴石，你不是说一千魂体足矣？¤In addition to the divine Yin stone you were given, didn't you say that a thousand soul bodies were enough?
你将信将疑地退至一旁，静待事情的进展。¤You will faithfully retreat to the side and wait for things to progress.
由于是受到岛主的邀约，你径直向岛内飞了过去。¤Since you were invited by the island master, you flew straight towards the island.
岛主紧张中又略带兴奋的神情，让你感到一丝怪异。¤The island Lord's nervous and slightly excited look gives you a tinge of weirdness.
岛上一阵惊呼声传来，只见一道人影突兀地出现在半空——虽然能认出那是幽荧，但她的表情却与之前截然不同。¤A shout of alarm came from the island, only to see a figure suddenly appear in mid-air - although it could be recognized as Youxian, her expression was very different from before.
月亮已被吞噬了九成。听到这话，李司魂脸一沉，直接启动了脚下的阵法。¤The moon has been swallowed up ninety percent. Hearing this, Li Si soul face sank, directly activated the formation under the feet.
既然魏无极也被牵连其中，你自然不能坐视不理。¤Since Wei Wuji is also implicated in this, you naturally cannot sit back and watch.
见状，魂体们停止了议论，纷纷警惕着你的到来。¤Seeing this, the souls stopped talking and were alert for your arrival.
前辈莫要冲动，若我们不在了，前辈要如何独自战胜此人？¤Seniors should not be impulsive. If we are no longer here, how will seniors defeat this man alone?
我等只需在通道打开之时，运起逆天造化术即可。¤We just need to run the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique when the passage opens.
这一切发生的太快，让你来不及多想。¤It all happened so fast that you can't think much about it.
面对突然起来的异象，岛内的魂体们大多都惴惴不安。岛主一行人也聚在一处、小声地议论着。¤In the face of the sudden up vision, most of the souls on the island were anxious. The island master and his party also gathered in one place, whispering.
（邪魅地）敬酒不吃，就这破阵也想挡住我？¤(Evilly) Don't refuse my toast or you shall surely forfeit all, do you truly believe this broken little formation is able to stop me?
既然你从一开始便不在乎别人的死活，此刻下去陪他们，你应该也没有任何怨言吧？¤Since you don't care about other people's lives from the beginning, you shouldn't have any complaints if you go down to accompany them at this moment, right?
道友，如此下去，你铁剑中的魂体定然也无法逃脱。现在出手，我等还能掩护一二。¤Fellow Daoist, if this continues, the soul body in your iron sword will certainly not be able to escape either. Now strike, we can still cover one or two.
只见李司魂仰天长叹了一声，脸上尽是辛酸与无奈。¤I saw Li Si-Shen let out a long sigh, his face full of bitterness and helplessness.
想不到前辈已然突破化神修为，真当是可喜可贺！¤I can't believe that senior has already broken through the Deity Transformation level.
“这…难道岛主一开始便打算牺牲掉这些魂体？”¤This...could it be that the island master planned to sacrifice these soul bodies from the beginning?
你没有刻意收敛修为，岛主马上便察觉到了你的境界。¤You deliberately didn't suppress your cultivation, and the island master immediately sensed your realm.
（邪魅地）这种事情谁说得准？¤(Evilly) Who can say this kind of thing?
事态尚未明了，切勿高兴太早。¤Things are not yet clear, do not be too early to be happy.
如今给你的数目，可远远不止一千了。¤The number given to you today can be much more than a thousand.
言罢，他直接放弃了抵抗。剩下两人也没能支撑多久便也随之而去。整个阴魂岛上只剩下你们二人。¤After the words, he directly gave up the resistance. The remaining two also could not support for long and then also went with them. You two are the only ones left on the whole island.
一阵惊呼声传来，只见一道人影突兀地出现在半空——她通体漆黑，却是白发白眸，看上去甚是诡异。¤A cry of alarm came, only to see a figure suddenly appeared in mid-air - her body is pitch black, but white hair and white eyes, looks very strange.
说着，岛主又简要介绍起那些魂体为阴魂岛所作出的贡献。他紧张中又略带兴奋的神情，让你感到一丝怪异。¤The island master said, and then briefly introduced the contributions of those soul bodies for the Yin Soul Island. His nervous and slightly excited look makes you feel a touch odd.
任何人看到这空间裂缝恐怕都只会有逃跑的念头。所幸你相距甚远，这裂缝未能波及到你。¤Anyone who sees this spatial rift will only have the thought of running away. Fortunately, you are very far away, this crack can not affect you.
言罢，一股针对魂体的恐怖吸力瞬间爆开，李司魂脚下的阵法只抵抗了顷刻，便被损坏殆尽。¤After the words, a terrifying suction force against the soul body instantly burst open, Li Si soul feet of the formation only resisted for a moment, then was damaged.
（邪魅地）我来也！嘁嘁嘁嘁嘁嘁！！！¤(Evilly) I'm coming too! Chitty chitty chitty chitty chitty!!!
不错！看来她还是能信守承诺，我这阵法暂时是用不上了。¤Not bad! It seems that she can still keep her promise, I can't use this formation for the time being.
来不及了，快。¤It's too late, hurry.
道友莫要冲动，若我们不在了，你要如何独自战胜此人？¤Daoist friend do not be impulsive, if we are no longer there, how are you going to defeat this person alone?
诸位莫慌，这位道友也是对阴魂岛有功之人，来此的目的也与我们相同。¤All of you do not panic, this fellow Daoist is also to the Yin Soul Island meritorious people, come here for the same purpose as us.
前辈莫急，此人诸位马上就会见到了。¤Don't be anxious, you will see this person soon.
这已经是老夫的底线，你莫要欺人太甚。¤This is already the bottom line of the old man, you should not bully people too much.
“这便是月环蚀吧，果然如荧儿所说的一样。”¤This is the moon ring eclipse, right? It is just like what Fluorescence said.
此时，月亮已被黑影吞噬殆尽，只剩下最外层的银色圆环。就好像打开了一个通道，却不知通向何方。¤At this time, the moon has been swallowed up by the black shadow, leaving only the outermost silver circle. It was as if a passage had been opened, but I didn't know where it would lead.
岛主一向诡计多端，此言无非只是想利用你挡住那人罢了，你并没有理会他。¤The island master has always been tricky, and this comment was just to use you to block that person, and you didn't pay attention to him.
当时我们似乎不是这样约定的吧？¤It seems that we didn't agree on this at that time, right?
（邪魅地）嘁嘁嘁，要怪就怪你们的岛主吧。¤(Evilly) Ch-ch-ch-ch, blame it on your island master.
（邪魅地）还差一点，你将身边两人也推给我，快。¤(Evilly) is still a little short, you will push the two people around you to me as well, quickly.
…罢了，天要亡我。¤...just, the sky is going to kill me.
只见她一手划过天际，高空中随即被撕开了一道空间裂缝。其中中吐出一阵阵毁灭性极强的空间乱流，令人毛骨悚然。¤Only to see her hand across the sky, high in the sky was then torn open a spatial rift. In which spit out a burst of destructive extremely strong spatial turbulence, creepy.
不知是用了什么招式，只一挥手，气旋周围成百上千的魂体便被她尽数吸入体内，只有岛主一行人得以幸免。¤I don't know what kind of move she used, but with a wave of her hand, hundreds of souls around the cyclone were sucked into her body, and only the island master and his party were spared.
（邪魅地）嘁嘁嘁嘁！就是现在！我感受到了！¤(wickedly) Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch! It is now! I feel it!
见到你，岛主便立刻迎了上来。¤When he saw you, the island master immediately greeted you.
你能感受到这个阵法防御力之强大，只有玄武剑阵能与之比拟。¤You can feel the power of this formation defense, only Black Tortoise sword formation can be compared with it.
岛主，当年卖的关子，现在也该解释清楚了吧？¤Islander, the shutter you sold back then, it's time to explain clearly now, right?
为了这一刻，我们不知苦等了多少年。现在只需等她飞升成功，我等便可重获新生！¤For this moment, we don't know how many years we have waited so hard. Now just wait for her to ascend successfully, we can regain our lives!
不知是用了什么招式，只一挥手，气旋周围成百上千的魂体便被她尽数吸入体内。¤I don't know what move was used, only a wave of the hand, hundreds of souls around the cyclone will be sucked into her body by all.
阁下究竟有何神通，能如此张狂？便让在下领教一二吧。¤What is your power that you can be so arrogant? Let me learn a thing or two.
你与岛主一行人的关系也没有多深，此时自然是要保得自己周全。¤Your relationship with the island master and his party is not much deeper, at this time is naturally to protect their own safety.
阴魂岛上原本就阴郁的色调变得愈加昏暗，阴气也变得愈加浓郁。¤The original gloomy tones on the island of the Yin Soul became more and more dim, and the Yin Qi became more and more dense.
前辈，此时出手，我等尚可帮前辈一把，机不可失啊。¤elders, at this time, we can still help elders, the opportunity can not be lost ah.
片刻后，月亮已被吞噬过半，岛上的阴气已然开始有凝实的迹象。¤A few moments later, the moon had been swallowed up more than halfway, and the island's yin energy had begun to show signs of solidification.
你与岛主一行人并没有太多交情，便远远地站在了一旁，静待其中变化。¤You do not have much friendship with the island master and his party, so you stood far away and waited for the changes in it.
道友来的正是时候，这边请。¤Fellow Daoist has come at the right time, this way please.
于是，你趁着那人还未注意到你时扬长而去，此间的一切都与你再无瓜葛。¤So, you took advantage of that person before they noticed you and left, everything here is no longer related to you.
尽管他们三人看上去实力不俗，但在这恐怖的吸力下却如风中的秋叶一般飘摇，就连铁剑中的魏无极也未能幸免。¤Although the three of them seem to be not bad strength, but in this terrifying suction force but like the autumn leaves in the wind like fluttering, even Wei Wuji in the iron sword was not spared.
百年玄冰晶...此地的水灵气浓度确实很高。看来{$NpcName}所说不假，我得小心些妖王。¤Centennial mysterious ice crystal... The concentration of water aura here is indeed very high. It seems that what {$NpcName} said is true, I have to be careful with the demon king.
百年炎晶...此地的火灵气浓度确实很高。看来{$NpcName}所说不假，我得小心些妖王。¤Centennial Flame Crystal... The concentration of fire aura here is indeed very high. It seems that what {$NpcName} said is true, I have to be careful with the demon king.
槐魄石...此地的木灵气浓度确实很高。看来{$NpcName}所说不假，我得小心些妖王。¤Sophora stone... The concentration of wood aura here is indeed very high. It seems that what {$NpcName} said is true, I have to be careful with the demon king.
玄鑫石...此地的金灵气浓度确实很高。看来{$NpcName}所说不假，我得小心些妖王。¤Xuanxin Stone... The concentration of gold aura here is indeed very high. It seems that what {$NpcName} said is true, I have to be careful with the demon king.
百年岩玉髓...此地的土灵气浓度确实很高。看来{$NpcName}所说不假，我得小心些妖王。¤Centennial rock chalcedony... The concentration of earth aura here is indeed very high. It seems that what {$NpcName} said is true, I have to be careful with the demon king.
主药用的是{color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=939}{/color}，辅药为{color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=940}{/color}，至于药引则是{color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=941}{/color}，需得按{color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=942}{/color}的比例添加，方可炼制成功。¤The main medicine is {color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=939}{/color}, the auxiliary medicine is {color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=940}{/color}, and the drug introduction is {color=# d0380a}{SayStcVal=941}{/color}, it needs to be added in the proportion of {color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=942}{/color} in order to be successfully refined.
该到了向丹炉内添置辅药的时候了，你应该...？¤It's time to add adjuvants to the pill furnace, should you...?
索性这次最重要的丹药保住了，我也不与你多计较这些，回去好好反省吧。¤Simply this time the most important pill is saved. I don't care about it with you. Go back and reflect on it.
这主药本座已经添进丹炉，两日后先添入辅药，再过五日添入药引，如此炼制七七四十九日后，方可成丹，你可记下了？¤This main medicine has already been added to the pill furnace. Two days later, the auxiliary medicine will be added first, and then the medicine will be added in the next five days. After seven or forty-nine days of refining, the pill can be formed. Can you write it down?
你将{$fysl1}株{SayStcVal=940}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You put {$fysl1} strains {SayStcVal=940} into the furnace, and then continue to fan the fire without stopping...
炼丹是最忌讳寒热冲突，放错了药引就会导致废丹，我这一炉上好的丹药都毁在你手上了，你可有把我先前的嘱托放在心上？¤Alchemy is the most taboo cold and heat conflict. Misplacing the medicine will lead to abolishing the pill. My best pill is ruined in your hands. Have you taken my previous instructions to your heart?
你拿起扇子，站到丹炉边慢慢地扇了起来...¤You picked up the fan, stood by the Dan furnace and slowly fanned it...
看你对草药药性不甚了解。此物你就收下吧。¤I see you don't know much about herbal medicine. This is a good thing for you to take.
哼，现在倒是知道错了。¤Huh, I know it was wrong now.
你将{$dysl}株{$yaoying1}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You added {$dysl} strain {$yaoying1} into the furnace, and then kept fanning the fire without stopping...
你转身欲走，却听他叫住你，思索片刻从储物袋中取出一本书籍向你扔来。¤You turn to leave, but hear him call out to you, and after a moment's thought takes a book out of his storage pouch and throws it at you.
你将{$dysl1}株{SayStcVal=941}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You put {$dysl1} {SayStcVal=941} into the furnace, and then you continue to fan the fire without stopping...
好了，本座还有其他要务在身，就先走一步了。等时候到了，我自会回来验收。¤Okay, I have other important tasks, so I'll take a step forward. When the time comes, I will come back for acceptance.
你揭开丹炉，却只闻到一股难以形容的奇怪气味。由于数种药性的强烈冲突，丹药并没有被炼制成功，只结成了数颗布满裂纹的废丹。¤You opened the pill furnace, but only smelled an indescribable strange smell. Due to the strong conflict of several medicinal properties, the pill was not successfully refined, only a few cracked waste pills were formed.
你揭开丹炉，一部分过剩的药性在炉底结成了一层厚厚的药渣，好在还是成功的炼制出了{$dysl}颗通体浑圆的丹药。¤You opened the pill furnace, and part of the excess medicinal properties formed a thick layer of medicinal slag at the bottom of the furnace. Fortunately, {$dysl} whole-body pill was successfully refined.
那好，从今日起，就罚你在这炼丹房内看火三月，好好反省。¤Well, from today, I will punish you to watch the fire in this alchemy room for three months and reflect on it.
你来得正好，老夫正准备起炉炼丹，你且过来为老夫看着这炉火，不得有半点差池。¤You came just right, the old man is about to start the furnace to make alchemy. Come here and watch the fire for the old man, there must be no difference.
哎...过而不能知，是为不智。¤Hey... it is unwise to pass and not know.
弟子错了，还请长老责罚...¤The disciple is wrong, please elders to punish...
你揭开丹炉，隐约有一阵淡淡的药香飘过。可是丹药并没有被炼制成功，只在炉底形成了一层厚厚的药渣。¤You opened the pill furnace, and there was a faint fragrance of medicine passing by. But the pill was not successfully refined, only a thick layer of medicine slag formed at the bottom of the furnace.
你将{$dys2}株{SayStcVal=941}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You put {$dys2} {SayStcVal=941} into the furnace, and then you continue to fan the fire without stopping...
你将{$dysl}株{SayStcVal=941}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You put the {$dysl} strain {SayStcVal=941} into the furnace, and then continued to fan the fire without stopping...
接下来本座说的话你得好好记下，若是到时候弄错火候或者加错了药，把本座这炉丹炼废了，本座可是要罚你的。¤Next, you have to write down what this seat says. If you make the wrong heat or add the wrong medicine by that time, you will be abolished by the furnace pill of this seat, and you will be punished by this seat.
慢着。¤Slow down.
该到了向丹炉内添置药引的时候了，你应该...？¤It's time to add medicine to the pill furnace. Should you...?
你将{$fysl3}株{SayStcVal=940}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You put {$fysl3} strains {SayStcVal=940} into the furnace, and then continue to fan the fire without stopping...
哼，你可知自己错在何处？¤Hmph, do you know where you are wrong?
不错，不错...这几日辛苦师侄了。这颗化瘀丹就额外奖赏给你，回去好好休息吧。¤Yes, yes... You have worked hard for the past few days. I will give you a Novice Healing Pill as an extra reward. Go back and have a good rest.
你在炼丹房内扇了整整三个月的炉火，精疲力尽，但心境却得到了一些磨炼。{color=#d0380a}心境+1{/color}¤You fanned the fire in the alchemy room for three months, exhausted, but your mood was tempered. {color=#d0380a}Mentality+1{/color}
你将{$fysl2}株{SayStcVal=940}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You put {$fysl2} strains {SayStcVal=940} into the furnace, and then continue to fan the fire without stopping...
你将{$fysl1}株{$caoyao2}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You added {$fysl1} strains {$caoyao2} into the furnace, and then continued to fan the fire without stopping...
该到了向丹炉内添置{SayStcVal=940}的时候了，辅药的数量是...？¤It's time to add {SayStcVal=940} to the pill furnace. What is the number of adjuvants...?
焰火褪去，一阵浓郁的药香飘过，{$dysl}颗通体浑圆的丹药便光彩夺目的出现在了药鼎之内。¤The fireworks faded, and a strong fragrance of medicine drifted past, and the {$dysl} whole-round pill appeared dazzlingly in the medicine cauldron.
你将{$fysl1}株{$caoyao1}添入了丹炉之中，然后便马不停蹄地继续扇起了火来...¤You put {$fysl1} strains {$caoyao1} into the furnace, and then continue to fan the fire without stopping...
多...多谢前辈。¤Much...thank you senior.
你来到炉边，拿起风火扇慢慢地扇了起来...¤You come to the fire, pick up the wind and fire fan and slowly fan it...
该到了向丹炉内添置{SayStcVal=941}的时候了，药引的数量是...？¤It's time to add {SayStcVal=941} to the pill furnace. What is the number of Yaoying...?
这次本座要炼制的是{color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=938}{/color}，这一炉一共要炼制{color=#d0380a}{$dysl}{/color}颗。¤This time we are going to refine {color=#d0380a}{SayStcVal=938}{/color}, this furnace will need to refine {color=#d0380a}{$dysl}{/color}.
炼丹之时若是草药放错，轻则浪费材料，药性过剩产生多余无用的药渣，重则药性不足，无法成丹。¤If the herbal medicine is misplaced during alchemy, the materials will be wasted in the light of the time, the excess medicinal properties will produce unnecessary dregs, and the medicinal properties will be insufficient and the pill will not be formed in severe cases.
连最重要的辅药都会拿错，我这一炉上好的丹药都毁在你手上了，你可有把我先前的嘱托放在心上？¤Even the most important adjuvant will be wrong. My best medicine is ruined in your hands. Have you taken my previous advice to your heart?
谢长老。¤Thank you, Elder.
你来得正好，本座正在起炉，此番炼制丹药还得花费不少时日，你就待在这里，在本座回来前替本座看火添药。¤You are here just right, this seat is starting up, this time it will take a lot of time to refine the pill. You stay here, and you can add medicine to the fire before this seat comes back.
多谢你当日的那些话点醒了我，这份我自己研制的丹方还请{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}收下，作为谢礼，希望对道友能有所帮助。¤Thank you for those words you said that day that woke me up. I would like to ask {FirstName}{$TmpTalkString} to accept this recipe I developed myself as a thank you gift, and I hope it will be of help to you.
宗门大比后醒悟的我离开门派云游历练，如今总算小有所成。¤I woke up after the Sect Grand Competition, and I left the school to travel and practice, and now I have finally made a small difference.
咦？{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}？¤Huh? {FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}?
{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}还有什么事么？¤{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}, what else do you need?
徐道友可唤我{FirstName}{LastName}。¤Friend Xu Dao can call me {FirstName}{LastName}.
原来是徐凡师弟，看来你已经找回了自己的道。¤It turned out to be Junior Brother Xu Fan. It seems that you have recovered your way.
正是。当初或许是我过于故步自封，忘记了本应走的路。¤Exactly. Maybe I was too complacent and forgot the way I was supposed to go.
或许是我过于故步自封，忘记了本应走的路。¤Perhaps I was too complacent and forgot the way I was supposed to go.
在丹药的辅助下我也已经突破了筑基，同青嫣的关系也有所缓和。¤With the aid of the pill, I have also broken through the foundation building, and the relationship with Qing Yan has also eased.
原来是徐凡师兄，师兄看来已经找回了自己的道？¤It turned out to be Senior Brother Xu Fan. It seems that Senior Brother has recovered his way?
{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}，昔日一番话令在下受益匪浅。¤{FirstName}{$TmpTalkString}, I have benefited from the words of yesteryear.
闭关几日后我终于找回了仙途伊始时的信念，离开门派云游历练，如今总算小有所成。¤After a few days of retreat, I finally regained my belief in the beginning of Xiantu. I left the school to travel and practice, and now I have finally achieved something small.
咦？你是先前在连石山......¤Huh? You were in Lianshishan before...
这三把都是外门弟子可以领取的符器，{shidi}可以随意挑选一把。¤These three are all talisman artifacts that outer disciples can receive, {shidi} can choose one at will.
哈哈哈，没想到终于又有人能通过外门守擂的挑战了，不容易。¤Hahaha, I didn't expect that someone could finally pass the challenge of the outer gate. It is not easy.
这是门派弟子法袍，{shidi}收好。¤This is the cultivator disciple robe, {shidi} put it away.
我想想办法看能不能把这东西拼起来，日后再来找{xiongdi}！¤I want to find a way to see if I can put this thing together, and come back to {xiongdi} in the future!
我在玄微剑仙的房间找到了这个，但已经碎掉了，不知道有什么用。¤I found this in Xuanwei Jianxian's room, but it's broken and I don't know what's the use.
灭了我{$shili}对前辈也没什么实质性的好处，不如我{$shili}将门派收藏的所有秘传神通及功法全数交于前辈一观。¤Destroying me {$shili} would not be of any substantial benefit to seniors, so why don't I {$shili} hand over all the secret divine abilities and techniques collected by the sect to seniors for a look.
本是他出言请求你停下毁灭的脚步，说到一半后，自己却也是陷入沉默之中。¤It was he who spoke out to ask you to stop the destruction, and then, halfway through, fell into silence himself.
但前辈若是愿意放{$shili}一条生路，秘籍自会双手奉上。至于方才被打伤的长老等，我{$shili}绝不会有半点怨言。¤But if senior is willing to let {$shili} live, the secret book will be offered with both hands. As for the elders and others who were injured in the party, I {$shili} will never have any half-hearted complaints.
前辈有所不知，我{$shili}曾经也是有多位化神前辈，只是有些已然飞升，剩余的也不在世间。其中多位前辈都曾在藏经阁留下禁制，¤I {$shili} once had a number of Deity Transformation predecessors, but some of them had already ascended and the remaining ones were not in the world. The remaining ones are not in the world. Many of these seniors have left forbidden systems in the Book Depository.
且慢！请听我一言！¤Hold on! Please listen to me!
不如，我{$shili}将门派所有秘传神通及功法交与道友...而且方才的战斗中我派未曾有修士被击杀...若是道友就此罢手，{$shili}绝无半点怨言。¤Why don't I {$shili} hand over all the secret divine abilities and techniques of the sect to you... And in the battle just now, no cultivator of my sect was killed... If you stop here, {$shili} will have no complaints.
也不知是为战死的元婴长老而流，还是...为传承已久的门派在自己手上逐渐式微而流。¤I don't know whether it is flowing for the firstborn elders who died in battle, or... I don't know whether it is for the long-established sects that have gradually declined in their own hands.
直到你开始不耐烦时，他才支吾着将后半句话说出口。¤It is only when you start to get impatient that he stammers out the second half of the sentence.
这{$shili}掌门不再言语，只是吩咐了一个弟子为你带路。而后便如驼背石人一般静止在广场上，倒是脸颊旁有两行清泪缓步而下。¤This {$shili} palace no longer speaks, only instructed a disciple to lead the way for you. And then it was as still as a hunchbacked stone man in the square, but instead there were two lines of tears slowly stepping down beside his cheeks.
这{$shili}掌门见你同意，也不再废话，赶忙在前为你引路。¤Seeing that you agree, this {$shili} palmist sees no more nonsense and rushes ahead to lead the way for you.
前辈且慢！请听我一言！¤Wait, senior! Please listen to me!
灭杀了你们，这些秘籍自然也是落于我手。¤If I kill you, these secret books will naturally fall into my hands.
以道友的实力，灭了我{$shili}也没什么实质性的好处，不如...¤With your strength, there is nothing substantial to gain from exterminating me {$shili}, why don't you...
若是前辈执意要赶尽杀绝，那我也只好引动禁制毁去这些秘籍了。¤If senior insists on killing them all, then I will have no choice but to invoke the ban to destroy these secret books.
最近这几届猎魔试炼都有不少人死在了其中，虽说死伤在所难免，却总让我感到有一些不安。¤A lot of people have died in these recent demon hunting trials. Although death and injury are inevitable, it always makes me feel a little uneasy.
当年青蛇还在炼气期时一次便闯通了我派的幻雾阵，那时便能看出他的不凡。¤Back then, Azure Snake in Qi Condensation was able to break through our sect's Mirage Mist Array in a single try. I knew at once that he would be extraordinary.
没准是什么稀有古代的遗物，先拿着罢...¤Maybe it's some rare ancient relic, take it first...
不远处是一座火山，不过其四周已然是郁郁葱葱，一片生机盎然的景象，想必已经很久没有爆发过了。¤There is a volcano not far away, but it is already surrounded by lush greenery, a scene full of vitality, presumably it has not erupted for a long time.
见此美景，你的脚步不由得慢了下来。四处打量下，你发现脚边的草丛里有一块黑的深邃的石碑。清理过后，只见石碑上刻满了你不认识的字。¤Seeing this beautiful scenery, your footsteps could not help slowing down. Looking around, you found a dark and deep stone tablet in the grass beside your feet. After cleaning, I saw that the stone tablet is full of words you don't know.
看样子又是什么古代的遗物，拿去给采筠阁那些修士鉴定一番好了...¤It looks like some ancient relic, take it to the cultivators in Caiyun Pavilion for identification...
一阵妖风吹来...¤A demon wind blows...
小心，此地妖气甚重，看来这里的妖兽已有{color=#d0380a}筑基期{/color}实力，以你现在的修为怕是难以应对。¤Be careful, this place is very demon-like. It seems that the Spirit Beasts here have {color=#d0380a} base-building stage{/color} strength. With your current cultivation base, it may be difficult to deal with.
嗯，这{SayStcVal=929}果然在这里。¤Well, this {SayStcVal=929} is really here.
没准上面记录着什么重要的东西，拿去给采筠阁那些修士鉴定一番好了...¤Maybe there is something important recorded on it, take it to the cultivators of Caiyun Pavilion for identification...
山路走到一处转角，你赫然发现不远处的草丛中好似有一只旋龟。你下意识地拿出了武器，但随即便发现，那里没有丝毫灵气，只是一只沧桑的旋龟壳罢了。¤When the mountain road comes to a corner, you find that there seems to be a tortoise in the grass not far away. You subconsciously took out the weapon, but then found that there was no spiritual energy there, just a vicissitudes of life tortoise shell.
没准上面记录着什么重要的东西，先拿着罢...¤Maybe there is something important recorded on it, take it first...
那龟壳上藤曼繁茂，只能隐隐约约看见上面有人工的痕迹。待你将藤曼清理干净，只见龟壳上刻着一些你不认识的图案。¤The vines were lush on the tortoise shell, and there were only faint traces of man-made on it. After you clean up the Tengman, you will see some patterns you don't recognize on the tortoise shell.
那并不是宁州修士所擅长的符箓，我也只是听个名号罢了。¤That's not the talisman that the Ning Province cultivators are good at, I just listen to a name.
不知那化尘教的弟子缘何会使用这种符箓...你将此事默默记在心里。¤I don't know why the disciple of the Aeonic Sands Temple uses this kind of talisman...you silently keep this in your heart.
算你这{xiaozi}有点本事，下次见面你可就没这么走运了！¤If you {xiaozi} are a bit capable, you won't be so lucky next time you meet!
那血煞符以人血为引，是{color=#d0380a}魔门常用{/color}的一种符箓。¤That Bloodbath Talisman uses human blood as a guide and is a common {color=#d0380a} talisman used by the {/color} demon clan.
奇怪...难不成这魔修和化尘教有什么关联？对了老头儿，方才你说的血煞符又是什么东西？¤Strange...Could it be that this evil cultivator has something to do with Huachen Cult? By the way, old man, what is the blood evil talisman you just mentioned?
那魔修化作一道血光倏尔远去，你虽有心追击却也跟不上他的速度。前方的化尘教修士早已不见，而那些散布在路周围的符箓也化为碎屑，融入在沙土中了。¤The evil cultivator turned into a bloody light and went away. Although you were determined to pursue it, you couldn't keep up with his speed. The cultivator of the dust cultivator in front has long been gone, and the runes scattered around the road have also turned into debris. Melted into the sand.
听见他的威胁，你顿感为免日后生事，此人决不可留，倒不如一剑结果了他。¤Hearing his threat, you suddenly feel that this person must not stay in order to avoid trouble in the future, it is better to kill him with one strike.
禾山道...无碍，我方入仙门时倒是常与他们打交道。¤Heshan Road...no problem, we often deal with them when we enter the immortal gate.
小的有眼不识泰山！求仙师饶了小的吧！小的这就把阮五娘请来！¤The little one has eyes but doesn't know Mount Tai! Please forgive the little one! The little one will invite Ruan Wuniang!
只有岱舆山上的住民才知道前往岱舆山的方法，虽然我也曾住于山上，但决定追随阿山来到永安镇时，阿爹与阿娘便将关于道路的记忆从我的识海中抹去了。并非不愿告知前辈，我实在是记不得如何回去。¤Only the residents of Mount Daiyu know how to get to Mount Daiyu. Although I have lived on the mountain, but when I decided to follow Ah Shan to Yong'an Town, A-Da and A-Niang took the memory of the road from my sea of ​​knowledge. It's erased. It's not that I don't want to tell seniors, I really can't remember how to go back.
前辈不知，这毕钟天的父亲已筑基多年，在禾山道也有一席之地，将他除掉恐怕会惹来不小的麻烦。¤Senior doesn't know that Bi Zhongtian's father has built the foundation for many years, and he also has a place in Heshan Road. I am afraid that getting rid of him will cause a lot of trouble.
阿三见你心生杀意，刚想出口阻拦，未料剑影横飞，眨眼间那毕钟天便没了生气。¤Asan saw that you had a killing intent, and just wanted to stop by your exit, unexpectedly the sword shadow flew across, and in the blink of an eye, Bi Zhongtian was no longer angry.
你三下五除二就解决了毕钟天，他这才知道自己踢到了铁板，面色一白急忙向你告罪。¤You solved Bi Zhongtian by three times and five by two. Then he knew that he had kicked the iron plate, and his face turned pale and rushed to guilty.
阮娘！¤Niang Ruan!
阮娘，快见过前辈，多亏了他我才能这么快就将你救出来。¤Niang Ruan, I have met senior soon, thanks to him I can rescue you so quickly.
你这{xiaozi}竟敢伤我！我定要叫我爹给我讨回公道！¤You {xiaozi} dare to hurt me! I must ask my dad to get me justice!
你祭出飞剑，一剑刺穿了毕钟天的小腿，他见退路已断，情急之下一时凶相毕露。¤You sacrificed a flying sword, and a sword pierced Bi Zhongtian's calf. Seeing that his retreat had been broken, he showed his ferocity for a while.
棠阿三急急迎上前，两人执手相看泪眼。你略感尴尬，不禁别过头去，正巧瞥见一旁鬼鬼祟祟想要逃跑的毕钟天。¤Tang Asan eagerly greeted him, and the two held hands to look at their tears. Feeling a little embarrassed, you couldn't help turning your head away, and happened to catch a glimpse of Bi Zhongtian, who was sneaking in and trying to escape.
多谢前辈救命之恩，阮娘无以为报，不如便将这匹织好的霁光锦赠与前辈吧。¤Thank you predecessor for your life-saving grace, Niang Ruan has nothing to do with it, so let's give this woven Jiguang brocade to predecessor.
这匹锦缎于我并无用处，此次我本前来打听岱舆山的消息，不知五娘知道多少？¤This brocade is useless to me. This time I came to inquire about Dai Yushan, but I don't know how much Wu Niang knows?
我幼时曾见过这种灵药，天蝉灵叶生长条件苛刻，只有山脚的玉梁桥旁才偶尔得见。虽无法回到岱舆山，但前辈若是想采得此药的话我可以尝试呼唤族人。¤I have seen this kind of spirit herb when I was young. The growth conditions of the Skyscada Leaf are very unique, and I only see it occasionally by the Yuliang Bridge at the foot of the mountain. Although I can't return to Daiyu Mountain, if senior needs this herb, I can try to summon my tribe.
往哪逃！¤Where to flee!
他连忙朝屋内的仓库跑去，不须多时便带出来一位衣冠楚楚的女子。¤He hurried to the warehouse inside the house and brought out a well-dressed woman in no time.
“看来只能寄希望于阮五娘的族人了......”¤It seems that I can only pin my hopes on the people of Ruan Wuniang...
商讨了一番后，你决定先暂住在永安镇内，等候阮五娘与族人取得联络。¤After some discussions, you decide to live in Yong'an Town temporarily, waiting for Ruan Wuniang to get in touch with the tribe.
原来如此，当年许多人想查出鲛人一族的驻地好将其一网打尽，役使其生产鲛纱，却始终不得其道。没想到离山的鲛人会被抹除记忆，连他们都无法回到自己的故乡，何谈修士了。¤It turns out that, back then, many people wanted to find out where the shark clan resided so that they could be wiped out to make them produce shark yarn, but they were never able to do so. Unexpectedly, the sharks from the mountain would have their memories erased, and even they would not be able to return. How can I talk about cultivators in my hometown.
等...¤Wait...
前辈有什么想问的，我必知无不言，言无不尽。¤Senior has anything I want to ask, I must know everything, and I can't say enough.
阮五娘面有难色地向棠阿三看去，后者微笑着向她点了点头，她才犹豫着开口。¤Ruan Wuniang looked at Tang Asan with a dilemma, and the latter nodded to her with a smile, before she hesitated to speak.
看来你在宁王府过这几日竟是把脑子也懒散净了，居然带着尾巴来见我。¤It seems that you spent the past few days in Prince Ning's Mansion, and you have completely slackened your mind and came to see me with your tail.
好了，看在你帮我钓到一条大鱼的份上，奉劝你一句，宁王府乃是非之地，不可久留。¤Well, because you helped me catch a big fish, I would like to advise you that Prince Ning's Mansion is a place of right and wrong, and you should not stay for a long time.
这是本能够增加你未来结丹成功率的秘术，在这市面上可是极难寻得。¤This is a secret technique that could increase your success rate of alchemy in the future, but it is extremely difficult to find in this market.
{xiaozi}想用这种下三滥伎俩糊弄我，门儿都没有！¤{xiaozi} wants to fool me with this kind of indiscriminate trick, there is no way!
这乌靴是少见的鞋类法器，穿上后身轻如燕，遁速会快上不少。¤These black boots are a rare tool of footwear. Wearing them on the back is as light as a swallow, the escape speed will increase a lot.
你收敛笑意，谢过他救命之恩。白袍修士应允几声，提起之前许诺你的酬劳。¤You suppressed your smile and thanked him for his life-saving grace. The white-robed cultivator agreed several times and mentioned the rewards he had promised you before.
这里便是与宗门长老约定的地点吧？¤This is the location agreed with the elder of the sect, right?
看时间，长老应该已经到了啊...¤Looking at the time, the elder should have arrived...
你很想他活？¤Do you want him to live?
这几颗补灵丹是少见的四品丹药，遇到危险时服下，或许能救你一命。¤These Qi Caller Pills are rare fourth-tier pills. Taking them when you are in danger, they may save your life.
都说了让你小心身后的嘛，不要以为自己年纪大就做什么都有道理，人生按常理出牌怎么还会叫人生呢？¤I said it makes you beware of those behind you. Don't think that it makes sense to do what you do when you are old. How can life be called life according to common sense?
获得片刻喘息时间的你调整状态，重新与他周旋。几招过后你仍落于下风，就在此时你放声高呼：¤You have gained a moment of breathing time to adjust your state and deal with him again. After a few moves, you are still at a disadvantage, and at this moment you shouted:
你听得心惊胆寒，正欲逃跑，却发现一只鬼手已经直奔门面而来。¤You were terrified at hearing, and you were about to run away, only to find that a ghost hand had come straight to the front.
紧急关头你扯碎卷轴，纸张断裂后绽出一道无比明亮的白光，朝那老人袭去！¤In an emergency, you shred the scroll, and after the paper broke, a bright white light appeared and struck the old man!
说时迟那时快一道凌厉剑气破空而来，将他捅了个对穿。¤Said Shi Chi, then, a sharp Sword Qi burst through the air and stabbed him in the opposite direction.
难道当年的墨居仁也是...不知除此人外是否还有魔修卧底，看来回去后有得忙了。¤Could it be that the same Mo Juren back then... I don't know if there still more evil cultivator undercover, it seems that I will be busy after returning.
抱歉，我还有些要事与宗门内部商议，怕是无暇顾及道友。¤Sorry, I still have some important matters to discuss with the sect, I am afraid that I will not have time to take care of the daoists.
听说前阵飞流真人乘着一艘六阶灵舟出海了，那灵舟通体碧绿，光华四散，连桅杆上都刻着阵法，真是叫人眼馋得紧......¤I heard that the Lord Feiliu went out to sea in a Tier 6 spirit boat. The spirit boat was green and scattered, and even the mast was engraved with formations. It was really eye-catching...
至于你...我并非没有给过你机会。你修为的确不俗，但演技却很拙劣。¤As for you... It's not that I haven't given you a chance. Your cultivation is indeed not bad, but your acting skills are clumsy.
想留下我，还得看你们有没有那个本事。¤If you want to keep me, you will have to see if you have the ability to do so.
你扭头看去，却发现不仅仅是公孙季，与他一同前来的，有两名公孙家的长老，还有那名风雨楼中的神秘少女...¤You turn your head to look, only to find that it's not just Gongsun Ji, with him come two elders of the Gongsun family, and that mysterious young girl from the Storm Tower...
说到这里，他脸上青筋凸起，气势也倏然暴增，令你不由得大感诧异。¤At this point, his face bulges with veins and his aura abruptly increases, much to your surprise.
他忽尔惨然一笑...¤He suddenly smiled miserably...
正当你暗自戒备之时，远处却传来一个熟悉的声音。¤Just as you are secretly on guard, a familiar voice comes from the distance.
当年他带你一起去追杀血剑宫，也只不过是想考验你的能力而已。¤Back then, when he brought you along to hunt down the Blood Sword Palace, he was merely trying to test your abilities.
那血剑宫的长老至少与你是合作关系，你却能下此狠手？¤That Elder of the Blood Sword Palace is at least in partnership with you, yet you can do such a cruel thing?
风雨楼最大的底牌不是像你这样的天字杀手，而是从幼年便开始培养的死士。¤The biggest card of the Wind and Rain House is not the Heavenly Assassins like you, but the dead soldiers who have been cultivated since their early childhood.
待我不薄？我们这些死士不过是你们公孙家培养的棋子罢了。¤Treat me well? We dead soldiers are nothing more than pawns trained by your Gongsun family.
琚长老，你本不必如此...当年公孙璞爷爷本就在考虑将长老之位传于你了。¤Elder Ju, you didn't have to do this... Back then, Grandpa Gongsun Pu was already considering passing on the position of Elder to you.
老祖当年待你不薄，若非他的提拔，哪有你琚运琦的今日？¤If it wasn't for his promotion, you wouldn't be where you are today, Ju Yunqi.
只有我，活了下来！¤Only I, survived!
公孙季...玄女？¤Gongsun Ji... Xuan Nui?
他知道的太多了...若他离开宁州也就罢了，但他却偏偏对白帝收藏的那柄戮仙剑感兴趣，那就由不得我对他动杀心了。¤He knows too much... If he had left Ning Province, it would have been fine, but he is interested in the Immortal Executing Sword that the White Emperor has in his collection, so I can't help but kill him.
亏损寿元，修炼而来的风雨楼秘术，让他们的实力突飞猛进，甚至能够跨越不同境界间的实力鸿沟，击败目标。¤The secret techniques of the Storm Tower, which they have cultivated through the loss of their life span, have allowed their strength to soar and they are even able to cross the strength gap between realms and defeat their targets.
你...你却与那血剑宫勾结...若...若非今日亲眼所见...¤You... But you colluded with the Blood Sword Palace... If... If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes today...
事已至此，我也不会束手就擒的。¤It's done, and I'm not going to take it lying down.
{$daihao}...没想到你这么强。¤{$daihao}... I didn't expect you to be so strong.
琚长老，那天魔解体大法每用一次，至少要损耗六七十年寿元，我劝你还是不要再用的好。¤Elder Ju, every time you use the Heavenly Demon Disintegration Technique, you will lose at least 60 to 70 years of life, so I advise you not to use it again.
若不是我坐上了这风雨楼大长老的位置，何来的资源弥补我亏空的寿元？¤If I hadn't taken the position of Grand Elder of this Rain or Shine House, where would the resources come from to make up for my deficit in longevity?
不过我倒是要谢谢你，帮我除掉了赤目这个累赘。¤But I do thank you for helping me to get rid of Akame as a liability.
哦？莫非你以为能赢得了我？¤Oh? Do you think you can win against me?
当年与我同辈进入风雨楼之人，早已死伤殆尽...¤Those of my generation who entered the Storm Tower back then have long since been killed or injured...
就这么点灵石？你打发叫花子呢？¤That's just a little bit of spirit stone? Are you sending a beggar?
站住，老子允许你从这儿过了么？¤Stop, did I allow you to pass here?
站...站...站住，打劫！¤Stop...Stop...Stop, rob!
又是沂山派的修士，我该怎么办呢...¤It's a cultivator from Yishan School again, what should I do...
就这么点儿？算了，今天就先放你一马，滚吧！¤That's it? Forget it, let you go first today and get out of here!
看什么看，没见过打劫的？把身上值钱的东西都交出来，大爷我就放你一马¤What are you looking at, I haven't seen a robbery? Hand over all the valuable things on your body, uncle, I will let you go.
那就要看你有没有这个本事了！¤Then it depends on whether you have this ability!
凭借记忆你来到正殿，只见那岛主连盛平端坐太师椅上，似乎早已感应到你的前来。¤With your memory, you came to the main hall, and saw the island owner Lian Shengping sitting on the chair of the grandmaster, and it seemed that he had already sensed your coming.
小友倒是有几分自知之明，自从你踏上千流岛的那刻起，你的命我便势在必得！¤My little friend is quite self-aware, since the moment you set foot on Qianliu Island, I will definitely win your life!
岛主在此等候，想必不是为了欢迎我吧？¤The owner of the island is waiting here, presumably not to welcome me?
别来无恙，{FirstName}{LastName}小友。¤Don't come here without problems, {FirstName}{LastName} boy.
不过下一次若是你被苗矮或是栖云发现了，可就没有我这么好说话了。¤But next time if you are discovered by Miaoai or Qiyun, they will not be as nice as I am..
栖云和苗矮平日里说话做事都颇为谨慎，这次也是打着巩固林家与星宫关系的名号，于情于理我都没有立场反对。¤Qiyun and Miao Ai are very cautious in speaking and doing things on weekdays. This time it is also in the name of consolidating the relationship between the Lin family and the Xinggong. I have no objection to it because of reason.
多谢小友将心儿带回，这府中有什么不明白的可以找我解惑。{w}{w=0.5}¤Thank you, little friend, for bringing Xin'er back. If there is anything you don't understand in this mansion, you can ask me to clarify.{w}{w=0.5}
天星双尊是大名鼎鼎的散修夫妻，星辰尊者与广微仙子二人皆是化神期修为，这点世人皆知。¤Heavenly Star Dual is a well-known independent cultivator couple. Everyone knows that both Venerable Xingchen and Fairy Guangwei are at the stage of Deity Transformation.
那天在长老堂外的果然是你...林沐心那丫头派你来的吧？¤It was you who was outside the elder's hall that day...Is that girl Lin Muxin sent you?
通羽长老默不作声，只是意味深长地看着你。¤Elder Tong Yu was silent, but looked at you meaningfully.
既然你有意帮助心儿调查此事，那我便给你一个机会。你们在府内行事我会想办法照应，至于能查出什么来，就看你们自己的了。¤Since you intend to help Xin'er investigate this matter, then I will give you a chance. I will find a way to take care of what you do in the mansion. As for what you can find out, it's up to you.
唉，这丫头从小就不教人省心。若不是我暗中用神识护着你，凭你这点微末道行，还做不到在我们林府来去自如。¤Hey, this girl has never taught people to worry about it since she was a child. If I hadn't secretly protected you with divine consciousness, with your meager things, I would not be able to come and go freely in our Lin Mansion.
心儿生性率直，望小友多担待。¤Xin'er is straightforward by nature, and I hope my little friends will take more care.
心儿不知跑哪去了，要是让二长老知道，又该责骂她了...¤I don't know where Xin'er has gone, if the second elder knows, and should scold her...
大长老心里是不是也对二长老和三长老有所怀疑？¤Does the Grand Elder also have doubts about the second elder and the third elder in his heart?
但很少有人知道，广微仙子实则是我林家老祖。千余年前老祖与星辰前辈结为道侣，而后才有了星宫与这天星城。¤But few people know that Fairy Guangwei is actually the ancestor of my Lin family. The ancestor formed a Taoist couple with Senior Stars more than a thousand years ago, and only then did the Star Palace and this Star City come into existence.
你不必害怕，我既然没有当场揭穿你，自然不打算在这件事情上责怪你和心儿。¤You don't have to be afraid. Since I didn't expose you on the spot, I naturally don't intend to blame you and Xiner for this matter.
{xiaozi}，小心！！¤{xiaozi}, be careful!!
正午，一位鹤发老者蓦地出现在会场上空。¤At noon, a crane-haired old man suddenly appeared in the sky above the venue.
他的声音并不洪亮，但却能让每个人都听的一清二楚、心情舒畅。¤His voice was not loud, but it was clear and soothing for everyone to hear.
比赛当天，你被安排坐在广场的一角，身边皆是一些炼气、筑基期的修士。¤On the day of the competition, you were arranged to sit in a corner of the square, surrounded by some Qi refining and foundation stage cultivators.
不久，大比便拉开了序幕，一场场比试在你笼罩的神识内打响。¤Soon, the big game kicked off, a competition in your Shielded divine consciousness to play.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，下次有事再喊你出来！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, I'll call you out next time something comes up!
虽然并没有深入钻研，但你也能看出不少门道来。¤Although it does not delve deeper, but you can also see a lot of doorways to.
之后，抽签、检验、入场、交手。每个环节都在天机阁的安排下有序地进行着。¤After that, draw lots, test, enter, and fight. Every part of the process was carried out in an orderly manner under the arrangement of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
哈哈哈哈哈，既然前十名已决出，这天机榜自然也要易位了。¤The top ten have already been decided, so naturally, the Heaven's Opportunity List will also change places.
相互道别后，你们便各自踏上了新的旅程。¤After saying goodbye to each other, you each embarked on a new journey.
那便约好了，一百年以后……实在不行就两百年以后，等我们都结丹了，再来这里过过招，到时候说不定还能碰上~¤Then make an appointment, a hundred years later ...... really can not be two hundred years later, when we have formed dan, and then come here to have a fight, then maybe we can also meet ~
我宣布，本届天机大比正式开赛！¤I declare that this year's Tian Ji Grand Competition is officially opened!
你能感受到，无论什么境界的修士都在低声议论你的名号，纷纷投来了尊敬的目光。¤You can feel, no matter what realm of cultivators are whispering your name, have cast a respectful gaze.
你一开始还略有些不好意思，但精彩的比试很快便让你将这些抛诸脑后。你没注意到的是，有不少炼气期的修士看到你们的行径，也纷纷效仿，大会顿时乱了起来，也热闹了起来。¤You were slightly embarrassed at first, but the exciting competition soon made you put that behind you. What you didn't notice is that a number of Qi refining stage cultivators saw your deeds and followed suit, and the conference was suddenly chaotic and lively.
嗯，回见。¤Well, see you later.
首先，大会将严格按照规则进行，禁止一切武器、法宝、防具的使用，并且禁止服用丹药，想必大家已经清楚了。¤First of all, the conference will be conducted in strict accordance with the rules, prohibiting all weapons, magic treasures, defensive gear, and prohibit the use of Pills, I think you are already clear.
再见啦。¤I'll see you later.
你与倪旭欣便早早的就落座其中。¤You and Ni XuXin then settled in it early.
说罢，倪旭欣便一人向临近的擂台跑去了，丝毫没有在意旁人的目光。¤Said, Ni XuXin then one person to the adjacent ring ran away, did not care about the gaze of bystanders.
我也得赶紧回去悄悄把令牌还回去了，要是让我爹发现了，又得挨通骂。¤I also have to hurry back to quietly return the token, if my father found out, and have to be scolded.
那…我自己去看吧，我们到时候见。¤Then...I'll go see for myself, I'll see you then.
尽管每一场比试都有其独到之处，但若想深入钻研某一道，还是着重观战几位修士为好。你决定¤Although each competition has its unique features, but if you want to delve deeper into a certain way, it is better to focus on watching a few cultivators. You decide
几天下来，你对此道的思绪多了不少。¤A few days down the road, you have a lot more thoughts on this path.
随着最后一场比试结束，决出了最终的冠军，大会也在众人潮水般的喝彩声中，接近了尾声。¤With the final competition over and the final champion decided, the conference draws to a close with a tidal wave of applause from the crowd.
大会结束后，你便带着思绪，混在熙熙攘攘的人群中离开会场。¤After the conference was over, you left the venue with your thoughts, mixed in the bustling crowd.
……嗯。¤...... Well.
在众目睽睽之下，他拉着你从一个擂台跑到另一个擂台，丝毫不在意旁人的目光。¤In full view of everyone, he pulls you from ring to ring, not caring about the gaze of onlookers.
此人……恐怕已是元婴巅峰修为，不愧是天机阁。¤This person ...... is afraid that it is already the peak cultivation of the YuanYing, worthy of the Tian JiGe.
嗯，若是真突破到了金丹期，来切磋一二也未尝不可。¤Well, if you really break through to the Golden Dan stage, it's not a bad idea to come to a sparring session.
此外，观战捧场的道友们，也希望给老夫几分薄面，勿要在大会期间生出事端。¤In addition, watching the battle to support the Daoist friends, I also hope to give the old man a few points, do not want to give rise to trouble during the General Assembly.
随着最后一场比试结束，决出了最终的冠军，大会也在众人潮水般的喝彩声中，接近了尾声。你二人也回到了最初的位置。¤As the last competition ended, the final champion was decided, and the conference drew to a close amidst a tidal wave of applause. You two also returned to the initial position.
你着重观察了几位善用¤You focused on observing several people making good use of
大会结束，天机阁派遣供奉来与你们寒暄一番后，你便也带着思绪离开了。¤After the conference was over and the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion sent guest elders to exchange pleasantries with you, you left with your thoughts as well.
倪兄，此番甚是尽兴，不过若真想参加此等大赛，还得抓紧时间修炼才是。¤Brother Ni, this is very enjoyable, but if you really want to participate in these competitions, you still have to make good time to cultivate.
托倪兄的福，还算是小有收获。不知倪兄可有看到什么新鲜事？¤Thanks to Brother Ni's blessing, I have made a small harvest. I wonder if Brother Ni has seen anything new?
道的修士，专心致志地观察他的一招一式，一些平常难以注意到的最为细节的东西也被你捕捉到了许多。¤Tao's cultivator, concentrating on observing his moves, some of the most detailed things that are usually difficult to notice are also captured by you a lot.
随着最后一行字刻完，新的天机榜便写好了，这十个名字将伴随风雨走过这新的一百年。¤With the last line engraved, the new Tianji list was written, and these ten names will accompany the wind and rain through this new hundred years.
那边好像有个使剑的！我们快去看看！¤There seems to be a sword maker over there! Let's go check it out!
你则专门找个一位善用¤You should find someone who can make good use of it.
只见他手一挥，天机榜上密密麻麻的字皆被抹掉，又以指为笔，在天机榜上凌空刻起一行行的字来，赫然便是那前十的名字。¤He saw a wave of his hand, the dense words on the list of heavenly opportunities were erased, and finger as a pen, in the sky on the list of heavenly opportunities carved up a line of words, which is the top ten names.
比赛当天，你落座在广场上方漂浮的假山上，身旁也尽是一些元婴修士。其中几位虽与你有过一面之缘，但也仅限于此。¤On the day of the competition, you were seated on a floating rockery above the square, surrounded by YuanYing cultivators. A few of them had a chance to meet you, but that was all.
大赛上的比试，双方或见招拆招，变招与反应都是极快；或对峙而立，一旦出手便是要决出胜负；或攻守分明，极致的矛与盾之碰撞……其玄妙程度乃你生平仅见，思绪万千。¤The competition at the Grand Prix, the two sides or see the moves, change and reaction are extremely fast; or confrontation and stand, once the fight is to determine the winner; or attack and defense is clear, the ultimate collision of spear and shield ...... its subtlety is the only thing you have seen in your life, thinking a thousand thoughts.
最后，祝愿所有参赛修士机榜题名，所有观战的道友皆有所顿悟。¤Finally, I wish all the participating cultivators the best of luck, and all those who are watching the battle have an epiphany.
道的修士，深入钻研他们的招式，连最微小的细节也不放过。¤The Taoist cultivators, delving deep into their moves, do not spare even the smallest details.
倘若你还是元婴境界，这些比试倒还有些看头，但在如今的你眼里，就像孩童嬉闹一般稚嫩。¤If you were still in the realm of the firstborn, these competitions would still be interesting, but in your eyes today, it's like a child's playfulness.
其次，所有比赛都需点到为止。为了保证大会没有意外发生，每个赛场都有我阁一名元婴期供奉作为裁判，若有情况，他们将自行判断是否需要出手干预。¤Secondly, all competitions need to be on point. In order to ensure that there are no accidents in the conference, each arena has a YuanYing stage guest elder of my pavilion as a judge, if there is a situation, they will judge for themselves whether they need to intervene.
还未等倪旭欣回应，一阵笑声便吸引了全场的注意。¤Before Ni XuXin could respond, a laugh attracted the attention of the entire audience.
倪兄，我想仔细钻研一下自己的东西，就不与倪兄同行了。¤Brother Ni, I want to carefully delve into my own things, so I will not travel with Brother Ni.
几天下来，你收获颇丰。¤A few days down, you have gained a lot.
几天下来，你二人走马观花之下，倒也看出来了一些门道。¤A few days down, you two under the horse and buggy, but also see out some doorway.
很快，比赛便开始了。你能看见各流派高手在擂台上各施手段，招式层出不穷。¤Soon, the competition begins. You can see the masters of each school in the ring, the tricks are endless.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，此地只能看清最近两个擂台，不如我们四处逛逛，也好多长长见识！¤The first name is {FirstName}{xiongdi}, this place can only see the nearest two rings, why don't we stroll around, or grow more knowledge!
比试开始了约莫一炷香的时间后，台上的修士打的正酣，但倪旭欣似乎有些坐不住了。¤About an incense stick of time after the competition started, the cultivators on the stage were in the middle of a fight, but Ni XuXin seemed to be sitting down a bit.
比赛当天，偌大的广场上里三层外三层围满了修士。不过由于天机阁给每位修士都安排好了位置，整体上倒也显得井然有序。¤On the day of the competition, the large square was surrounded by cultivators in three layers. But because the Heavens Secrets Pavilion has arranged the position for each cultivator, the overall also seems to be orderly.
可若全宁州最大规模的比试尚且如此，还有什么值得你注目呢？¤But if the largest competition in Ning Province is still like this, what else is worth your attention?
今天能邀请这么多人来参加天机大比，实乃我阁之幸，范某便在此谢过各位了。¤It is a blessing for my pavilion to invite so many people to the Tianji Grand Competition today, so Fan would like to thank you all here.
你刚要回应，铁剑中却传来了老爷爷的声音。¤You are just about to respond, but the voice of the old grandfather comes from the iron sword.
真威风呐…有朝一日，我也要在这榜上留下我倪旭欣的名字！¤What a great style... One day, I want to leave my name on this list too, Ni XuXin!
各位，在下乃天机阁阁主范杰。¤Ladies and gentlemen, I am Fan Jie, the head of the Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
莫要急着答应，跟着他看固然能开阔眼界，但若真想学点东西，还是得专注跟着一个人学才好。¤Do not rush to agree, follow him to see can certainly open eyes, but if you really want to learn something, or have to focus on following a person to learn better.
虽然他并未释放任何威压，但会场上的修士们还是不约而同地安静了下来。¤Although he did not release any pressure, but the cultivators in the meeting hall still unintentionally quiet.
比赛当天，你落座在广场上方漂浮的假山上，身旁也尽是一些金丹修士。其中几位虽与你有过一面之缘，但也仅限于此。¤On the day of the competition, you were seated on a floating rockery above the square, surrounded by some Jindan cultivators. A few of them had a one-sided relationship with you, but that was all.
只见四十八位来自各流派的高手从空中漂浮的小山上一齐飞出，分落在六座擂台上，完成了他们的第一次亮相。¤I saw forty-eight experts from various schools fly out from the floating hill in the air and land on the six rings, completing their first appearance.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，这几天你钻研的怎么样了？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, how are you doing these days drilling?
倪兄说的是，大会期间我们便一同观战吧。¤Ni brother said yes, during the conference we will watch the battle together.
大比当天，你位列上宾，坐在会场上方视野最佳的假山上。以你的神识可以轻易笼罩整个会场。¤On the day of the competition, you were ranked as the guest of honor, sitting on the false mountain with the best view above the venue. With your soul sense you can easily encompass the entire venue.
众人喧嚣之时，你兀的消失在了原地。有不少人注意到了此事，但却不敢声张。没人知道你去了哪里。¤When the crowd was clamoring, you abruptly disappeared in the same place. A number of people noticed the matter, but did not dare to voice it. No one knows where you have gone.
这天魔的神通虽是独到且棘手，奈何与之对战的是你，不但境界压如今的它一头，实力也不是一般化神修士能相比的。¤This heavenly devil's divine ability is unique and tricky, but it is you who is fighting against it, not only the realm pressure now it head, the strength is also not the general Deity Transformation cultivator can compare.
气浪所至，天魔眼核心中的魔气被一扫而空，因充满玄堇色魔气而昏暗了不知多久的阵法空间中竟是明亮了起来。¤The wave of air to the core of the heavenly devil's eye was swept away, because full of xuan cordial-colored devil gas and dim for an unknown period of time in the formation space is actually brightened up.
{FirstName}{$NickName} 这是把天魔灭杀了？¤{FirstName}{$NickName} This is to exterminate the heavenly devil?
看来是天魔被大能的阵法封印多年，已经无比虚弱。或者，此中可能有些隐情。¤It seems that the heavenly devil has been sealed by the formation of the great power for many years and has been incomparably weak. Perhaps, there may be some hidden agenda here.
但这琉璃麒麟并未造成过于华丽的声势，只是身形暴涨之后，一口将那魔气团吞下，而后径直爆炸开来。¤But this glazed qilin did not cause too magnificent sound, just after the body surged, a mouthful of that magic group swallowed, and then exploded straight away.
即便隔着些距离。¤Even if separated by some distance.
这样么。¤I see.
反倒是炎萧解决了那两名魔修，前来与你汇合。¤Instead, Yan Xiao solved the two evil cultivators and came to rejoin you.
看来有效...¤It seems to be effective...
似乎是的。¤It seems to be.
一道气浪从爆炸处席卷而出，冲击得炎萧的衣袍猎猎作响，更是让你险些站立不稳。¤A wave of air swept out from the explosion, impacted Yan Xiao's robe hunting, but also let you nearly unstable.
炎萧维持赤色火焰的同时，左手升起一道苍、青两色的火焰。手指轻弹，后者便如同流星一般，带着一道绚丽的焰尾向赤色火焰急射而去。¤Yan Xiao maintain the red flame at the same time, the left hand rose a pale, green two-colored flame. Finger flick, the latter will be like a meteor, with a gorgeous flame tail to the red flame shot sharply.
{FirstName}{$NickName}，这是将天魔解决了么？¤{FirstName}{$NickName}, this is the sky demon will be solved?
这是...失败了？¤This is... Failure?
是的，但这天魔化作一团魔气后，我用尽手段都无法将之击散。¤Yes, but after this heavenly demon transformed into a cloud of demonic energy, I couldn't break it up with all my means.
在你的攻击下，魔气虽是剧烈的翻腾，但依旧有重新聚集的趋势。见状你经过短暂蓄力后，又是几式神通接踵而至，这才让那魔气团有了消散的趋势。¤Under your attack, the magic qi is violently tossed, but still has the tendency to re-gather. Seeing this you after a short time to build up your strength, and then a few more divine powers followed, which made that magic qi mass have a tendency to dissipate.
你居然...单枪匹马地解决了天魔么？当年可是连化神强者出手也未能将之奈何。¤You actually... Did you solve the Heavenly Demon single-handedly? Back then, even the strongest of the Deity Transformation couldn't stop it.
嗯，但时隔太久，你我也难以揣测当年发生了什么。¤Well, but too much time has passed, and it is difficult for you and me to guess what happened back then.
幸不辱命。¤Fortunately, the life.
炎萧一脸惊讶地看着那团魔气，显然是对于你力战天魔甚至取胜非常惊讶。¤Yan Xiao looked at that mass of magic Qi with a surprised face, obviously very surprised that you forcefully fought the heavenly devil and even won.
即便这麒麟的目标不是你。¤Even if this qilin's target is not you.
（也好，我先疗伤吧，嘶...这妖人下手真够狠的。）¤(It's good, I'll heal first. Hiss... This demon is really ruthless.)
你点了点头，没有再说什么，示意炎萧准备离开天魔眼。¤You nodded and said nothing more, gesturing for Yan Xiao to prepare to leave the Heavenly Demon Eye.
你与天魔缠斗一会后，终于是难以招架它的各种奇异神通，被其击倒在地。体内更是被魔气占据，每次运转功法时皆是剧痛难忍，连意识都因之模糊起来。¤After you tangled with the Heavenly Demon for a while, you finally had difficulty fighting its various strange divine abilities and were knocked to the ground by it. Your body was taken over by the devil's energy, and every time you run your kung fu, it hurts so badly that your consciousness is blurred.
现下天魔已死，你也没有其他要事，便饶有兴趣地看起炎萧的战斗来。¤Now that the Heavenly Demon is dead, you have no other important business, so you look at Yan Xiao's battle with interest.
看来是天魔被大能的阵法据说多年，已经无比虚弱。或者，此中可能有些隐情。¤It seems to be that the Heavenly Demon has been said to be incomparably weakened by the mighty formation for many years. Alternatively, there may be some hidden truths in this.
想象中的死亡并没有到来，肉体与神魂的痛楚也在提醒着你还活着。¤The imagined death did not come, and the pain of the flesh and the soul is a reminder that you are still alive.
炎萧之前能在天魔道的阵法中以一敌三，如今没了阵法，对上的敌人又是只有两人，其中一个更是被你重伤，解决他们自是不难。¤Yan Xiao was able to defeat three people with one in the Heavenly Demon Dao's formation before, now without the formation and against an enemy of only two people, one of whom was even seriously injured by you, it is not difficult to solve them since.
举手投足之间，你已是将这天魔压制得毫无反抗之力。最后更是重新化作一团魔气，无助地漂浮在半空，却被接踵而至的攻击打散，就此消失在此方空间中，与其他的魔气融为一体。¤In a matter of hands and feet, you have already suppressed this heavenly demon to the point of being defenseless. In the end, you turned into a cloud of demonic energy, floating helplessly in mid-air, only to be dispersed by the attacks that followed, and disappeared into this space, merging with the other demonic energy.
你试探着用神通攻击天魔化作的魔气团。但只是引起魔气一阵翻腾，却未出现实质性的变化。¤You try to use the divine ability to attack the devil's magic gas mass. But it only caused a tumble of demonic qi, but no substantial change.
但我听门中前辈所说，曾经封印天魔的大能正是因为无法消灭它，才用其阵法修为结合由天地所造的天魔眼，将之拘束于此。¤But I heard from my predecessors in the door that the great power that once sealed the heavenly devil was unable to destroy it, so he used his formation cultivation combined with the heavenly devil's eye created by heaven and earth to bind it here.
终于，在你的不断轰击下，这天魔化作的魔气团消散在此方天地，再未聚集。¤Finally, under your continuous bombardment, this heavenly devil turned into a mass of devilish qi dissipated in this heaven and earth and never gathered again.
无法将之击散么，让我来试试。¤I can't break it up, let me try.
当他后知后觉地发现你单枪匹马解决了天魔时，竟是愣在了原地。饶是以他的见识，依旧是半晌没回过神来。¤When he found out after the fact that you had single-handedly solved the heavenly demon, he was frozen in place. Forgive him for his knowledge, is still half a long time did not come back to his senses.
只听一声悲嚎后，这天魔终于是支撑不住，重新化作一团魔气漂浮于阵法空间中。¤After hearing only a wail of sorrow, this heavenly devil finally could not support himself and reincarnated into a cloud of devilish qi floating in the formation space.
没等你说完，炎萧身上咆哮着的怒焰再次升腾，那夹杂着青、白的赤焰似是要将魔气燃尽一般...¤Did not wait for you to finish, Yan Xiao's body roaring angry flames rose again, that intermingled with green and white red flames seem to be to burn out the magic Qi...
这苍、青色火焰与赤色火焰融为一体后，缓慢地变化着，最后竟是转变为一只琉璃色麒麟。¤This pale, cyan flame and red flame fused into one, slowly changing, and finally was actually transformed into a glazed-colored qilin.
未待你旁观多久，其便是将魔修烧做飞灰，并收起法宝走至你身旁。¤Before you wait to watch for a long time, it is the evil cultivator will be burned into flying ashes, and put away the magic treasure to walk beside you.
这天魔方才从封印中脱离，又哪是你这等天之骄子的对手。¤This heavenly devil has only just broken free from the seal, and is no match for a heavenly pride like you.
炎萧{$ChenHu}，我...¤Yan Xiao {$ChenHu}, I...
有些，在你印象里并不存在，是新添的。¤Some, in your impression does not exist, is a new addition.
再次升腾！¤Rising again!
你看魔气似乎还在冰块中收缩膨胀，像是呼吸一般，不由得出声询问。但炎萧不置可否，只是淡淡一笑。¤You see the magic gas seems to be still in the ice contraction expansion, like breathing general, can not help but ask. But Yan Xiao does not deny, just a faint smile.
哈哈哈，若不是{FirstName}{$NickName}先将天魔消耗大半，即便我能解决天魔，恐怕也要在此苦战不知多久。¤Hahaha, if not {FirstName}{$NickName} first consume most of the heavenly devil, even if I can solve the heavenly devil, I'm afraid I have to fight here for a long time.
即便相差一个大境界，你无法想象炎萧这招该有的威力。¤Even if there is a big realm difference, you can't imagine the power that Yan Xiao's move should have.
也不过是随意的两道神通，本就重伤的魔修立时陨落。另一个魔修也是乱了阵脚，被炎萧趁势击杀。¤It was just two random divine powers, the already seriously injured evil cultivator immediately fell. The other evil cultivator was also in disarray and was killed by Yan Xiao taking advantage of the situation.
你略微思考后，深吸一口气，灵气崩腾于四肢百骸之中，完成蓄力之后，以你最强的神通轰击在魔气团之上。¤After you think a little, take a deep breath, aura collapse in the limbs and bones, after completing the accumulation of force, with your strongest divine power blast on top of the demon gas group.
你见尝试有些成效，当然不会放过这天魔，于是不仅是神通，法宝也同时攻向天魔。¤You see try some results, of course, will not let go of this heavenly devil, so not only the divine power, magic treasures also attacked the heavenly devil at the same time.
直到你走过去拍了拍炎萧的肩膀，后者才呢喃着开口。¤Until you walked over and patted Yan Xiao's shoulder, the latter only murmured and spoke.
你考量了下自己的状态，没有选择与炎萧一起上前围攻天魔，而是退后一段距离，在紧急处理伤势的同时，关注着战场，以防万一。¤You considered your state and did not choose to go up with Yan Xiao to besiege the Heavenly Demon, but instead retreated some distance, keeping an eye on the battlefield while urgently treating your injuries, just in case.
我也不知，据门中前辈所说，曾经封印天魔的大能正是因为无法消灭它，才用其阵法修为结合由天地所造的天魔眼，将之拘束于此。¤I also do not know, according to the senior in the door, once sealed the heavenly devil of the great power precisely because it could not destroy it, only with its formation cultivation combined with the heavenly devil eye created by heaven and earth, will be bound here.
{FirstName}{$NickName}实力真是出乎意料，不但能击败天魔，还能将之灭杀，佩服。¤{FirstName}{$NickName} strength is really unexpected, not only can defeat the heavenly devil, but also extinguish it, admire.
炎萧对战两个天魔道修士虽然没什么压力，但你还是决定出手解决魔修。¤Yan Xiao against two Heavenly Demon Dao cultivators although there is little pressure, but you still decided to strike to solve the evil cultivator.
辛苦了，接下来就交给我吧。¤I'll leave the rest to me.
炎萧也恰好解决了那两名魔修，正欲过来与你汇合。¤Yan Xiao also happened to have settled the two evil cultivators and was about to come over and join you.
你说完之后，俩人陷入短暂的沉默中。¤After you finish, the two of you fall into a short silence.
入眼的满是玄堇色，绝望，且冰冷的玄堇色...¤The eyes are full of xuan cordial color, despair, and cold xuan cordial color...
哈哈哈，若不是{FirstName}{$NickName}先将天魔拖住，凭我的实力也无法同时面对天魔和数个魔修。¤Hahaha, if {FirstName}{$NickName} hadn't stalled the Heavenly Demon first, with my strength I wouldn't have been able to face the Heavenly Demon and several evil cultivators at the same time.
这天魔...竟有些如此难缠的威能！¤This heavenly devil... There is actually something so difficult and powerful!
这天魔可没传说中那么厉害，我随手便把它解决了。¤This heavenly devil is not as powerful as the legend, I will solve it with my hands.
但据门中前辈所说，曾经封印天魔的大能正是因为无法消灭它，才用其阵法修为结合由天地所造的天魔眼，将之拘束于此。而我不过元婴境修士，为何能灭杀这天魔呢。¤But according to the seniors in the sect, the great power that once sealed the Heavenly Demon was unable to destroy it, so he used his formation cultivation combined with the Heavenly Demon Eye created by the heavens and earth to bind it here. And I am only a YuanYing realm cultivator, why can destroy this heavenly demon.
有些，是上一场留下的，还未完全恢复，又哀鸣着出现了。¤Some, left over from the last game, have not fully recovered and are wailing to appear again.
炎萧{$ChenHu}过誉了。但有一事让我不解，据说这天魔连化神大能也未能消灭，为何我却能...¤Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} is too much. But there is one thing that I do not understand, it is said that this heavenly devil even the Deity Transformation has not been able to destroy, why I can ...
正当你不解时，那冰块“呲咔”的一声，裂了开来，其中的魔气也随裂缝溢出，却是逸散至四周，没有再次聚集的迹象。¤When you do not understand, the ice 'bared click' sound, cracked, which the magic gas also spilled out with the cracks, but escaped to the surrounding, no signs of gathering again.
这天魔虽强，但你也从来不是普通的元婴修士。你在功法的加持下，各类神通不断而出，配合着法宝一次又一次冲击着天魔的防御。¤Although this heavenly devil is strong, but you are never an ordinary YuanYing cultivator. You are under the power of the gong method, all kinds of divine ability constantly out, with the magic treasure again and again impacted the defense of the heavenly devil.
炎萧收起法宝走到你面前，你能感觉到他身上伤口虽多，精神却很振奋。¤Yan Xiao put away the magic treasure to walk to you, you can feel his body wounds, although many, but the spirit is very cheerful.
炎萧身上的伤口又多了一些。¤Yan Xiao's body had some more wounds.
炎萧将法宝收起后便是走至你身旁。¤Yan Xiao put away the magic treasure and then walked to your side.
炎萧一脸惊讶地看着那团魔气，显然是对于你一个金丹修士能力战天魔甚至取胜非常惊讶。¤Yan Xiao looked at the group of magic gas with astonishment, apparently for you a jindan cultivator ability to battle the heavenly devil and even win very surprised.
看来没有让你失望，我成功了。¤It seems that I did not let you down, I succeeded.
这...这是！¤This... This is!
但有一事让我不解，据说这天魔连化神大能也未能消灭，为何我却能...¤But there is one thing I don't understand, it is said that this heavenly demon even the Deity Transformation has not been able to destroy, but why I can ...
一声怒号从前方传来，但你也只能勉强抬头看向天魔。¤An angry cry comes from the front, but you can only barely look up at the celestial demon.
在炎萧火焰的烧灼下，那团魔气竟在“呲呲”声的伴随下不断缩小。¤Under the desolate scorching flames, the mass of devilish energy kept shrinking accompanied with the ominous sound ''crackle crackle''
相顾无言，你示意炎萧准备离开天魔眼。¤Looking at each other without words, you gesture to Yan Xiao to prepare to leave the Heavenly Demon Eye.
待爆炸的火光散去，却见到团被冻住的魔气坠落在地上。¤When the fire of the explosion dissipated, but I saw the mass of frozen demonic Qi fell to the ground.
炎萧话音刚落，身上气势已是暴涨，一股灼热的灵气随之升起。而后他手捏法诀，一道赤色火焰于魔气团下方升起。¤As soon as Yan Xiao's words fell, his aura had already soared, and a burning aura rose up with it. And then his hand squeezed the magic trick, a red flame in the magic qi mass below the rise.
但这些都不足以让你对它产生畏惧！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤But none of this is enough to make you fear it! {vpunch=10,0.5}
而炎萧也没有辜负的期望。在他那强大的实力下，即便是伤痕累累且历经连续战斗，依旧压制得那天魔喘不过气来，后者仅是稍一分心便已是陨落于此。¤And Yan Xiao did not disappoint the expectations. In his powerful strength, even if it is scarred and after continuous fighting, still suppressed that day the devil could not breathe, the latter is only a little distracted is already fallen in this.
天魔的轻易消散让你有些奇怪，但也没太上心，只是将目光投向炎萧与仅存魔修的战斗。¤The easy dissipation of the Heavenly Demon makes you wonder a little, but you don't get too attached to it, and just turn your attention to the battle between Yan Xiao and the only remaining evil cultivator.
嗯，就刚才的情况来看，要灭杀虚弱状态的天魔并不难，甚至强一些的元婴修士费上一番功夫也能做到。若不是传说有些偏差，应该是其中有些隐情了。¤Well, judging from the situation just now, it is not difficult to exterminate the weakened Heavenly Demon, and even stronger YuanYing cultivators can do it with some effort. If the legend is not a little deviant, should be some of the hidden truth.
多亏炎萧{$Chenhu}援助及时。¤Thanks to Yan Xiao {$Chenhu} assistance in time.
可即便是你灵气近乎枯竭，也未能将这魔气团集散。¤But even your aura is nearly depleted, but also failed to disperse this magic group.
人类，这里不是你该来的地方，速速离去，莫要扰了本座修行。¤Human, this is not a place for you to come, leave quickly, do not disturb this seat cultivation.
哼，小小蝼蚁，不自量力。¤Hmph, a little mole, not measuring up to itself.
原来是{FirstName}小友，不知来此何事？¤So it is {FirstName} little friend, I wonder what is the matter here?
哼，好大的胆子。既然你自己送上门来，那就受死吧！¤Humph, what nerve. Since you sent yourself to the door, then suffer death!
哈哈哈，早就听说{FirstName}小友修为不俗，能与你全力一战想必也是痛快之事。¤I've long heard that {FirstName}you are not a bad cultivator, and I think it would be painful to fight with you at full strength.
他随手丢出一枚玉简。你粗略扫过其中内容后，便察觉到了其中的端倪。¤He casually threw out a jade slip. You cursory sweep through the contents, and then perceived the end of it.
孰轻孰重，道友自行掂量罢，我便在此恭候{$xiaoyou}的好消息了。¤I'll be waiting for good news from {$xiaoyou}.
此乃逆天造化术，道友收好。¤This is a reverse heaven creation technique, daoist friends to receive.
一年以内，此城便会有一人飞升，届时你带着需要重铸肉身的灵魂体来此城便是。¤Within a year, a person will ascend in this city, at that time you will come to this city with your soul body that needs to be recast.
在下不方便出手，所以希望前辈来帮忙除掉他。¤I am not at liberty to do so, so I hope the seniors will come and help get rid of him.
此人虽明面上与阴魂岛交好，但老夫猜测其暗中有所图谋。¤Although this person is openly befriended with the Yin Soul Island, but the old man guessed that it secretly has a plan.
{$xiaoyou}若能收集齐五枚神阴石，或是为我们除掉非也，此物自然奉上¤{If you can collect all five Divine Yin Stones, or if you can get rid of Feiya for us, I will give you this item.
此术乃老夫立岛之本。魂体使用此术，可重新铸造一副与生前无二的身躯。¤The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you are doing. The soul body using this technique can recast a body that is no different from the one before it was born.
考虑自然没问题，只是如今神阴石越来越难找了，岛上许多魂体找了成百上千年，也没有找出一块来。¤Consider naturally no problem, only nowadays the divine Yin stone is increasingly difficult to find, many souls on the island have searched for hundreds of years, but also did not find a piece to.
{$xiaoyou}少安毋躁，虽说此法的确难以实现，不过老夫已有解决之道了。¤The {$xiaoyou} is not to be impatient, although this method is indeed difficult to achieve, but I already have a solution.
{$xiaoyou}若想换得此术，可以尝试完成向之恒或无尘委托的任务，或是用五枚神阴石换取。¤{If you want to exchange for this technique, you can try to complete the task entrusted by Xiang Zhiheng or Wuduan, or exchange it with five divine Yin stones.
不愧是前辈。¤But there is one more thing that interests me. The upper part you mentioned before, could it be called the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique?
既然秘术已经到手，此处大抵便没有留恋的必要了。¤Now that the secret art is in hand, there is probably no need to stay here.
原来此术是要借助修士飞升才可施展，难怪你想让本座在这里渡劫。¤It turns out that this technique can only be performed with the help of a cultivator's ascension, so no wonder you want this seat to be here for the tribulation.
{$xiaoyou}无需担心，届时只管来此城便是，其余事情我自会安排妥当。¤{I'll arrange the rest.
此乃逆天造化术，前辈收好。¤This is the Reverse Creation Technique, senior, keep it.
你可知道那非也？¤Do you know that non also?
他恭敬地递上一枚玉简。你粗略扫过其中内容后，便察觉到了其中的端倪。¤He respectfully hands over a jade slip. After you have scanned its contents roughly, you perceive the implications.
呵呵，这便是这阴魂岛最大的秘密了，还容老夫卖个关子。¤He he, this is the biggest secret of Yin Soul Island, and i've sold this secret for a bargain.
我等不方便出手，所以希望你来暗中除掉他。¤We are not in a position to take action, so we want you to get rid of him secretly.
只见他微微仰首，抚须而笑，俨然一副成竹在胸的样子。¤You see him tilting his head slightly, stroking his beard and smiling, just as if he had a plan in place.
另有准备？¤Another preparation?
不错，不过就算前辈不答应在下，在下也另有准备。¤Not bad, but even if you don't agree with me, I have other preparations.
嗯，本座考虑考虑。¤Well, this seat will think about it.
呵呵，{$xiaoyou}竟真能收集五块神阴石，不错。¤Oh, {$xiaoyou} actually managed to collect five divine Yin stones, not bad.
岛主莫非在说笑？重铸肉身需要飞升时所引出的上界仙气？这等苛刻的条件如何实现？¤Is the island master joking? To re-cast your body, you need the immortal qi that is drawn from the upper world when you ascend? How can such a harsh condition be achieved?
…的确如此，此事可尚有回旋余地？¤...Indeed, is there anything we can do in this matter?
{$xiaoyou}何事？¤{$xiaoyou} what is it?
若你能除掉此人，那么逆天造化术依旧双手奉上。¤If you can get rid of this person, then the Heavenly Creation Technique will still be offered with both hands.
届时再说罢。¤We'll talk about it then.
…可否待我考虑一二？¤...Can I have a moment or two to think about it?
{$xiaoyou}若有寻到，我愿用一些稀有的天才地宝向你换取。¤{$xiaoyou}If found, I would like to use some rare genius treasures to you in exchange.
这…倒是的确有一事…¤Well...there is indeed one thing...
倒是的确有一事…¤Rather, there is indeed a matter...
一年以内，此城便会有一人飞升，前辈若有兴趣，届时大可前来见证一番。¤If you are interested, you can come and witness the ascension of a person in this city within a year.
前辈可知道那非也？¤elders can know that non also?
他皱着眉头、眯起眼睛，俨然一副心事重重的样子。¤He frowned and narrowed his eyes, just like a heavy hearted look.
除开收集到五块神阴石可以交换外，在向之恒与无尘那完成任意一件指定的任务也可换取。¤In addition to collecting five divine yin stones that can be exchanged, completing any of the designated tasks at Xiang Zhiheng and Wudu can also be exchanged.
呵呵，看来{$xiaoyou}已经完成了约定的任务。¤Oh, it seems that {$xiaoyou} has completed the agreed task.
听闻{$xiaoyou}对逆天造化术颇有兴趣，向之恒与无尘交代的事情却没有做成，可有此事？¤I heard that {$xiaoyou} is quite interested in the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique, and the things that were explained to Zhiheng and Wudu were not made, can this happen?
…你怎知道有人会来此渡劫？¤...How did you know that someone would come here to cross the tribulation?
这两件事本座都没兴趣，可有其他的事情需要本座处理？¤These two things are not interested in this seat, but there are other things that need to be handled by this seat?
在{$shijian}年后，此城便会有一人飞升，前辈若有兴趣，届时大可前来见证一番。¤In {$shijian} years, this city will have a person ascending, elders if interested, then you can come to witness some.
在{$shijian}年后，此城便会有一人飞升，届时你带着需要重铸肉身的灵魂体来此城便是。¤In {$shijian} years, there will be a person ascending in this city, at that time you bring the soul body that needs to recast the flesh to this city is.
好身手，我们也算不打不相识了。¤Good skill, we don't know each other anymore.
好，我这便为你启动阵法。如果你被幻象击败，会自动传送出阵。¤Okay, I will activate the formation for you. If you are defeated by the illusion, you will be automatically teleported out of the formation.
{shidi}能够在炼气期就闯过幻雾阵，日后成就一定不可限量啊。¤{shidi} can break through the Mirage Mist Array while only in the Qi Refinement realm, your future is boundless.
幻雾阵是我派长老们联合布下的阵法，一旦入阵，就会进入幻境，受到长老们所设幻象的攻击。在幻阵之中坚持的越久，越能磨炼你的{color=#d0380a}心境{/color}，如果你的{color=#d0380a}悟性{/color}高，还有可能从幻象的攻击中领悟我派的至深法门。¤The Mirage Mist Array is a joint formation by our elders. Once in the array, you will enter the illusion and be attacked by the illusion set by the elders. The longer you persist in the illusion, the more you can temper your {color= #d0380a}Mentality{/color}, if you have a high {color=#d0380a} comprehension{/color}, it is possible to comprehend the deepest method I send from the attack of phantoms.
{shixiong}，要去幻雾阵历练一番么？¤{shixiong}, are you going to challenge the Mirage Mist Array?
当然，想要通过与幻象的交手来领悟法门是很难的，这么多年来我还没有见到有哪位师兄成功过。¤Of course, it is very difficult to comprehend the method by fighting against the illusion. I have not seen any senior brother who has succeeded in so many years.
{shidi}，要去幻雾阵历练一番么？¤{shidi}, are you going to challenge the Mirage Mist Array?
云雾在你的眼前开始翻涌，你感到一阵天旋地转，恍惚中，你已经进入了幻境之中。¤The clouds and mist begin to surging in front of your eyes. You feel the sky spinning around, in a trance, you have entered the illusion.
真希望有朝一日能够见识一番！¤I hope I can see it one day!
听说这无尽之海上有四大妖圣，个个修为通天，就连化神期的大能也奈何不了它们。¤I heard that there are four great demon saints in this endless sea, all of them are cultivated to reach the sky, and even the power of the Deity Transformation stage can't help them.
最近这几届的猎魔试炼死伤尤为严重，我派亦有不少弟子送了性命...¤The deaths and injuries in recent trials of the demon hunting have been particularly serious, and many of my disciples have also been killed...
人的精力终究是有限的，炼丹炼器，制符布阵之术都只是辅助，难成正道。¤Human energy is limited after all, alchemy, refining and talisman formation techniques are only auxiliary, it is difficult to become a righteous way.
之前已经是救命之恩了，但延寿丹家师之前已经服用过两粒了，上一次就只生效了一粒。¤It had already been a life-saver before, but the Life Extension Pill had already been taken twice before by the family master, and only one had taken effect the last time.
哦？道友知晓本门？那倒是方便了，不用我在做介绍了。¤Oh? Do you know our school? That's convenient, there's no need for me to make an introduction.
嘿嘿，正好我这里还剩一枚。¤Hey, it just so happens that I have one left here.
两万一枚。¤20,000 a piece.
这是本门秘药玄古丹，除了能延年益寿更能易经伐髓调整资质。¤This is our secret medicine, the Profound Ancient Pill, which not only prolongs life but also improves the quality of the meridians and marrow.
早就听闻倪家大少不仅剑术高超更是精于炼丹，不知您可否帮我问问。¤I have heard that the Ni family's youngest is not only an excellent swordsman but also a master of alchemy.
道友，是在求购延寿丹药么？¤Fellow Daoist, are you seeking a life extension Pill?
这玄古丹乃是本门不传之秘，但道友孝心着实令人动容，我就作价两万灵石卖于道友。¤This Profound Ancient Pill is a secret not passed down by our clan, but your filial piety is really touching, so I will sell it to you for 20,000 spirit stones.
道友，这延寿丹药本就是有价无市，上次也是巧合，大少爷炼制了一批延寿丹我便帮你留了两粒。¤Fellow Daoist, this Life Extension Pill is originally priced but not marketable. Last time, it was also a coincidence that I saved two pills for you when the Eldest Young Master made a batch of Life Extension Pills.
这就是玄古丹？阁下是玄古门的道友吧。¤This is the Profound Ancient Dan? Your Excellency is a fellow Daoist of the Profound Ancient Sect, right?
你现在又来求购青冥丹，你真的是为难在下了。¤You have now come to ask for the Green Meditation Pill, you are really making things difficult for me.
说罢，拿出一个黑瓶在掌心倒出一粒丹药。¤Saying this, he took out a black bottle and poured out a pill in his palm.
嘿嘿，钱货两清，承蒙惠顾。¤Hey, money and goods, thanks for your patronage.
一进门你就看到一个人面露焦急的拉着灵药堂管事。¤As soon as you enter the door you see a man with an anxious face pulling the Spirit Herb Hall Steward.
说罢，他掌中出现一样的黑色小瓶，另只手向你伸出。¤With that, the same black vial appears in his palm and his other hand is extended towards you.
原以为四魔剑皆流落各州，不曾想竟是那玄机散人封印了戮仙剑，不知其余的魔剑下落如何......¤I thought that the four Demonic Swords were all living in the various states, but I never thought that the mysterious stray person had sealed the Immortal Executing Sword. I don't know where the other Demon Swords are...
{FirstName}道友，此番你可有寻得衍复真人的消息？¤{FirstName} Fellow Daoist, have you found any news about Lord Yanfu this time?
这是...衍复长老的笔录！原来他竟也迷失在了宁州古迹的煞气中么...真是天道可畏。¤This is... Elder Yanfu's transcript! It turns out that he was also lost in the evil spirit of Ning Province's historic sites... It's awesome.
{FirstName}长老，此番你可有寻得衍复真人的消息？¤Elder {FirstName}, were you able to find news about Lord Yanfu this time?
不管如何，门派定不会亏待{FirstName}长老，这是你应得的报酬。¤No matter what, the school will not treat elder {FirstName} badly, this is the reward you deserve.
你远远地发现一只独自游荡的下等魔...¤From afar you find an inferior demon wandering alone...
虽然早就在宗门古籍中研读过天劫的记录，但没想到真正的雷劫竟恐怖如斯，就算是白帝也未能渡过。¤Although he had long studied the records of the Heavenly Tribulation in the clan's ancient books, he did not expect that the real lightning tribulation would be so terrifying that even the White Emperor had failed to cross it.
虽然早就在宗门古籍中研读过天劫的记录，但真正观摩前辈渡劫的英姿，还是令我收益匪浅呐。¤Although I had already studied the records of the heavenly tribulation in the clan's ancient books, I still gained a lot from actually observing the heroic gesture of my predecessors during the tribulation.
此番回去以后，也是时候开始闭关为渡劫做准备了...¤After this return, it is time to start preparing for the tribulation in seclusion...
这就是九霄雷狱中孕育出的九天劫火吧。¤This is the Nine Heavenly Tribulation Flames bred in the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison, right?
嗯，这四散开的灵气似是先天之气。¤Well, the aura that spreads out in all directions seems to be the aura of the innate.
水面上一团雷云凝而不散，一阵阵波动波动向周围四散，在这气息的影响下似乎平日里狂暴的灵气风暴都有些缓和。¤A thundercloud on the surface of the water condensed but did not disperse, a burst of fluctuations spread out in all directions, and under the influence of this breath it seemed that the normally violent aura storm was somewhat moderated.
还没等你反应，一阵波动眼前的火焰就消失不见了。¤Before you can react, a wave of flames in front of you disappears.
这雷云看着和周围似乎不大一样。¤This thundercloud does not seem to be the same as the surrounding area.
这应该是孕育自天地异象之中的先天之火。¤This should be an innate fire bred from the visions of heaven and earth.
此时，那团雷云倏地散开楼漏出一团橙红色的火焰，你能感受到焰心中蕴含着一缕纯净的先天灵气，但一阵阵毁灭气息随着道道火环向外四散。¤At this moment, the thundercloud abruptly disperses from the building to reveal an orange-red flame, you can feel a ray of pure innate spiritual energy in the heart of the flame, but a burst of destructive aura scatters outwards with a ring of fire.
你能感到体内的异火与半空中的火焰以相同的频率跳动。¤You can feel the foreign fire inside you pulsating at the same frequency as the flames in mid-air.
此番切磋真是令我受益匪浅。¤This discussion really benefited me a lot.
竟然已经有鲲族进入了，我还是快些行事吧。¤Even the Kun clan has already entered, so I'd better act quickly.
对方带着你，来到了洞府门口。\n¤The other party took you and came to the door of the cave. \n
《重剑决》是修炼类功法，在战斗时也有【蓄势】攻击，厚积薄发的效果。¤《 Crushing Edge》is a cultivation Technique, and it also has the effect of【Gathered Force】attacks during battle, and accumulating it.
本派入门功法有《金芒诀》，《养刀术》和《重剑决》，你想学习哪一个？¤This school's introductory exercises include Vanishing Blade, Rising Sword, and Crushing Edge Technique. Which one do you want to learn?
哈哈，宗门内的资源可不能用灵石换取，只有对宗门做出贡献的弟子才有资格在藏经阁与神兵阁兑换功法及法器，而这元灵石正是弟子们贡献度的体现。¤Haha, the resources in the sect cannot be exchanged for spirit stones. Only the disciples who have contributed to the sect are eligible to exchange exercises and artifacts in the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion and the Shenbing Pavilion, and this Yuan Lingshi is the disciple. The embodiment of our contribution.
《金芒诀》是战斗类的功法，修炼后能够提升五行连击时金系法门的威能。¤《Vanishing Blade》is a combat technique. After learning it, you can increase the power for Metal in the Elemental Cycle.
{shidi}初来乍到，作为师兄我便私下赠与你一些元灵石，你可小心切莫被长老知晓。¤{shidi} first came here, as a senior, I privately gave you some soul stones, you can be careful not to be known by the elders.
《养刀术》是中庸类的功法，能够在平日修炼时于体内积蓄力量，提升每场战斗造成的第一次伤害。¤《Rising Sword》is a more balanced method, which can accumulate strength in the body during daily cultivation practice and increase the first attack dealt every battle.
呼...好险，这是什么东西？¤Huh...so risky, what is this?
倪家家主见多识广，又精于剑道，或许可以去倪府请教一番...¤The head of the Ni family has a lot of knowledge and is good at kendo. Maybe you can go to Ni Mansion for advice...
太好了，也许从这柄飞剑里就可以找到一些能够唤起你记忆的线索。¤Great, maybe you can find some clues that can evoke your memory from this flying sword.
更奇怪的是，这柄飞剑让我隐约有一丝熟悉的感觉，似乎在哪里见过的样子...¤What's even stranger is that this flying sword gives me a vaguely familiar feeling, as if I have seen it somewhere...
这是剑灵，只有法宝级别以上的仙剑，经过千百年的滋养，才会被孕育出来。¤This is a sword spirit. Only fairy swords above the magic weapon level will be nurtured after thousands of years of nourishment.
只是这剑灵似乎被什么魔气沾染上了，竟然会主动攻击他人。¤It's just that this sword spirit seems to be contaminated by some devilish energy, and it will take the initiative to attack others.
长老这是？¤Elder, is this?
宵小之辈，已被我击毙了。¤Lowly bastard, already get beaten to death by me.
远方驻守此地的执事赶来。¤The deacon who garrison here has arrived from afar.
幸亏长老法力高强，我等竟毫无察觉。¤Fortunately, the elder's mana is so powerful that I didn't even notice it.
嗯，你收拾一下吧。¤Well, you can clean up.
你将自己与魏无极的分析向白帝一一道来。¤You present your analysis of yourself and Wei Wuji to the White Emperor.
而《逆天造化术》，据小{shidi}的描述应该是由师父决定是否使用，敬请安心。¤As for the ''Reverse Heaven Creation Technique'', according to Little {shidi}'s description it should be up to Master to decide whether to use it or not, so please feel at ease.
血剑宫？师父和{shidi}的分析倒是不无道理...¤Blood Sword Palace? Master and {shidi}'s analysis is not unreasonable...
也好，那此事便交给{shidi}了。雷劫到来前，我会再让阿欣通知你的。¤It is also good, then the matter will be left to {shidi}. I will ask Xin to inform you again before the thunderclap arrives.
这{$heishou}当年没能夺得魔剑，恐怕不会善罢甘休。此番师兄渡劫，可以算是他们最后的机会了。¤This {$heishou} failed to capture the demonic sword back then, and I'm afraid that they will not rest in peace. This time when senior brother crosses the tribulation, it can be considered their last chance.
这件事就交给我吧，我正想和那些化神前辈结识一番。¤Leave this matter to me, I'm looking forward to meeting those senior Deity Transformation cultivators.
这些请帖留有我的神识印记，我会让阿欣带上这些请帖替我走上一趟，邀请他们前来观礼。¤These invitations have my divine imprint on them. I will ask Xin to take these invitations on a trip for me and invite them to come and watch the ceremony.
另外，玄道宗的混元子，竹山宗的明山散人，星宫的星凝宫主，离火门的火麒麟以及金虹剑派的白鹿真人。¤Also, the Mystic Dao Sect's Mixer, the Bamboo Mountain Sect's Ming Mountain Scatterer, the Star Palace's Star Condensation Palace Master, the Heavenly Fire Gate's Fire Qilin and the Radiant Sword Sect's White Deer Reality.
师祖，{FirstName}{xiongdi}来了¤Master, {FirstName}{xiongdi} is here
当年御剑门因我而湮坠，本就对你们这一众弟子怀愧在心。¤When the Royal Sword Sect fell because of me, I was ashamed of all of you disciples.
果然也是仙灵之气么...¤Is it really the aura of immortality too...
等等，两种秘术都要在他人渡劫时才能使用，那也就是说...¤Wait, both secret arts can only be used when someone else is crossing the tribulation, so that means...
如今弟子可是九州第一剑仙，区区雷劫我还不放在眼里！¤Now I'm the number one sword immortal in Kyushu, I don't even care about lightning tribulations!
但眼下当务之急是把握住替师父重塑肉身的机会，到时恐怕很难再同时防备魔门的袭击。¤But the immediate task at hand is to seize the opportunity to reshape the flesh for Master, when I fear that it will be difficult to defend against the attacks of the Demon Gate at the same time.
但白帝还是一转此前豪气干云的气势，言语都温和了许多。¤Still, the White Emperor turned from his previous bravado and was much gentler in his words.
当年我被血剑宫救下绝非巧合，他们来宁州的目的也一直都是为了寻找那几柄魔剑。¤It was no coincidence that I was saved by the Blood Sword Palace back then, and their purpose for coming to Ning Province had always been to find those magic swords.
无妨，我追查多年，也只是有了一些模糊的猜测。¤No matter, I have traced it for years and have only vague guesses.
不过既然要在渡劫时帮师父重塑肉身，那有些事情就不得不考虑了。¤However, since they were going to help their master reshape his physical body during the tribulation, there were some things that had to be considered.
{shidi}说的是，确实应当多多提防这{$heishou}¤What {shidi} says is that one should indeed be more wary of this {$heishou}
古神教？师父和{shidi}的分析倒是不无道理...¤The Ancient Gods? Master and {shidi}'s analysis is not unreasonable...
若不是师父当年将我领进门，这身修为还不知从何谈起，如今能有机会报答师父，我当然不会放过。是吧，小{shidi}？¤If it wasn't for Master leading me into the door back then, I wouldn't know where to start with this cultivation. Now that I have the opportunity to repay Master, I certainly won't let it go. Isn't that right, little {shidi}?
师兄的意思是...？¤What does senior mean...?
我与魔门交手多年，曾自创了一套荡魔剑诀，在与魔修对阵时或有奇效。今日便先授与{shidi}。¤I have fought with the demon clan for many years and have created my own set of demon-destroying sword techniques, which may work wonders when fighting against evil cultivators. Today, I will teach it to {shidi} first.
还没有...¤Not yet...
等等，这秘术需要在他人渡劫时才能使用，那也就是说...¤Wait a minute, this secret technique needs to be used when someone else is crossing the tribulation, so that means...
{FirstName}{shidi}，极阴三海一行可有收获？¤{FirstName}{shidi}, did you get anything from your trip to the Three Seas of Extreme Yin?
若是魔门来犯，他们也不会坐视不理。¤If the devil's clan came to attack, they would not sit idly by.
以{shidi}你如今在宁州的名声，若由你出面邀请或许会适得其反。¤With {shidi} your reputation in Ning Province today, it might be counterproductive if you were to step in and invite.
放心..我怎放得下心！¤Don't worry... I can't let it go!
无妨，这极阴三海的传说本就是虚无缥缈之事。索性这些年我也算有所收获，寻得了这本名为《造化逆天术》的秘术。¤It doesn't matter, the legend of the three seas of extreme yin is a nebulous thing. So I have gained something over the years and have found this secret art called ''The Art of Creation and Reversal of Heaven''.
如今想来，这般手段倒是与当年之事有几分相似...¤Now that I think about it, it's a bit similar to what happened back then...
时隔多年，为师能再见轩儿一面便已是高兴至极，若是为了复活我，又葬送了你的苦修，我...我...¤I would be happy to see Xuan'er again after so many years. If I were to bury your hard work in order to revive me, I... I... I...
当年我故意放出戮仙剑在白帝楼手中的消息，骗过了血剑宫与天魔道，却唯独被这古神教用魔神蛊渗透倪家长老的方式识破了。¤Back then, I deliberately released the news that the Immortal Executing Sword was in the hands of the White Emperor House to fool the Blood Sword Palace and the Heavenly Demon Dao, but I was the only one who was recognized by this Ancient God Sect for infiltrating the Ni family elders with the Demon God Compulsion.
以上五人或是与我私交甚密，或是与魔门留有旧怨，我有十足把握他们不会拒绝。¤The above five people are either close personal friends of mine or have old grudges with the Demon Gate, and I am absolutely certain that they will not refuse.
不过我这秘术其他方面又有些不同。¤But there are other aspects of my secret art that are a little different.
也是？难道师兄在另一处获得秘法也需要仙灵之气？¤Also? Could it be that Senior Brother also needs Immortal Spirit Qi to obtain the Secret Technique in another place?
此事还是让阿欣走一遭吧。待时机成熟之后，我会让阿欣通知你的。¤It would be better to let Xin walk through this matter. When the time is right, I will ask Xin to inform you.
原本我想借此番渡劫引魔出动，与那玄道宗的混元子长老一起将来犯的魔门一网打尽。¤Originally, I wanted to use this tribulation to draw the devils out, and together with the Mystic Dao Sect's Elder Mixed Yuanzi, we would have wiped out the incoming devils.
听{shidi}的描述，这《逆天造化术》需要被复活者自主看准机会驱动。而我所获得的《造化逆天术》将主动权放在渡劫者手里，需由渡劫者驱动秘术，从而利用仙灵之气为被复活者重铸肉身。¤From the description of {shidi}, this ''Reverse Heaven Creation Art'' needs to be driven by the resurrected person who sees the opportunity to do so on their own. In contrast, the ''Reverse Heaven Creation Technique'' that I have obtained places the initiative in the hands of the transmigrator, who needs to drive the secret technique, thus using the immortal spirit energy to recast the physical body for the resurrected person.
不错，这《造化逆天术》的原理乃是利用他人飞升渡劫时引动的仙灵之气重铸肉身。¤It is true that the principle of this ''Creation Against Heaven Technique'' is to use the immortal spirit qi induced by others during their ascension and tribulation to recast their physical bodies.
天魔道？这倒是我未曾想到的...¤The Heavenly Demon Path? That's something I hadn't thought of...
嗯，我本就准备在不久之后渡飞升之劫，所以师父不需担心，不会让你等太久的。¤Well, I was already planning to cross the Ascension Tribulation soon, so there is no need to worry, Master, I won't keep you waiting for long.
我顺利得到一种名为《逆天造化术》的秘术，据言可以为灵魂体塑造一具与生前一般无二的肉体。¤I have successfully obtained a secret art called the ''Reverse Heaven Creation Art'', which is said to be able to create a physical body for the soul body that is as good as the one it was in life.
如若真是事不可为，弟子将主动停下《造化逆天术》的运转，专心应对雷劫。¤If it is really impossible to do so, the disciple will voluntarily stop the operation of the ''Creation and Reversal Technique'' and concentrate on the lightning tribulation.
师傅，放心吧。¤Don't worry, Master.
魏无极说到此处竟是哽咽起来，只是那灵魂之体未能随着他的心情变化相应地凝结出泪光，倒让这份情绪显得不那么真切。¤Wei Wuji actually choked up when he said this, but his soul body failed to condense tears in response to his mood, making the emotion seem less genuine.
{vpunch=10,0.5}胡闹！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Nonsense!
我对抗魔门多年，与天魔道血剑宫都结下深仇。再加上此前早已放出戮仙剑在我手中的传闻，这些魔门必然不会放过我渡劫飞升时这个最后的机会。¤I have fought against the Demon Sects for many years and have formed deep feuds with both the Demonic Sword Palace. Coupled with the rumour that the Immortal Executing Sword was in my hands, which had been released long before, these demon sects would certainly not let go of this last chance when I ascended through the tribulation.
唉，你这孩子，还是一点没变。嘴上是这么说的，但你心里在想什么难道我还不知道么。¤You're a child, you haven't changed a bit. You say that, but don't I know what's in your heart?
哈哈哈哈，{shidi}嘴上这么说，但出海寻找秘术可是未见迟疑。¤Hahahahaha, {shidi} said so, but there was no hesitation in going to sea to find the secret art.
造化逆天术？¤Creation Against the World?
嗯，我获得的秘法与{shidi}寻来的虽有些不同，但究其根本却是一致的。眼下除非还能寻到其他秘术，不然仙灵之气恐怕是不可或缺了。¤Well, the secret techniques I obtained are a little different from the ones {shidi} found, but the fundamentals are the same. Now, unless I can find another secret technique, I am afraid that the Qi of Immortal Spirits is indispensable.
此前为了调查当年御剑门之事，我也一直在留意这些魔门的动向。¤Previously, in order to investigate the matter of the Imperial Sword Sect back then, I had also been keeping an eye on the movements of these demon sects.
可惜时隔太久，还是没能弄清当年的真相...¤Unfortunately, too much time has passed and the truth about what happened back then is still not clear...
哈哈哈哈，看来我与{shidi}所见略同啊。¤Hahahahaha, looks like I see the same thing as {shidi}.
你们俩有这心就够了，但为我这老不死的冒险，真不值得。¤It's enough that you two have the heart for it, but it's really not worth risking it for an old man like me.
只是使用条件有些苛刻，需在他人渡雷劫之时于一旁引动仙灵之气重铸身体。¤However, the conditions for use are somewhat harsh, as it requires the re-casting of the body by drawing immortal spirit energy from the sidelines while another person is undergoing a lightning tribulation.
魏无极叹了口气，嘟囔了一句什么便回到剑中去了。¤Wei Wuji sighed, muttered something and went back to his sword.
此前为了调查当年御剑门之事，我也一直在留意这些魔门的动向，如今倒是有了一些新的理解。¤Previously, in order to investigate the matter of the Imperial Sword Sect back then, I had also been keeping an eye on the movements of these demon sects, and now I have some new understanding.
{vpunch=10,0.5}飞升渡劫本就万分困难，稍有不慎便会让你千百年的苦修白费！岂能将之当做儿戏！¤{The ascension to the next level is extremely difficult, and the slightest mistake can make your centuries of training go to waste! You can't treat it like a child's play!
不过这些年天魔道确实一直蠢蠢欲动，与宁州的不少势力都有所勾结。当年或许也是他们用这种手段挑拨了五派与御剑门的关系吧。¤But it is true that the Heavenly Demon Dao has been foolish over the years, and has colluded with many forces in Ning Province. Back then, perhaps they were also the ones who used such tactics to provoke the relationship between the five sects and the Imperial Sword Sect.
那{shidi}先做好准备吧，待时机成熟，我会让阿欣通知你的。¤Then {shidi} get ready first, and when the time is right, I'll ask Xin to let you know.
我们骨材铺专售各类妖兽牙，骨，外壳类材料。道友看看有什么需要的？¤Our bone material shop specializes in selling all kinds of monster teeth, bones, and shell materials. Friends, see what you need?
我看方才那异象八成是三阳玄火造成的，若无万全准备你千万不可冒险。¤I think that 80% of the vision just now was caused by the Sanyang Xuanhuo. You must not take risks unless you are fully prepared.
既是至阳至盛之物，自然可用极阴极寒之物中和。¤Since it is the most yang, the most prosperous thing, it can naturally be neutralized by the extreme cold.
他那功法取自三阳玄火，所谓三阳玄火乃是上古异火其一，在这九州大陆上极其难觅。当年他也不知得了什么机缘，竟在沃焦山熔岩深处发现一丝异火踪迹。¤His technique was taken from the Sanyang Xuanhuo. The so-called Sanyang Xuanhuo is one of the ancient different fires. It is extremely difficult to find on this Nine State Continent. He didn't know what chance he had, but he was in the depths of the lava of Inferno Mountain. A trace of strange fire was found.
竟如此危险...你可知如何才能令我接触那异火吗？¤It's so dangerous...Do you know how to expose me to that strange fire?
据那老小子形容，三阳玄火霸道无比，若非他有元婴修为还真奈何不得那异火几分。饶是如此，和三阳玄火斗争也去了他大半条命，连元神都被它吞了十之有一。¤According to the old boy, Sanyang Xuanhuo is extremely domineering. If he hadn’t had a Nascent Soul cultivation base, it wouldn’t have been a bit of a strange fire. For that matter, fighting against Sanyang Xuanhuo would have killed him for most of his life. The soul was swallowed by it one in ten.
做好准备后，再来挑战这三阳玄火应该就对你无恙了。¤After you are ready, challenge the Sanyang Xuanhuo again and it should be fine for you.
传闻无尽之海上有一种极阴冷火，若是修习过也许能有几分作用，其次也可服用极寒的雪玉骨参。除此之外，你的修为也不可低于金丹期，否则大罗金仙也救不了你。¤It is rumored that there is a kind of extremely cold fire on the endless sea. If you can wield it, it may protect you. Otherwise, you can also seek out the extremely cold Frostbone Ginseng. In addition, your cultivation level should not be lower than Golden Core. Otherwise even a True Golden Immortal will not be able to save you.
形势不妙啊。¤The situation is not good.
看情形，应该是某种禁制，看来这古神教一开始就没准备给他一条活路啊，既然来此，那就进去看看吧，就我感知里面已经没有活人了。¤Depending on the situation, it should be some kind of restriction. It seems that the ancient gods were not prepared to give him a way to survive from the beginning. Since he is here, let's go in and take a look. I feel that there are no living people inside.
就是我出来的地方，我体内被下了禁制，什么都不能乱动，他们留给我的丹药就要吃完了，还好你救了我。¤That's where I came out, I was put under a ban inside me, nothing could be moved, the potion they left me was about to run out, luckily you saved me.
还有？....对了，期间还有一个长老来过，他被那个护法叫做天邪子，也带了一队人马，好像在追杀一个叛徒，不过很快就走了。¤And? .... By the way, there was another elder who came during the period, he was called by that guardian called the Heavenly Evil Son, also brought a team of people, seems to be hunting a traitor, but soon left.
我都说了，放过我吧我也是迫....额...额.噗！！！！¤I said, let me go, I'm also forced... uh... uh. puff!!!
眼前之人，七窍流血，已经气绝。¤The person in front of you is bleeding from Qi orifices, already breathless.
对，对，那个领头的，别人都叫他护法，不过他包的的严实，也不知是男是女。¤Yes, yes, the person leading, the others call him Guardian, but he's so tightly wrapped that I don't know if he's a man or a woman.
说，但有隐瞒，送你上路！¤Say, but there is a concealment, I will send you on the road!
老头，你知道这是怎么了吗?¤Old man, do you know what's wrong?
别~别杀我！！¤Don't ~ don't kill me!!
我本是化尘教一普通的外门弟子自此巡逻，被他们制服之后种下了魔神蛊。他们威胁我，我迫不得已才为他们打掩护，他们就在此做了藏身地。后来他们好像有什么要事，就把我关在里面了。¤I was originally an ordinary outer disciple of the Aeonic Sands Temple on patrol since then. After being subdued by them, I planted the Devil God Gu. They threatened me, and I had no choice but to cover for them, and they made a hiding place here. Later they became a hiding place. It seemed that there was something important, so I was locked in.
无尽之海上也如同宁州一般，有着自己的势力划分。其中最大的城池竟由三大势力共同掌管，真是前所未闻。¤The Endless Sea is also like Ning Province, with its own division of power. The largest city among them is jointly controlled by the three powers, which is really unheard of.
这小妖也不过如此嘛，回去复命吧。¤This little demon is nothing more than that, go back and report.
不自量力之辈，回去复命吧。¤For those of you who are overpowered, go back and get your life back.
这妖兽好厉害，先回去复命吧。¤This monster is so powerful, let's go back to life first.
对方打晕了你，速速离去。¤The other party knocked you out and left quickly.
此人甚是厉害，先回去复命吧。¤This person is very powerful, let's go back and return first.
道友，走的这么急，应该是找到好东西了吧。¤Fellow Daoist, walking in such a hurry, you should have found something good.
想要我手里的东西，那得看看你有没有这个本事！¤Wanna take something of mine? Then let see what you're capable of!
你收敛气息，快速找了一个隐秘之处躲藏起来。不多时，便有一道遁光从洞口闪过。¤You reduced your breath and quickly found a hidden place to hide. After a while, a light flashed from the entrance of the cave.
紧急关头，你来不及多想，一个瞬身便闪入洞窟。将那两株{SayStcVal=948}收入囊中！¤In an emergency, you have no time to think about it, and one instant flashes into the cave. Put those two {SayStcVal=948} into the bag!
道友，在下此番出海正是为了寻这{SayStcVal=948}。我无意与道友冲突，但若道友愿意出让的话，我愿意花灵石买下这两株草药，不知道友意下如何？¤Friends of Daoism, I am going to sea this time just to find this {SayStcVal=948}. I have no intention of conflicting with fellow Daoists, but if fellow Daoists are willing to sell, I am willing to buy these two herbs from Hualingshi. I don’t know what you’re interested in. How about next?
所谓见者有份，我也不是什么贪心之人。这两株{SayStcVal=948}你若能分我一株，我便放你从这里离开。否则要是动起手来，再惊动了更多的人，道友怕是连剩下的这一株也得不到了。¤I am not a greedy person if I have a share of the people who see me. If you can divide me with these two {SayStcVal=948}, I will let you go from here. Otherwise, if you start your hands, I will be more alarmed. For many people, fellow Taoists may not even get the remaining strain.
他脸上的表情阴晴变换，似乎是在衡量你的实力。一番纠结后，他很不情愿地将一株草药抛给了你，然后飞快地离开了。¤The cloudy and sunny expression on his face seems to be a measure of your strength. After some entanglement, he reluctantly threw a herbal medicine to you, and then left quickly.
你收敛气息，慢慢走进洞窟..你刚才摘下草药，突然汗毛倒立，回头一看，一个人影竟不知何时出现在了你的身后。¤You restrained your breath and walked slowly into the cave... You just took off the herbs, and suddenly your hairs stand upside down. When you look back, you don't know when a figure appeared behind you.
此人的衣着与遁术看起来都颇为眼熟，也许和你一样是来自宁州的修士。你决定...？¤This person's clothes and escape skills look familiar. Maybe he is a cultivator from Ning Province just like you. You decide...?
我无意与道友冲突，若道友愿意出让的话，我愿意以5万灵石的价格买下这两株草药，不知道友意下如何？¤I have no intention of conflicting with fellow daoists. If fellow daoists are willing to sell, I am willing to buy these two herbs at the price of 50,000 spiritual stones. I don't know what will happen to the friends?
哼，想要我手里的东西，那得看看你有没有这个本事！¤Hmph, if you want something in my hand, you have to see if you have this ability!
嘿，能屈能伸，倒也是个人物，本座记住你了。¤Hey, being able to bend and stretch is also a character, I remember you.
此人衣着与身法中处处透露着诡异，与常人大为不同，更像是魔道法门。这些魔门修士实力难以预测，通常还会有一些与人玉石俱焚的危险招收，实在不好对付。你决定...？¤This person's clothes and body style reveal weirdness everywhere, which is very different from ordinary people, more like a magic method. The strength of these evil cultivators is unpredictable, and there are usually some dangerous recruits that burn with jade, which is really difficult to deal with. You decide...?
此等品阶的草药实乃可遇而不可求之物，可惜神识笼罩范围内，另有一人的气息也正在朝此处靠近。你决定...？{w}{w=0.5}¤Herbs of this grade are really something that can be encountered but cannot be sought. It is a pity that within the scope of the divine consciousness, the breath of another person is also approaching here. You decide...?{w}{w=0.5}
若是寻常宝贝便算了，像{SayStcVal=948}这样可遇不可求的草药，在下可不能眼睁睁地看着道友独吞了他。¤If it's an ordinary treasure, forget it, like {SayStcVal=948}, you can't find herbs like {SayStcVal=948}. You can't just watch the Taoist friends swallow him.
哈哈哈，那便多谢道友了。¤Hahaha, thank you fellow Taoist then.
本座今日心情不错，把东西留下，我便饶你一条性命。¤I am in a good mood today, leave things behind and I will spare you my life.
那人距离此地尚有一段距离，若你抢先一步动手，应该有办法在他之前夺得此宝。¤That person is still some distance away. If you take the first step, there should be a way to win this treasure before him.
...你是何人？¤...Who are you?
很好，现在它们归你了。¤Very well, now they belong to you.
你身法轻灵，仅仅一息之间便带着草药扬长而去，顺利的避开了这场冲突。¤You are light and agile, and you took the herbs and left in just a breath, avoiding this conflict smoothly.
这两株草药对我来说也很重要，即便送去拍卖行也是价格不菲。¤These two herbs are also very important to me, even if they are sent to the auction house, they are expensive.
道友，在下是来自{$MP}的修士，此番出海正是为了寻这{SayStcVal=948}。¤Fellow Daoist, next is a cultivator from {$MP}. This time I went to sea to find this {SayStcVal=948}.
滚吧，趁本座还没有改主意之前，赶紧从我面前消失。¤Go away, before I change my mind, quickly disappear from me.
口气倒是不小，那就看看你到底有几分本事吧。¤The tone is not small, let's see how good you are.
哈哈哈哈，果然是这{SayStcVal=948}。¤Hahahaha, it really is {SayStcVal=948}.
从他的身法与衣着中，不难看出此人是来自碎星商会的修士。碎星商会在无尽之海中颇有势力，你决定...？¤From his body style and clothes, it is not difficult to see that this person is a cultivator from the Broken Star Merchant Guild. The Broken Star Merchant Guild is quite powerful in the endless sea, you decide...?
不过你若是愿意出上7万灵石的价格，倒也不是不能考虑。¤But if you are willing to pay the price of 70 thousand spirit stones, it is not impossible to consider it.
你刚走出洞窟，正准备扬长而去，只见一道遁光闪到你的身前...¤You have just walked out of the cave, and you are about to go away, only to see a light flashing in front of you...
从他的身法与衣着中，不难看出此人是来自蓬莎岛的修士。蓬莎岛在无尽之海中颇有势力，你决定...？¤From his body style and clothes, it is not difficult to see that this person is a cultivator from Pongsha Island. Punsha Island is quite powerful in the endless sea, you decide...?
一定是我的丹药还不够完美，青嫣才会拒绝我......¤It must be that my pill is not perfect enough for Qing Yan to reject me...
与其碌碌度日，徐兄不妨想想青嫣走前对你说的话。¤Rather than staying busy, Brother Xu might as well think about what Qing Yan said to you before leaving.
这辈子还没过完就开始指望下辈子，你真是病入膏肓。¤You start to count on the next life before this life is over. You are really dying.
你不愿再与他多费口舌，收起法宝便向山洞外走去。¤You don't want to bother with him anymore, put away the magic weapon and walk out of the cave.
你本以为他终于想开打算重振旗鼓努力修炼，没想到他在原地摆出丹炉开始了新一轮的炼丹。¤You thought he finally wanted to revive his spirit and work hard to cultivate, but he didn't expect him to start a new round of alchemy with the pill furnace on the spot.
徐凡把剑一扔，直接一屁股坐在了地上。¤Xu Fan threw the sword and sat down on the ground.
你叹了口气，看来是没办法将此人从自己的世界中拉出来了。¤You sighed, it seems there is no way to pull this person out of your world.
反正我是废物，修炼是，炼丹也是。倒不如趁早一了百了，下辈子再圆此长生梦。¤Anyway, I'm a waste, cultivation is, and alchemy is also. It's better to have a hundred as early as possible, and then realize this longevity dream in the next life.
我当是什么少年豪杰......水平也不过如此。¤I think I am a young hero...the level is no more than that.
就这两下子还敢质疑我与青嫣的感情，也不问问自己配不配？¤Dare to question the relationship between me and Qing Yan, even if I am worthy?
徐凡打赢了你，看起来心情似乎好了许多。¤Xu Fan has beaten you, and it seems that he is in a much better mood.
道友你好，天星城中出现了些变故，现已封城。林家与星宫的联姻也被推迟。若无要事，还请前往天星城客栈休息几天，待解封之后再自行离去。¤Hello, fellow Daoist, there have been some changes in the Heavenly Star City and the city is now closed. The marriage between the Lin family and the Star Palace has also been postponed. If there is nothing important, please go to the Heavenly Star City Inn to rest for a few days, and then leave on your own after the seal is lifted.
{FirstName}道友原来你在这里。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName}, you are here.
林姑娘可知大概需封城多久？如无必要，我还是不想在天星城内耽搁太久。¤Miss Lin know about how long it takes to seal the city? If there is no need, I still do not want to delay too long in the sky star city.
即是如此，那我便先行前往客栈了。¤That is the case, then I will go to the inn first.
多谢道友告知。既然如此，我便先行前往客栈了。¤Thank you for telling us. In that case, I will go to the inn first.
林姑娘可是找我有事？¤I'm not sure if I'm the only one who's looking for you.
嗯...天星城中出现了些变故，现已封城，{daoyou}若无要事急需离去，还请在客栈中休息几天。当然，在此期间客栈所有费用将由林家负责。¤Hmm... There have been some changes in Tianxing City, and the city is now closed. If {daoyou} needs to leave urgently, please rest in the inn for a few days. Of course, the Lin family will be responsible for all expenses of the inn during this period.
作为补偿，封城期间客栈的所有费用都将由林家支付。¤As compensation, all expenses of the inn during the city Cultivate will be paid by the Lin family.
嗯...应该只需一两天便是会解封，不会耽搁{FirstName}道友太久。¤Hmm... It should only take a day or two to unblock, it won't delay fellow Taoist {FirstName} for too long.
对方剑光直刺你的面门。¤The opponent's sword light pierced your face.
完了...¤It's over...
这是？还是拿回白帝楼吧。¤Is this? Take it back to the Baidi Building.
死！！¤dead!!
呼~这人若不是受了伤，还真是不好对付。¤Huh~ If this person is not injured, it is really hard to deal with.
小友勇气可嘉，但这祭血使不是你能处理的，以后还要小心行事。¤The courage of the little friend is commendable, but this sacrificial envoy is not something you can handle. You have to be careful in the future.
{SayStcVal=927}，有什么事么？{w}{w=0.5}¤{SayStcVal=927}, what's the matter? {w}{w=0.5}
你能感知到，对方是{SayStcVal=921}修士。你决定...{w}{w=0.5}¤You can perceive that the other party is a {SayStcVal=921} cultivator. You decide...{w}{w=0.5}
对方{SayStcVal=920}地站在原地，似乎先等你离开。¤The other party {SayStcVal=920} stands in place, as if waiting for you to leave first.

前辈走好。¤Senior go well.
{SayStcVal=927}，有事？{w}{w=0.5}¤{SayStcVal=927}, something?{w}{w=0.5}
对方似乎是{SayStcVal=920}修士，见到你过来，停下来{SayStcVal=923}地看着你。你决定...{w}{w=0.5}¤The other party seems to be a cultivator {SayStcVal=920}. Seeing you come over, stop {SayStcVal=923} and look at you. You decide...{w}{w=0.5}
对方面无表情地转身离开。¤The other side turned and left without expression.
{shixiong}，慢走。¤{shixiong}, go slowly.
{SayStcVal=927}，可有吩咐？{w}{w=0.5}¤{SayStcVal=927}, is there any order? {w}{w=0.5}
对方向你点头示意。¤You nod to the direction.

还请手下留情。¤Please be merciful.
可有什么宝贝，不如我们交易一番。¤But what's the treasure, it's better for us to trade.
哦？{FirstName}{LastName}，有什么事？¤Oh? {FirstName}{LastName}, what's the matter?
前辈我先告辞了。¤Senior, I'll leave first.
你一剑击散了玄机真人的元婴，伴随着玄机真人的身死，威压渐渐散去，但地宫深处传来的煞气却愈发浓烈起来。¤You smashed the Nascent Soul of Mysterious Man with a single sword. With the death of Mysterious Man, the coercion gradually dissipated, but the evil spirit from the depths of the underground palace grew stronger.
你来到高处眺望，城市的西面似乎是曾经的坊市集聚之地，如今已是一片废墟。东面还保留着不少的建筑，依稀可以辨认出它们万年前的模样。¤When you come to look at it from a high place, the west of the city seems to be the place where the squares once gathered, but it is now in ruins. There are still many buildings on the east, and you can vaguely recognize their appearance thousands of years ago.
古原城很大，想必万年以前修真者们在此地集会交易，定然是一番盛世景象。只是如今，这座恢弘的大城只剩下了一片断壁残垣与无尽的死寂。¤The ancient city is very big. It must be a prosperous scene for the cultivators to gather and trade here ten thousand years ago. But now, this magnificent city is left with only a fragment of ruined walls and endless silence.
最显眼的则是城市北面的那座巨大的建筑，大小与天星城的星宫相仿，不知当年是何作用。¤The most conspicuous thing is the huge building on the north side of the city. It is similar in size to the Star Palace in the Star City. I don't know what it did back then.
总的来说，炼器是一门将不同五维特性、不同阴阳属性、不同五行属性的材料融合在一起成器的法门，需通过挑选并搭配不同材料以获得想要的效果特性。¤In a nutshell, smithing is a method of blending materials with different five dimensional characteristics, different yin and yang attributes and different five elements to form a weapon, by selecting and matching different materials to obtain the desired characteristics.
本店售卖武器较多，有些武器本身便杀伤力十足，有些则用于给修士带来增益状态。¤The shop sells a wide range of weapons, some of which are lethal in their own right and some of which are used to give the cultivator a beneficial status.
世间材料皆有五种属性：灵力亲和、灵力操控、灵性、坚固、坚韧；不同类型的材料，其五种属性各有高低。¤All materials in the world have five attributes: spiritual affinity, spiritual manipulation, spirituality, strength and toughness; the five attributes are different for different types of materials.
而即便是同一等级的法宝，由于其韧性，操控，灵性等五维属性不同，通常又会分成上中下品不等，售卖时的价位也差距很大。¤Even if they are of the same grade, they are usually divided into upper, middle and lower grades due to their different five-dimensional attributes such as toughness, handling and spirituality, and they are sold at a wide range of prices.
请教不敢当，我对于炼器也只了解一些皮毛罢了。不过见过的法宝多，对于它的好坏倒是有一套判断的方法。¤I don't dare to ask for advice, I only know a little bit about smithing. But I have seen a lot of magic treasures, for its good or bad is a set of methods to judge.
但真要说用起来趁不趁手，也还得看法宝与自身功法、神通的搭配。至于客官要哪件装备，一会儿可以根据自身情况慢慢挑选。¤However, it really depends on how well the magic treasure matches your own techniques and divine abilities. As for which piece of equipment you want, you can take your time to choose according to your own situation.
而这砺剑匣，本身倒是没有什么杀伤力，但是与御剑术搭配就十分合适。¤The sword sharpening box, on the other hand, is not very lethal by itself, but it fits perfectly with the Imperial Sword Technique.
法宝自然是品阶越高越是强力，客官要是手头阔绰，便可以挑些法器甚至是法宝级别的装备。¤Naturally, the higher the grade of the magic weapon, the more powerful it is, so if you have a lot of money, you can pick up some magic weapons or even magic treasure level equipment.
世间材料皆分五行，五行相生的材料自然可以融合成器，但材料之中若是五行相克就需要五行相合的炼器手法才能成器。¤The materials in this world are all divided into five elements, and those that are compatible with each other can naturally be fused to form a weapon, but if the materials are compatible with each other, a refining technique that combines the five elements is required to form a weapon.
再深入的道理小的就不明白了，不过要提醒客官一句，炼器之道也颇为危险，领悟的不够精深就难以驾驭炼制高阶法宝，若强行炼制可能造成器胚爆炸伤及自身。¤I don't understand any more, but I would like to remind you that the path of refining is also quite dangerous, if you don't understand it well enough, it is difficult to master refining high level magic treasures, and if you force it, you may cause the embryo to explode and hurt yourself.
用不同阴阳、五行的材料炼制而成的同种武器，会具有不同的效果特性，而用同一组材料在炼制不同武器的时候也会呈现不同特性。¤The same weapon refined from materials of different yin and yang and five elements will have different effect characteristics, and the same set of materials will also exhibit different characteristics when refined from different weapons.
比如我们这儿的火麟环，可用于灼烧对手，在善于火系功法的修士之间就有不错的销路。¤For example, our Fire Forest Ring here can be used to scorch opponents and has a good sale among cultivators who are good at fire-based techniques.
防具大多会通过释放灵力护罩来保护修士，饰品则能提供特殊的防御效果。¤Defence gear will mostly protect the cultivator by releasing a spiritual shield, while trinkets provide special defensive effects.
客官可以防具、饰品各选一样，一同使用效果最佳。¤Guests can choose one of each of the defence and accessories and use them together for best results.
材料会提供灵力，凝聚足够的灵力便能产生对应的效果特性，灵力越多，效果越强力。¤The material will provide the spirit power, and if you gather enough spirit power, you will be able to create the corresponding effect characteristics, the more spirit power, the more powerful the effect.
世间材料皆分天阳、地阴。同种五行属性不同种阴阳表现的效果也会不同，若要追求极致，通常在选材上应注重极阴、极阳。¤All materials in the world are divided into heavenly yang and earthly yin. Different yin and yang of the same five elements will have different effects. If you want to pursue the ultimate, you should usually focus on extreme yin and extreme yang in the selection of materials.
当然，除此之外还有不少效果甚好的武器，小的在此只是列举一二。¤There are, of course, many other weapons that are very effective, and I am only listing a few of them here.
想必客官清楚，法宝的品质由低到高分为符器、法器、法宝、纯阳法宝和通天灵宝五个等级。¤I'm sure the guest is well aware that the quality of magic treasures is divided into five grades from low to high: talisman weapon, magic weapon, magic treasure, pure Yang magic treasure and heavenly spiritual treasure.
修士道袍是最基础也是卖得最好的，再好点儿的，护体法袍也卖得不错。¤The cultivator's daoist robe is the most basic and best-selling, while the better ones, the body robes, also sell well.
客官如果想自行炼器，我这里正好有一本{color=#d0380a}《炼器入门》{/color}，领悟之后便能初窥炼器之门径，掌握基本的炼器手法，然后便能开始着手炼器了。客官想要的话，花上500灵石就行。¤If you want to refine your own weapons, I have a copy of {color=#d0380a}''Introduction to Weaponry Refinement''{/color}. After understanding it, you can get a first glimpse of weaponry refinement and master the basic refinement techniques, and then you can start refining. If you want it, just spend 500 spirit stones.
在炼制法宝时，若有一项属性为零则不能成器，同样五维各项越高越好，越能把灵力发挥到极致。¤When making a magic treasure, if one of the attributes is zero, it will not become a weapon. Similarly, the higher the five dimensions, the better it is, and the more you can bring your spiritual power to the fore.
那客官您...要不看看其它的。¤So, sir, you... Why don't you take a look at the others.
客官您慢慢挑选。¤Take your time to choose, sir.
算了，我暂时还没有学习炼器的打算。¤Forget it, I have no intention of learning to smith for now.
好嘞！本店售卖武器、防具、饰品，客官想了解哪一类呢？¤Yes! We sell weapons, defensive gear and accessories, which category would you like to know about?
但是只要手法熟练、搭配合适，阴阳混搭也可以炼出上好的法宝。¤But with skill and the right combination, a mixture of yin and yang can also produce a good magic weapon.
就算是苟活，那也比死了好。¤Even if you live, it's better than dying.
只见他朝一个洞府入口跑去，却不知撞上了什么禁制，被硬生生弹了回来，摔倒在地上。¤He was seen running towards a cave entrance, but he didn't know what kind of ban he had hit and was bounced back hard, falling to the ground.
枯木老祖面色一阵铁青，说话的声音也变得颤颤巍巍起来。¤The old man's face turned iron for a moment, and his voice became trembling as he spoke.
洞府中传来一股深不可测的声音，仿佛仅听这声音，你的神识便受到了触动，这使你瞬间警觉了起来。¤An unfathomable sound comes from the cave, as if your soul sense is touched by just hearing this sound, which makes you instantly alert.
明山…明山！¤Mingshan...Mingshan!
你一路追了过来，不难看出他的速度已经越来越慢，遁术的效果似乎已经消退殆尽。¤You have chased him all the way here, and it is easy to see that he has been getting slower and slower, and that the effect of the evasion technique seems to have faded away.
看来太上长老并不想帮你，你也该为自己的所作所为付出代价了。¤It seems that the Supreme Elder does not want to help you and it is time for you to pay for what you have done.
明山，你对我见死不救，难道不怕被心魔困扰吗？¤Ming Shan, aren't you afraid of being haunted by the demons of your mind if you don't save me from death?
那…一直以来你都没对我们出手，难道不是因为念及旧情？¤So...all this time you haven't struck out at us, isn't it because you're thinking of old times?
神秘声音：若你当初听我一劝，不去修那枯木功，也不至于变成现在这副摸样。¤Mysterious voice: If you had listened to my advice and not practised that Deadwood technique, you would not have become what you are now.
我要是不修枯木功，早就死了！！¤If I didn't practice the Deadwood technique, I would have died long ago!!!
你资质极佳，如今已是化神修为，只会站在顶点俯瞰众生，哪里知道我这几百年来盘算着寿元度日的辛苦？¤You have excellent qualifications and are now a Deity Transformation, you will only stand at the top and look down on all beings, so how can you know how hard I have worked these past few hundred years counting my life span?
你…你当真不念旧情？当年你熟识的人当中，可就只有我还活着了…¤You...you really don't care about old times? I'm the only one of your acquaintances who is still alive...
可当年我们天魔眼中共同杀敌的时候你便说过，绝不会对我见死不救的！¤But back when we killed together in the eyes of the devil, you said you would never leave me to die!
神秘声音：你修那枯木功，破坏了对灵气的感知，便已与结婴无缘，只是苟活于世罢了。¤Mysterious voice: You have destroyed your perception of spiritual energy by practicing the Dead Wood technique.
枯木老祖就像溺水的人拼命想抓住救命稻草一般，敲打着禁制。此情此景被你看在眼里，不禁觉得有些好笑。¤Like a drowning man desperately trying to grab a life-saving straw, the old man of the dead wood knocked at the ban. This scene is seen by you and you can't help but feel a little funny.
他用干枯的喉咙喊出嘶哑的声音。你能感受到，洞府内那位实力定然非同小可。¤He shouted a hoarse voice with a parched throat. You can sense that the one inside the cave must be of great strength.
枯木老祖开始气急败坏起来。¤The old Kuki ancestor began to get furious.
明山，救我！¤Ming Shan, help me!
面对枯木老祖的求情，洞府内并没有回应。¤There was no response from inside the cave in the face of the plea from the old man of the dead wood.
可是我想活！！！！¤But I want to live!!!!
神秘声音：化神并不是顶点，若是渡劫失败，我同样也只是虚度千载而已。我们所能做的，只有坚守自己的道，并一直走到最后罢了。¤Mysterious voice: Deity Transformation is not the pinnacle, and if I fail to cross the tribulation, I will also just spend a thousand years in vain. All we can do is stick to our own path and go all the way to the end.
看来你师兄并不想帮你，你也该为自己的所作所为付出代价了。¤It seems that your brother does not want to help you and it is time for you to pay for what you have done.
见此情形，你没有贸然出手，只是在一旁静观事态发展。¤Seeing this, you do not make a rash move, but simply stand by and watch the situation unfold.
神秘声音：当年...¤Mysterious voices: back in the day...
半晌，也许是累了，也许是明白了什么，枯木老祖不再发问，只是缓缓转过身，眼神空洞。¤Halfway through the day, perhaps tired, perhaps understanding something, the old man of Deadwood stopped asking questions and just slowly turned around, his eyes hollow.
神秘声音：心魔？你以金丹修为活过千载，本就是逆天而行。如今命数已尽，不过是顺应天道而已，我又怎会生出心魔？¤Mysterious voice: A heart demon? You have lived for a thousand years with your Golden Core cultivation, and you have acted against the heavens. Now that your destiny has ended, you are only following the path of Heaven, so how can I have a demon in my heart?
你的第二个灵根属性是？¤What is your second spiritual root attribute?
老夫已为你重置了化神领域。¤I have reset the Deity Transformation Domain for you.
你的第三个灵根属性是？¤What is your third spiritual root attribute?
老夫已为你重置了悟道天赋。¤The old man has reset the enlightenment talent for you.
你希望现在的化神领域是？¤What would you like your Deity Transformation Domain to be?
你的第一个灵根属性是？¤What is your first spiritual root attribute?
你的灵根属性是？¤What is your spiritual root attribute?
你希望现在的灵根资质是？¤What do you hope your spiritual root aptitude is now?
老夫已为你重置了灵根的属性。¤The old man has reset the attributes of the spirit root for you.
找到了找到了...！¤I found it...!
这大蛇合你我之力恐怕难伤其分毫，幸好我这里还留了张我爹给的传送符。¤This big snake can harm you and mine. Fortunately, I still have a teleportation talisman given by my father.
虽然传送到哪里我也不太确定...但总比现在的情况要好吧！¤Although I'm not sure where it will be transmitted...but it's better than it is now!
你只感到一只手搭上你的左肩，下一瞬间已是天旋地转。¤You only feel a hand on your left shoulder, the next moment the sky is spinning.
倪旭欣也不避讳，当着你的面掐了几个复杂的手诀，口中念念有词。¤Ni XuXin didn't shy away, she pinched a few complicated maneuvers in front of you, and said something in her mouth.
不远处传来一阵激烈的灵气波动。为了一探究竟，你收敛气息潜了过去。¤A fierce aura fluctuation comes from not far away. To find out, you gather your breath and dive over.
在距你不过数丈之远的地方，那异种魔狠狠地将师妹撞倒在地，眼看下一招便要致其于死地。¤Only a few feet away from you, the fae demon ruthlessly knocked his sister to the ground, looking like he would kill her with his next move.
你趁迅疾异种魔不备，向其攻了过去。¤You attack the swift fae demon while it is unprepared.
那异种魔飞快地冲了上前，直奔逃跑的师妹。那师妹本就负伤，哪能跑过迅疾异种魔？¤The fae demon dashed forward and ran straight for the fleeing sister. The sister was already wounded, so how could she outrun the swift Fae demon?
若是寻常筑基修士，一人对峙一只异种魔已是极限，他一人牵制两只异种魔，竟还能分神照顾师妹，真是不简单。¤If it were an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator, one person against one Fae demon would be the limit, but he was holding two Fae demons alone, and he could still distract himself from taking care of his sister.
你不想受到牵连，趁他们打的不可开交之时，敛息偷偷离开了。¤You didn't want to be implicated, so you took advantage of their fight to sneak away.
根本来不及多想，那名师妹朝你所在的方向跑了过来。¤There's no time to think about it at all, as the sis runs in the direction you are.
忍住。¤Hold back.
啊——¤Ahhh...
而就在这数息时间，迅疾异种魔便挣脱了束缚。¤And in just those few breaths, the Swift Fae Demon broke free of its bonds.
事态发展远远超出了你的预料，那师兄露出了难以置信的神情，硬是愣了数息时间。¤Things have developed far beyond your expectations, and that senior brother revealed a look of disbelief and froze hard for several breaths of time.
虽说强行避开了要害，但她的后背还是被撕开了三道血淋淋的伤口。¤Although she forced herself to avoid the vitals, her back was still torn open with three bloody wounds.
一只自愈能力极强的异种魔竟不顾自身缠绕，优先帮迅疾异种魔撕开了身上的藤曼。¤A self-healing Fae had made it a priority to help the Swift Fae rip the Vermillion off its body, despite its own entanglement.
而那位清秀修士一边操控藤曼的同时，当机立断，反手便将她拉开。¤And while the clean-cut cultivator was manipulating Vine Man, he made a split-second decision and pulled her away with his backhand.
只见那只迅疾异种魔身上莫名被腕粗的藤蔓缠绕，一时间行动严重受阻。¤The swift fae demon was inexplicably entangled in wrist-thick vines and its movement was severely hampered for a while.
师兄回过神来，施展神通打算重新控制住局面，但却是为时已晚。¤Brother came back to his senses and used his divine powers with the intention of regaining control of the situation, but it was too late.
快跑。¤Run.
可毕竟一个人的力量是有限的，在控制迅疾异种魔的同时，他对另外两只异种魔的控制自然便有了疏漏。¤But one man's power is limited, and while he controls the Swift Fae, his control over the other two Fae is naturally lax.
只见三只形态各异的异种魔，正在围攻穿着竹山宗服饰的二人。¤Only three Fae demons of different forms were seen besieging the duo wearing the costumes of the Bamboo Mountain Clan.
其中一人面容清秀，一人牵制二敌尚能气息沉稳，但另一人则不然，面对一只异种魔却早已手忙脚乱。¤One of them has a clear face, and one of them can hold two enemies with a steady breath, but the other one is not, and is already in a state of confusion when faced with a Fae demon.
也罢，便助你们一臂之力好了。¤So be it, let us help you.
原来那位师兄已提前运好驱藤术，趁异种魔进攻之时用藤曼将其牢牢缠住，提供了喘息之机。¤It turned out that that brother had already used the vine repelling technique in advance, using the vine man to entangle the fae demon firmly while it was attacking, providing a respite.
这时，其中一只异种魔陡然加速，攻向修为较弱的那位。其速度远超普通筑基修士，爪子眼看便要洞穿她的身体。¤At that moment, one of the fae demons steeply accelerated and attacked the one with the weaker cultivation level. Its speed far exceeded that of ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, and its claws were about to pierce through her body.
客房已经收拾好了，心儿你带{FirstName}小友过去吧。¤The guest room has been cleaned up, Xin'er, take the little friend {FirstName} over.
林沐心不耐烦地偏过头，一副你能拿我怎么办的模样。¤Lin Mu turned her head away impatiently, as if you could do with me.
林沐心悄悄地靠近你，告诉你这位是比较照顾她的大长老通羽上人。¤Lin Muxin approached you quietly, telling you that this is the Grand Elder, Lord Tong Yu, who always took good care of her.
心儿，不给我们介绍一下这位年轻人吗？¤Xin'er, don't you introduce this young man to us?
真是反了天了！¤It's really the opposite!
长老此言差矣，每个人都有自己的秘密，难不成什么都拿到明面上来才是大家之秀吗？¤The elder's words are bad. Everyone has their own secrets. Is it possible that everyone's show is to get everything on the surface?
是，栖云长老。这位是{FirstName}{LastName}道友。¤Yes, Elder Qiyun. This is fellow {FirstName}{LastName}.
昨日我在城外遇到了禾山道的邪修，多亏了{FirstName}道友出手相助，我才能活着回来。¤Yesterday, I met the evil cultivator of Heshan Dao outside the city. Thanks to the help of Daoist {FirstName}, I was able to come back alive.
（低声）这个是二长老苗矮上人，平日就他最爱找我麻烦。¤(Whispering) This is the second elder, Lord Miaoai, who loves to find problems with me.
（低声）刚刚说话的那位就是三长老栖云...¤(Whispering) The one who just spoke was the three elder Qiyun...
通羽长老听到林沐心的话善意地对你一笑，苗矮长老冷哼一声，一旁的栖云长老则审视地看着你。¤Elder Tong Yu smiled at you kindly when he heard Lin Muxin's words, Elder Miao Ai snorted coldly, and Elder Qiyun on the side looked at you carefully.
哼，什么回来就好。这几日她这点给事府上添了多少麻烦？¤Hmph, just come back. How much trouble has she brought to the office these days?
你看到这一幕，心下对于几位长老也有了初步的了解。¤When you see this scene, you have a preliminary understanding of the elders in your heart.
似乎是因为你这个外人在场，长老并没有过多苛责林沐心出逃的事。¤It seems that because you, an outsider, were present, the elders didn't criticize Lin Muxin too much for fleeing.
交头接耳像什么话！哪有点大家之秀的样子！¤What is it like whispering to each other! It doesn't look like everyone's show!
行了苗矮，心儿他们刚刚回来，还是让他们好好休息一番。¤Miao Ay has gone, Xin'er and they just came back, so let them have a good rest.
回来就好，回来就好。¤Just come back, just come back.
你随着林沐心的脚步走入大厅，厅中几位长老分散坐在圆桌边等待着你们。¤You follow Lin Muxin's footsteps into the hall, and several elders in the hall are sitting around the round table waiting for you.
这位前辈，可是来参加下一次的拍卖会么？¤This senior, will you come to the next auction?
咳咳咳...看来还是道友更胜一筹啊。¤Cough cough cough... It seems that fellow Taoists are better.
说罢，她朝你行了个拱手礼，就跳下赛台不见了。¤After saying that, she made an arch salute towards you and jumped off the race stage and disappeared.
你...很强。¤You...very strong.
不错！不愧是我的好徒儿，你当戒骄戒躁，再接再厉。¤Not bad! You are a good pupil of mine. You should stop being arrogant and keep up the good work.
对面修为不弱，输了便是技不如人，别垂头丧气的。¤The opponent's cultivation base is not weak. If you lose, you will be inferior to the human. Don't be discouraged.
我们公孙家最欣赏你这样有潜力的少年英杰，我相信我们还会在云汐城再见的。¤Our Gongsun family admires a young hero with potential like you most. I believe we will see you again in Yunxi City.
你击败了夺魁热门的百里奇，台下观众一片哗然。¤You beat Baili Qi, who everyone thought was going to win and the crowd was in an uproar!
若有哪位道友能让我百里奇战个痛快，或是战胜我，我便愿把这筑基\r丹亲手奉上！我在广陵城百里府随时欢迎切磋，恭候诸位挑战！¤If any of you can give me a good fight or defeat me, I will give you this Foundation Establishment Pill! I am always ready to fight at the Baili Mansion in Guangling City, and await your challenge!
输在{xiongdi}你手上，倒也不算吃亏。¤It's not a disadvantage to lose in {xiongdi} your hands.
锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，你接过升仙台管事恭恭敬敬端上来的筑基丹，伴着阵阵喝彩声，在众人的注目下，离开了会场。¤With gongs and drums blazing and firecrackers blazing, you receive the Foundation Establishment Pill respectfully brought up by the steward of the Ascension Stage and, accompanied by a burst of applause, leave the venue in full view of the crowd.
英杰会挺有趣嘛，不过还是我厉害，嘻嘻。¤The Yingjie meeting is quite interesting, but still I am great, hehehe.
我说{xiongdi}，你下手也太重了点吧！¤I said {xiongdi}, you are too heavy to start!
好不容易打进了决赛...真不甘心...¤Finally made it to the final... I'm not reconciled...
百里奇接过筑基丹，向台下的观众朗声说道。¤Bailiqi took the Foundation Establishment Pill and said aloud to the audience on stage.
别怪兄弟我下手重啊，我要是今年再不拿个英杰会的冠军回去，我那老爹绝饶不了我。¤Don't blame me, brother, I'm so heavy, if I don't get a champion of the Heroes Club and go back this year, my father will never spare me.
徒儿莫要灰心，这才修炼多少年？已经很不错了，好好修炼，准备万全之后，咱们再去百里府试试吧。¤Don't be discouraged, you've only been training for how many years? Let's try again at the Baili Palace after we have prepared everything.
唉，算了算了，反正要不是我爹逼着，我也懒得来参加这英杰会。¤Oh, forget it, anyway, if it wasn't for my dad to force me, I wouldn't bother to come to this hero meeting.
{xiongdi}日后若是路过广陵城，请务必来百里府一叙，到时我再与{xiongdi}讨教！¤If {xiongdi} passes by Guangling City in the future, please come to Bailifu for a report, and then I will talk to {xiongdi} for advice!
恭喜{FirstName}{LastName}选手获得本届英杰会的冠军！¤Congratulations to the {FirstName}{LastName} for becoming the champion of this years Young Hero Tournament!!!
早就听说上一届冠军{FirstName}{LastName}实力不凡，今日的比试，果然没有让我失望。¤I have long heard that the last champion {FirstName}{LastName} was extraordinary. Today's competition did not disappoint me.
{FirstName}{LastName}...有意思，能在英杰会上认识你这样的对手，也算不虚此行了。¤{FirstName}{LastName}...Interesting, it's not worth it to be able to meet opponents like you at the Yingjie meeting.
你这{xiaozi}才修炼没几日，能过打进决赛就已经算不错了。¤You {xiaozi} only practiced for a few days, and it’s considered good if you can make it to the finals.
在下云汐城公孙季，我云汐城与公孙家如今正广纳贤才，若有青年才\r俊，随时可来我云汐城之中寻找机缘。¤I am Gongsun Ji of Yunshi City. My city and the Gongsun family are now looking for talented people, so if you have any young talent, you can come to Yunshi City at any time to look for opportunities.
若得空闲，不如来{color=#d0380a}天星城林府{/color}找我，我们好好聊聊，嘻嘻。¤If you are free, why don't you come {color=#d0380a}to me at the Lin House of the Heavenly Star City{/color} and we will have a good chat, hehehe.
我自幼便学习家族的炼体秘术，一般的炼气修士都不是我三合之敌...¤I have learned the secrets of my family's body refining since I was a child, and ordinary Qi refining cultivators are not the enemy of my triad...
恭喜{FirstName}{LastName}选手再一次获得英杰会的冠军！¤Congratulations to the {FirstName}{LastName} player for winning the Champions League again!
道友以后若是路过{color=#d0380a}天星城{/color}，顺道来{color=#d0380a}林府{/color}与我论道吧。¤If you are passing by {color=#d0380a}Tianxing City{/color} in the future, stop by {color=#d0380a}Lin Mansion{/color} to discuss with me.
不错，是我太坐井观天了，以前只把那些大门派大家族的年轻一辈当做对手，今日与{xiongdi}一战，才知天下之大。\n¤Not bad, I am too sit back and watch the sky, before only those big sects and families of the young generation as opponents, today and {xiongdi} a battle, only to know the world is big. \n
{FirstName}{LastName}道友果然不同凡响，我认输啦。¤{FirstName}{LastName}Daoist friends are really different, I admit defeat.
哎哟哟...疼，疼，疼！¤Ouch... it hurts, it hurts, it hurts!
能打赢我的，你是第一个。¤You are the first to beat me.
这筑基丹，我本无意争夺，我只是想与同阶强者切磋罢了。¤I had no intention of fighting for this Foundation Establishment Pill, I just wanted to spar with a strong person of the same rank.
公孙季一收折扇，抱拳拱手，向你和台下观众们各施了一礼。¤As soon as Gongsun Ji put away his folding fan, he clasped his fist and arched his hand, giving a salute to each of you and the audience on stage.
{xiongdi}过谦了，这擂台之上，赢了就是赢了，何来侥幸一说。\n¤{xiongdi} is too modest. In this arena, if you win, you win. How lucky is it.\n
我道怎有人敢在林府动手，原来是你这老怪。怎么，难不成还想入主林家？¤I wonder how someone dares to make a move in the Lin House, it turns out to be you, the old monster. What, do you still want to enter the Lin family?
小友以后便是林府座上宾客，可以随意出入林府。¤The little friend will be the guest of the Lin Mansion in the future, and can enter and leave the Lin Mansion at will.
找到了，这玉简便是证据，请通羽前辈过目。¤Found it, this jade simple is the evidence, please pass through senior Tong Yu.
不错，你通羽既是出手护住此人，也该给我个说法了。¤Not bad, you Tong Yu is out to protect this person, should also give me a statement.
呵呵，那我也告辞了，等丹阳兄出关再来找他论道。¤Oh, then I also said goodbye, wait for Danyang brother out of the gate and then come back to him to discuss the Dao.
无惑真人一时为之气结，但又拿丹阳子无可奈何，只能选择在夹着尾巴离开时不住地咒骂丹阳子，并期待他此次强行出关导致修为大退。¤The real person who is not confused is furious, but there is nothing he can do about Danyangzi, he can only choose to leave with his tail between his legs cursing Danyangzi and expecting him to force his way out of the gate this time resulting in a great retreat in his cultivation.
哦？你的意思是我的徒儿配不上你林府二小姐，所以才要贿赂？¤Oh? You mean my apprentice is not good enough for your second young lady of the Lin House, that's why you want to bribe?
家主...是我无能，竟在你闭关时出了这样的乱子。¤Family head... It was my incompetence to make such a mess while you were in seclusion.
无妨无妨，那我便告辞了。¤No harm no foul, then I will take my leave.
哼，在林府出手是我徒儿不对，但你林府强行打断结侣典礼一事，我也会如实汇报宫主。她可是一向在意星宫的颜面。¤Hmph, it was my apprentice's fault for striking at the Lin House, but I will also report the truth about your Lin House forcibly interrupting the coupling ceremony to the Palace Master. She has always cared about the face of the Star Palace.
如诸位所见，星宫与林家内部有些纷争，如此丑事就不留大家旁观了，还请各位海涵。¤As you can see, there is some internal strife between the Star Palace and the Lin family, so please bear with me if I don't leave you on the sidelines for such a scandal.
不必谦虚，此次也是多亏{FirstName}小友助力。不但搜集了栖云与冲虚勾结的证据，还引冲虚出手，让我于闭关中发现了他们师徒的恶计。¤There is no need to be modest, this time is also thanks to {FirstName} little friend help. The first thing you need to do is to get the evidence of the collusion between Qiyun and Chongxu, and also draw Chongxu's hand, so that I discovered their master and disciple's evil plan in seclusion.
无惑大长老，贵徒为了与林沐心结成道侣，贿赂我府三长老。如今证据在此，我林府自然要先彻查三长老，让家主发落。这大典也就不得不...¤Grand Elder Confusion, your disciple bribed the third elder of my house in order to form a Daoist couple with Lin MuXin. Now that the evidence is here, my Lin House naturally has to investigate the Third Elder thoroughly first, so that the family head can be sentenced. This grand ceremony will also have to...
就你这点实力，不过米粒之光，战胜你有何难？若不是在林家大殿之内，场地太小了些，我只会赢得更快。¤This strength of yours is just a grain of light, how difficult is it to defeat you? If it wasn't within the Lin family hall, the venue is a little too small, I would only win faster.
好了好了，为父不拿你姐妹俩说笑。¤Okay, okay, my father does not make fun of your sisters.
你再重复一遍之前的话语后，他才反应过来。¤After you repeat the previous words again, he reacted.
待那两人出了林府后，通羽上人才望向丹阳子和你。¤Only after those two people had left the Lin House, did Lord Tong Yu look at Danyangzi and you.
而你则是一脸淡然地看着对方，气息虽也是有些杂乱，但除此之外并无大碍。¤And you are looking at each other with a bemused face, although the breath is also a bit disorganized, but otherwise there is no big problem.
倒是栖云，嗯，不提也罢。¤The actual fact is that the actual person is not a person, but a person.
通羽上人却还没从冲虚散人被你击败的冲击中恢复，久久未作言语。¤The top of the Tong Yu, however, has not yet recovered from the shock of Chong Xu Sanren being defeated by you, and did not make a speech for a long time.
通羽前辈，幸不辱命，晚辈找到证据了。¤Tong Yu seniors, fortunately, the late generation found the evidence.
通羽上人领命离开。¤The top of the Tong Yu led the order to leave.
住手！先听他把话说完再动手也不迟。¤Stop! It's not too late to hear him out before you make your move.
心儿？她在哪？¤Xin'er? Where is she?
不用担心，我们还是先处理当下的事吧。¤Don't worry, let's deal with the matter at hand first.
若不是我倡导结侣自由，都想让雪儿和心儿与你结缘，籍此拉拢了，哈哈哈。¤If I hadn't advocated the freedom of coupling, I would have wanted Xue'er and Xin'er to tie the knot with you and pull it together by virtue of this, hahaha.
就是配不上！我丹阳子的女儿岂是你贾良行那废物徒弟想娶就能娶的！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Just not worthy! My Danyangzi's daughter can't be married just because you want to marry that punk disciple of Jia Liang Xing! {vpunch=10,0.5}
前辈谬赞了，只是他冲虚实力不济，晚辈没感到压力而已。¤The senior fallacious praise, just he Chongxu strength is not good, the late generation did not feel the pressure.
好，好，很好，小友果然没有辜负心儿的信任，而且还远远超出了我们的期望，好，很好。¤I'm sure you've lived up to Xin's trust, but you've also far exceeded our expectations, good, good.
一时间除冲虚满溢着不甘的话语外，林府大殿竟是满座皆寂，可谓是了无声息，哪里还像是之前那个结侣典礼现场。¤In addition to Chong Xu's overflowing words of resignation, the hall of the Lin House is full of silence, it can be said to be silent, where it is still like the previous couple ceremony site.
这结丹所用的聚顶丹与一件我个人收藏的上品法器防具便是相赠于你，希望能为小友助力些许。除此之外，小友以后便是林府座上宾客，可以随意出入林府。¤The top of the pills and a personal collection of top-quality magic weapon defense is a gift to you, I hope to help you a little. In addition, you will be a guest of the Lin House and can come and go as you please.
{FirstName}小友，这次确是多亏了你，不但搜集了栖云与冲虚勾结的证据，还引冲虚出手，让我于闭关中发现了他们师徒的恶计。¤{FirstName}This time, thanks to you, not only did you gather evidence of collusion between Qiyun and Chongxu, but you also drew Chongxu's hand, so that I discovered their master and disciple's evil plan in seclusion.
二小姐她....¤Second Miss she ....
冲虚本意是身负重伤，强撑着而已，被你一激更是行气不畅而口吐鲜血，身上的伤只怕是又重了几分。¤The original intention is to be seriously wounded, strong to hold on, by you a provocation is not smooth and spit blood, the body of the injury is only a few points heavier.
无需自责，你已经做的不错了，和星宫其他分支联姻也本是惯例，苗矮也无罪责，只是被无惑这老匹夫的徒弟钻了空子而已。¤No need to blame yourself, you have done a good job, and the other branches of the Star Palace marriage is also the practice, Miao short also not guilty, just by the Patriarch's disciple exploited the loopholes.
这可是林家大殿，还由不得你胡来！¤This is the great hall of the Lin family, you are not allowed to do whatever you want!
请便，若是没有其他事，现在就可以去。至于你那废物徒儿想强娶我宝贝女儿一事，晚点再跟你算账！¤If you have nothing else to do, you can go now. As for your wasteful apprentice's attempt to forcibly marry my precious daughter, I'll settle the score with you later!
通羽不敢，但...¤Tong Yu dare not, but ...
小友不必客气。那我便先去处理家事了，让雪儿陪你逛逛林府吧。¤You don't have to be polite. Then I will go to take care of family matters, let Xue'er accompany you to stroll around the Lin House.
说法？是该给个说法，不过是你给我！¤The law? It is time to give a statement, but you give me!
{FirstName}小友好胆识，竟敢以{$Var}面对金丹期强者。¤{FirstName}Little friendly guts, how dare you face a Jindan stage powerhouse with {$Var}.
{FirstName}小友可是找到我要的东西了？¤{I'm not sure if I've found what I'm looking for.
面对在座各位前辈投来的不同目光，你只是面带笑容淡然说出四字，然后便走向通羽上人。¤Faced with the different gazes cast by the seniors here, you just blandly uttered four words with a smile on your face, and then walked towards Tong Yu Shangren.
小友不必客气。¤Little friend need not be polite.
此人坏我大典，我怎能容他！¤This person is bad for me, how can I tolerate him!
林沐雪半是嗔怪半是娇羞地看着丹阳子，后者也只是哈哈一笑，转而谈及其他话题而已。¤Lin Mu Xue looked at Danyangzi half in anger and half in shyness, and the latter just laughed and turned to other topics only.
好，很好，小友果然没有辜负心儿的信任。¤Good, very good, you really did not disappoint Xin'er's trust.
通羽上人没有理会冲虚散人，而是转向宾客。¤Tong Yu Shangren ignored Chong Xu Sanren, but turned to the guests.
通羽，这是我徒儿的结侣典礼，你将宾客遣散是何用意？¤Tong Yu, this is my apprentice's coupling ceremony, what is your intention of dispatching the guests?
哈哈哈，无惑的徒弟在我眼里虽是废物，但他毕竟是金丹期。只能说小友的实力已是卓绝筑基，势凌金丹。¤Hahaha, no confusion of the disciple in my eyes is a waste, but he is after all the Jindan stage. I can only say that the strength of the young friend is already outstanding Foundation, potential Ling Jindan.
冲虚满脸惊骇地看着你，但在座不乏金丹甚至元婴修士，又有谁能预见到你竟能轻易击败金丹后期的冲虚散人。¤Chong Xu looked at you with a shocked face, but there is no shortage of Jindan and even Yuan Ying Vagrant Cultivators here, and who could have foreseen that you could easily defeat the late Jindan Chong Xu San Ren.
你也不再理会他，在满座宾客的注视下走向通羽上人¤You also no longer care about him, in the seat full of guests watching towards the Lord Tong Yu
无妨，我已传音给心儿叫她回来。你和苗矮先把栖云押入密室，晚点我再过去。¤No matter, I have sent a message to Xin'er and asked her to come back. You and Miao Shorty first escort Quyun into the secret room, I will go there later.
冲虚，住手。¤Stop it, Okinawa.
咳...咳咳，你究竟是何方神圣，竟...竟然...不！我不信！¤Cough... Who the hell are you? How dare you... No! I don't believe you!
你！你什么意思！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤You! What do you mean? {vpunch=10,0.5}
通羽上人正欲上前劝阻冲虚散人，却发现他已是跌坐于地，衣袍破裂，身负血痕，乃至体内的灵气也是紊乱不息。¤The top of Tong Yu was about to go forward to dissuade Chong Xu Sanren, but found that he had fallen to the ground, his robe was torn, his body was bloodstained, and even the aura in his body was disordered.
见过前辈。晚辈终究还是实力不济，让前辈见笑了。¤Well met seniors. The current generation is still not up to par, laugh if you will.
哼，算你走运。¤Well, you're lucky.
通羽，这是我徒儿的结侣典礼，你找人打伤我徒儿又将宾客遣散是何用意？¤The first thing you need to do is to find someone to hurt my apprentice and disperse the guests.
冲虚散人早已是怒不可遏，驱动神通便是全力向你攻来。¤Chongxu Sanren has long been furious, and driving the supernatural power is to attack you with all his strength.
若是真的，那此事可不像冲虚道友说的那般有风度。¤If it is true, then this matter is not as graceful as what fellow Daoist Chongxu said.
难道当年坏我机缘的是你？！¤Could it be you who ruined my chances back then? !
要知道，修士突破瓶颈虽然困难万分，但突破成功之后对于修士本身的精、气、神都是有莫大的提升。¤You must know that although it is extremely difficult for a cultivator to break through the bottleneck, the success of the breakthrough will greatly improve the cultivator's essence, energy, and spirit.
守门弟子带你到星宫大殿前便是推说还有其他要事在身，急忙退下。¤The gate-keeper disciple took you to the front of the Xinggong main hall because he said that there were other important things at hand, and hurriedly retired.
不过是闲云野鹤一散修，叫我厉道友就好。¤Just a wandering independent cultivator, call me Cultivator Li.
恭喜冲虚道友晋阶元婴期，星宫又是多了一位元婴修士啊，可喜可贺。¤Congratulations to fellow Daoist Chongxu for advancing to the Nascent Soul Stage, there is another Nascent Soul cultivator in Xinggong, which is gratifying.
王登带你到星宫大殿前便是推说还有其他要事在身，急忙退下。¤When Wang Deng took you to the Xinggong Hall, he said that he had other important matters and hurriedly retired.
嘿嘿，冲虚道友不愿承认自己是废物，我可以理解。毕竟要不是参与了多年前的林府事件，我也想不到冲虚道友作为星宫长老竟能如此无耻。¤Hehe, fellow Daoist Chongxu is reluctant to admit that he is a waste, I can understand. After all, if I hadn't been involved in the Lin Mansion incident many years ago, I would never have imagined that fellow Daoist Chongxu would be so shameless as an elder of the Star Palace.
不敢，我不过是平平无奇一散修罢了。倒是冲虚道友真是令人景仰，竟能在寿元将尽前突破。若是换做其他修士只怕已是心境难稳，难过心魔这一关。¤No, I'm just a mediocre independent cultivator. On the contrary, Cultivator Chongxu is really admirable, and he was able to break through before the end of his life. If it were any other cultivators, I am afraid that their mind will be so unstable that they lose themselves to their inner-demons.
不敢不敢，是师尊教导得好，我作为弟子不过是恪守师尊的教导而已。¤I don't dare, it's because the teacher taught me well, and as a disciple, I just abide by the teacher's teaching.
走入大殿时，冲虚散人果然已是在殿中等候。相比多年前垂垂老矣一看就是寿元无多的样貌，现在的冲虚散人看起来是年轻许多，只是有些异样的苍白。你估摸这便是用所谓的邪术突破留下的后遗症。¤When entering the hall, Chongxu Sanren was already waiting in the hall. Compared with the old man years ago, he looked like he had little Shouyuan, but now the Chongxu Sanren looks much younger, but a little strangely pale. You guessed that this is the after-effect left by the so-called magic breakthrough.
听说道友曾想与林家二小姐结为道侣，并利用星宫秘术与她双修以突破瓶颈，最后未尝所愿。可有此事？¤I heard that the Taoist friend once wanted to become a Taoist partner with the second lady of the Lin family, and used the secret technique of the star palace to double cultivation with her to break through the bottleneck, but in the end nothing happened. Can there be such a thing?
冲虚散人狂笑着，同时一道强劲的神识扫过你的位置，却被林家秘宝轻易屏蔽了去，让其探查完全失效。¤Chongxu Sanren laughed wildly, and at the same time a strong sense of consciousness swept across your position, but was easily blocked by the Lin Family Secret Treasure, making its exploration completely ineffective.
等等...我竟然无法察探知到你的境界...难道突破元婴比我更早！？{vpunch=10,0.5}不，不，这不可能！¤Wait...I can't even detect your realm...Could it be that I broke through Nascent Soul earlier than me! ? {vpunch=10,0.5}No, no, it can't be!
那冲虚散人原本苍白的脸“刷”的一下便是涌上潮红，显然是你给他留下的印象不浅。¤The original pale face of the Chongxu Sanren swiped and flushed, obviously because you left him with a deep impression.
好啊好啊，当年有丹阳子护着，我没能拿你怎样。如今竟还敢送上门来，那你的小命我就笑纳了，哼哈哈哈！¤Alright, alright, when Dan Yangzi was there to protect me, I couldn't do anything with you. Now that you still dare to deliver it to your door, then I will laugh at your little life, hahahaha!
原来是厉道友，久仰久仰。¤It turned out to be fellow Daoist Li, whom he has admired for a long time.
你在观察冲虚散人时，对方也是注意到站在大殿门口的你。¤When you were observing the Chongxu scattered people, the other party also noticed you standing at the door of the main hall.
当你提到这个话题时，冲虚原本苍白的脸色更是变得发青，一丝狠色闪过，但仅是瞬息便已消失不见。¤When you mentioned this topic, Chong Xu's originally pale complexion became even more blue, and a trace of ruthlessness flashed, but it disappeared in just a moment.
哼，我看道友是修炼走火入魔乃至神智不清了，竟来我星宫胡言乱语。来人，送...¤Hmph, I see that fellow Daoist has gone crazy in his practice and even lost his mind, so he came to my star palace to talk nonsense. come, send...
哈哈哈，冲虚道友果然是正道典范，此等风度，令我深感钦佩。¤Hahaha, fellow Daoist Chongxu is indeed a model of righteousness. I am deeply admired by such demeanor.
抱歉抱歉，我有些口无遮拦，还请冲虚道友不要介怀。¤I'm sorry, I'm a bit blunt, please don't mind your fellow Daoist Chongxu.
呵，境界有什么意义，就你这没用的废物，当年我就能击败你，现在更不用说！¤Oh, what is the meaning of realm, just you useless waste, I was able to defeat you back then, let alone now!
走入大殿时，冲虚散人果然已是在殿中等候。相比多年前垂垂老矣一看就是寿元无多的样貌，现在的冲虚散人看起来是年轻许多，只是有些异常的苍白。你估摸这便是用所谓的邪术突破留下的后遗症。¤When entering the hall, Chongxu Sanren was already waiting in the hall. Compared with the old man years ago, he looked like he had little Shouyuan, but now the Chongxu Sanren looks much younger, but a little abnormally pale. You guessed that this is the after-effect left by the so-called magic breakthrough.
冲虚道友果然与众不同，竟能把那种无耻的行为称之为机缘，让人眼界大开啊哈哈哈。¤Daoist Chongxu is really different, and he can call that shameless behavior an opportunity, which is eye-opening hahaha.
哪怕是在突破过程中不太顺利，经脉和神识有所受损，突破成功后也不会像冲虚散人一般面透体虚，像是潜力被榨干。¤Even if the breakthrough process is not smooth, and the meridians and spiritual consciousness are damaged, after the breakthrough is successful, it will not be like a person who is emptied, as if the potential has been drained.
却有此事，但星宫素来反感为了双修而结成道侣，我作为星宫长老自然要做出表率，不能勉强对方。¤There is such a thing, but Xinggong has always been disgusted to form a Taoist partner for the sake of double cultivation. As an elder of Xinggong, I naturally have to set an example and cannot force the other side.
道友只不过是说了实情，我当然不会介意。¤Fellow Daoist is just telling the truth, of course I don't mind.
哼，厉道友知道的不少嘛。但你说是来祝贺，却一再出言辱我，是何用意？¤Hmph, Daoyou Li knows a lot. But you said you were here to congratulate, but you kept insulting me. What was your intention?
这...道友说的倒也不无道理，若不是门派提供的功法与资源，我也的确是难以走到如今这...¤This... What the Taoist said is not unreasonable. If it weren't for the exercises and resources provided by the sect, it would be difficult for me to get to where I am now...
同喜同喜。不知道友师承何派？怎么称呼？¤Happy with joy. Don't know what kind of friends and teachers are inherited? What is it called?
哈哈哈，冲虚道友可不是侥幸。早就听说星宫秘术天下无双，道友又是星宫大长老弟子，想必是突破之时受益匪浅吧。¤Hahaha, fellow Daoist Chongxu is not a fluke. It has long been heard that the Secret Art of the Star Palace is unparalleled in the world, and the Taoist friend is also the disciple of the Great Elder of the Star Palace. It must have benefited a lot from the breakthrough.
{size=34}呵，真是废物。{/size}¤{size=34}Oh, what a waste. {/size}
这倒是提醒了我，冲虚道友完成化婴可能还真没依赖星宫。¤This reminds me that fellow Daoist Chongxu may not really rely on the star palace to complete the baby transformation.
只是我听说，与林府的联姻之所以未成，是因为某人贿赂林府栖云长老一事败露，后由林家家主出面这才让联姻终止，也不知是真是假。¤It's just that I heard that the marriage with the Lin Mansion failed because it was revealed that someone bribed the elder Qiyun of the Lin Mansion, and then the head of the Lin family came forward to terminate the marriage. I don't know if it was true or not.
不过是侥幸而已。宁州修仙之人不下千百，我冲虚也只是其中普通的一员，若不是运气较好，又怎有幸走到成功化婴的这一天呢。¤It was just a fluke. There are no less than 1000 people who cultivate immortals in Ning Province, and I am just an ordinary member of Chongxu. If it is not for good luck, how can I be fortunate to reach this day of successful infant transformation.
哈哈哈，冲虚道友误会了，我无意出言侮辱，只是真心觉得道友用尽手段修成元婴，结果实力还如此不济...¤Hahaha, fellow Daoist Chongxu misunderstood, I have no intention of insulting, but I really feel that fellow Daoist has exhausted all means to cultivate into Nascent Soul, but the result is still so weak...
{vpunch=10,0.5}短短几十年，你！怎么可能！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Just a few decades, you! how is this possible!
你嘴上虽还在调侃着冲虚散人，手上也是驱动神通与他战至一处。¤Although you are still joking about rushing towards the vacuous person, you are also driving the magical power to fight with him.
冲虚散人被你打断话语也是一愣，旋即恢复神态。除脸上挂着的微笑有些显假以外，倒也没太多表情变化。¤Chongxu Sanren was stunned for a moment when you interrupted his words, and then he regained his demeanor. Apart from the fake smile on his face, there was not much change in his expression.
{vpunch=10,0.5}别想唬我！受死吧！！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Don't try to fool me! Die! !
我道是谁会来祝贺，没成想是你这小王八蛋。¤I thought who would come to congratulate, I didn't think it was you little bastard.
我道是谁来拜访，没想到竟是你这小王八蛋。好啊好啊，我刚突破便是送来一份大礼，哼哈哈哈！¤I knew who came to visit, but I didn't expect it to be you little bastard. Alright, alright, I just got a big gift when I broke through, hahaha!
等突破到化神，要渡劫的那天，就吃掉主人留给我的那颗化劫丹，到上面去找他。¤When you break through to Deity Transformation, to cross the day of the tribulation, eat the master left me that the transformation of the pills, to go up there to find him.
渡劫本就是逆天而行，任何阴差阳错都可能导致失败。¤Transitioning is supposed to be against the heavens, and any missteps can lead to failure.
何人擅闯我主人洞府？¤Who is trespassing in my master's cave?
我帮你打开这大阵，你便出去找你的主人吧，他现在正需要你的帮助。¤I'll help you open this formation, so you can go out and find your master, he needs your help right now.
你便是鹤真人所说的那只白狐吧，鹤真人他……¤You are the white fox that the crane reality said, right? The crane reality he ......
只见那白狐身上的毛瞬间绷直，露出尖牙，下一秒便向你扑了过来。¤I saw that the white fox body hair instantly tensed up, revealing sharp teeth, the next second will pounce on you.
这洞府本来是主人留下来保护我用的。¤This cave was originally left by the master to protect me with.
只要拿着主人的系命玉佩，不管多远都能找到主人，可是现在……¤As long as you take the master's tethered life jade pendant, no matter how far away you can find the master, but now ......
它抖了抖身子，跑到了出口面前，又回头看了你一眼。¤It shivered, ran to the exit and looked back at you again.
你若相信你主人，只要他未身死道消，便迟早会有东山再起的一天。¤If you believe in your master, as long as he has not died, there will sooner or later be a day to rise again.
“我能做的便只有这些了。先看看鹤真人都留下了些什么东西吧。”¤That's all I can do. First of all, let's see what the real crane has left behind.
何人擅闯我主人洞府？我主人给我的系命玉佩为何突然碎了？¤Who is trespassing in my master's cave? Why did the jade pendant my master gave me to tie my life suddenly shatter?
眼见你不像是在说谎的样子，白狐耷拉下脑袋，瘫软在了地上，时不时还会传来低沉的“呜——”的声音。¤Seeing that you don't look like you're lying, the white fox drops its head and goes limp on the ground, with a low 'oo-' sound coming from time to time.
你将事情经过一五一十地告诉了它。它先是惊慌失措了一阵，随后悲恸到好似流下了泪水，最后却又升起了滔天怒火。¤You told it exactly what had happened. It first panicked for a while, then mourned to the point of shedding tears, and finally rose up with a great deal of anger.
去死。¤Go to hell.
你刚进入鹤真人的洞府，便看见他所说的那只白狐，正极为警惕地盯着你。¤When you first entered the cave of the crane, you saw the white fox he mentioned, staring at you with great vigilance.
说完，它便头也不回地跑出去了。¤After saying that, it ran out without looking back.
你主人便是那个自称鹤真人的家伙？¤Your master is the guy who calls himself the Crane?
“原来那道光是与这玉佩联系的一道神魂…”¤So the light was a divine soul linked to this jade pendant...
言罢，你便将阵法打开了一个口子。¤After the words, you opened an opening in the formation.
“主人需要我…”¤Master needs me...
他说，以我这点修为，要是在外面乱晃，一定很危险，就让我专心呆在这里修炼，¤He said, with this cultivation, if I wander outside, it must be very dangerous, let me focus on staying here to cultivate.
姑娘，现在伤感也是无用，倒不如想想如何帮主人渡过此劫难。¤Girl, it is useless to feel sad now, rather think about how to help the master through this calamity.
听到这里，白狐顿时站起身来，眼睛里又重新泛起了光。¤Hearing this, the white fox stood up at once, and his eyes were flooded with light again.
骗子，就连吞云大圣都不是主人的对手，渡劫怎么可能会失败？¤Liar, even the Cloud Swallowing Sage is not a match for the master, how could he fail in the tribulation?
如今他滥杀无辜，已经被我诛杀了…你最好忘了他。¤Now that he has been killed by me...you'd better forget about him.
你谨慎的在此地址值守，前方一名门内弟子向你走来，你们互相点头示意。¤You are on duty at this address carefully, and a disciple in front of you walks towards you, and you nod to each other.
你谨慎的在此地址值守，似乎有一道隐晦的气息在旁潜伏。¤You are guarding this address carefully, there seems to be a faint breath lurking nearby.
你谨慎的在此地值守，前方一道黑影向你扑来。\n¤You are guarding here cautiously, and a dark shadow in front of you rushes towards you.\n
杀了他...救出我的师傅和我玄古门的师兄弟们。¤Kill him... Save my master and my brothers and sisters of the Profound Ancient Sect.
你若是不允，我就只能希望他得偿所愿之后能信守诺言了。¤If you don't, I can only hope that he will keep his word when he gets what he wants.
精炼麒麟血啊，从豹麟兽精血中获得麒麟血，但那护法在此法上推陈出新进一步精炼可让品阶再上一层。¤Refining the blood of the Qilin, ah, from the essence of the leopard-lin beast to obtain the blood of the qilin, but that Guardian have pushed on this method further, and is capable of refining the grade to a higher level..
现在这时候还关心麒麟血？¤Care about unicorn blood at this point in time?
咳，误信了小人啊。¤Ahem, misplaced faith in a villain.
{LastName}又是我在这里等你帮我，呵呵，安心最后一次麻烦你了。¤{LastName}Again, I'm here waiting for you to help me. Oh, peace of mind for the last time to bother you.
你在做什么？¤What are you doing?
你若是答应，我全部身家双手奉上，并用麒麟血为你铭刻灵纹。¤If you agree, I will give you my entire fortune with both hands and inscribe you with spirit patterns in Qilin blood.
不做不行啊，我深种魔神蛊，现在已经受他所制，不得不继续啊。¤I can't do it, I'm deeply planted with the Demon God compulsion and now I'm under his control, so I have to continue.
咳咳，{LastName}你终于来了。¤Ahem, {LastName} you're finally here.
魔神蛊？？！！你被古神教暗算了？¤The Devil God Compulsion? You've been assassinated by the Ancient God Cult?
我怎么帮你？¤How can I help you?
有很多问题吧？我们长话短说。¤There are a lot of questions, right? Let's keep it short.
我们都曾以为那位大护法是我玄古门中兴之人，但是看错了。¤We had all thought that Grand Guardian was from my Profound Ancient Sect, but we were wrong.
盯眼看去台上坐着一个玄古门修士，正在此地维持着阵法的运转，但要看去正是你寻找的友人。¤Staring up at the stage sits a Profound Ancient Clan cultivator who is maintaining the formation here, but to look at it is the very friend you are looking for.
你们玄古门的人呢？¤Where are your people from the Profound Ancient Sect?
他承诺我帮他搞定这精血他就放了我师傅。¤He promised that he would let my master go if I helped him with this essence blood.
萧儿的天赋心性实属上佳，我派这数百年间也找不到能比得上他的。¤Xiao'er's talent and disposition are really good, and I haven't been able to match him for hundreds of years.
修炼一途乃是逆天而为，若是心性不够坚定，便是天资再好，也不会有什么作为的。¤The path of cultivation is going against the sky. If the xinxing is not firm enough, no matter how talented you are, you can do nothing.
传统功夫以点到为止。¤Traditional Kung Fu ends with a point.
被困之时，从他们的只言片语中倒是听到了些消息。¤When trapped, from their only words did hear some news.
多谢道友提醒。¤Thank you for reminding us.
几道魂体从阵中逃逸而出。见状，你向着其中一个魂体飞了过去。¤Several souls escape from the formation. Seeing this, you fly over to one of the souls.
刚刚他们说还有两座阵法，你不如多去附近的小岛上看看，可能会有意外的收获。¤Just now they said there are two more formations, why don't you go to the nearby islands more often, there may be unexpected gains.
无妨。道友暂时还是远离此地为好，莫又被他们抓了去。¤No matter. You should stay away from here for the time being, don't get caught by them again.
将我等抓去，是想给大长老炼制{color=#d0380a}万魂幡{/color}。¤The reason for capturing us is to refine the {color=#d0380a} Ten Thousand Souls Streamer{/color} for the Grand Elder.
被赶出来？魂体之间难道不是互惠互利的关系？¤Driven out? Isn't there a mutually beneficial relationship between soul bodies?
我不知道那些外围的灵魂体在打什么算盘，反正老夫是受不了这个气。¤I do not know what those peripheral soul bodies are playing, anyway, the old man can not stand this anger.
你站在原地，待灵魂体们都飞远后，方才开口。¤You stand in place and wait for the souls to fly away before you speak.
只有上缴过神阴石的魂体才有资格在阴气旋旁修炼，可若不能修炼，呆在那岛上又有何用？¤Only souls who have surrendered the Divine Yin Stone are qualified to cultivate next to the Yin Qi Spiral, but if you can't cultivate, what's the use of staying on that island?
原来如此…那你们在被困期间，可有何发现？¤I see...so what did you find out while you were trapped?
可岛上魂体众多，难道每一位都给岛主上缴了神阴石？¤But there are many soul bodies on the island, did every one of them surrender their divine Yin stones to the island master?
老头，你没事吧？¤Old man, are you all right?
事实上，任何魂体若不能给岛主带去神阴石，久而久之都只会被排挤在外。¤As a matter of fact, any soul that can't bring a divine Yin stone to the island master will only be sidelined over time.
这个我等也没见过。便不清楚了。¤This we have not seen. Then it is not clear.
并不是。¤Not really.
说来惭愧。道友对我等有救命之恩，我等却只能为道友提供些消息…¤I am ashamed to say. You have saved our lives, but we can only provide you with some information...
此前我对这玄冥海也是一无所知...若非如此，我等断不会来此。¤Previously, I know nothing about this Xuan Heihai... If it were not for that, we would not have come here.
这万魂幡又是何物？¤And what is this Ten Thousand Souls Streamer?
“此阵竟也藏有神阴石…先收下吧。”¤This formation has hidden a divine Yin stone...take it first.
多谢道友搭救，只是我等都是因未能上缴神阴石被赶出阴魂岛，所以不得不出来另寻修炼之所的。¤Thank you for your rescue, but we were driven out of the Yin Soul Island for failing to pay the divine Yin stone, so we had to come out to find another place to cultivate.
这只是岛主对外人的说辞罢了。¤This is just the island master's words for outsiders.
随着你最后的致命一击，两名邪修应声倒地，拘魂阵也消散于无形。¤With your last fatal blow, the two evil cultivators fell to the ground and the soul-holding formation dissipated into nothingness.
他们自称{color=#d0380a}万魂殿{/color}修士，同样的阵法，玄冥海中应该还有{color=#d0380a}两{/color}座。¤They call themselves {color=#d0380a}Many Souls Hall{/color} cultivators, the same formation, there should be {color=#d0380a} two more {/color} seats in the Xuanxian Sea.
我没事…只是这阵法当真诡异，我仅透出这么点气息竟然都被发现了，还真是小觑不得。¤I'm fine...but this formation is really weird, I only let out so little breath was found, really can not be underestimated.
我正在调查玄冥海的这些邪修，道友对于这片海域可有什么情报可以分享？¤I'm investigating these evil cultivators in the Xuanxu Sea, do you have any information to share about this sea?
你这魔神蛊已经发作了，先稳定伤势我们再做其他。¤This Demon God compulsion of yours has already taken hold, let's stabilize the injury first before we do anything else.
唉，先出去吧。¤Alas, go out first.
说完，魔神蛊的反噬爆发，轩岚诺已经失去了气息。¤Having said that, the devil god compulsion's backlash erupted and Xuan Lanuo had lost his breath.
来吧，看这是我们数十年的努力，看看我们最后的作品是什么样。¤Come and see what this is all about, after decades of hard work, and see what our final product looks like.
阁主不在，就由老夫会会你。¤If the pavilion master is not there, the old man will meet you.
嗯？还有？？¤Huh? There's more??
好险…¤So close...
唉…还是先看看这里有什么东西吧。¤I'd better see what's here first.
{vpunch=10,0.5}言罢，白狐体内传出一股巨大的能量，随即爆炸开来。¤{vpunch=10,0.5}With those words, a huge energy came from the white fox's body, which then exploded.
收手吧，你并不是我的对手。¤Stop it, you are not my opponent.
你…我跟你拼了。¤You...I'll fight with you.
这白狐倒是忠心，只可惜…¤This white fox is loyal, but unfortunately...
那白狐拖着遍体鳞伤的身躯，依然没有停下的意思。¤The white fox, dragging its battered body, still didn't stop.
然而一看到你出现，那些弟子立马作鸟兽散，一时间半个人影都寻不见了。¤However, as soon as I saw you appear, those disciples immediately became birds and beasts, and for a while, half of them were gone.
不过几息时间，一道散发着阴邪气息的身影出现在你的视野中，想来便是禾山道的大首领了。¤In just a few breaths, a figure exuding a yin and evil aura appeared in your field of vision. I think it is the great leader of Heshan Dao.
就是你这黄毛{xiaozi}在此地撒野？有趣，有趣，本座甚久未见如此不知天高地厚之人了！¤It's you, the yellow-haired {xiaozi} who is here to go wild? Interesting, interesting, I haven't seen such a person in this seat for a long time!
大胆小儿！我倒要看看你有没有这个本事！¤Bold child! I want to see if you have this ability!
你禾山道在宁州作威作福，欺害无辜，如今是该付出代价了！¤You Heshandao dominated in Ning Province and deceived the innocent. Now it is time to pay the price!
你一踏入幽谷，便见到一排禾山道弟子聚集在入口处，像是要阻拦什么一样齐齐展开灵力屏障，景象煞是壮观。¤As soon as you step into the valley, you will see a row of Heshan Dao disciples gathered at the entrance, spreading out the spiritual barriers as if to block something. The scene is truly spectacular.
据说雷鸣海终日被雷云笼罩，稍有不慎便会遭到雷击，是无尽之海中最危险的海域之一。¤It is said that the thundering sea is Shielded by thunderclouds all day long, and if you are not careful, you will be struck by lightning. It is one of the most dangerous sea areas in the endless sea.
突然此地的禁制激活了。¤Suddenly the ban on this place is activated.
唉，我们就点人手，偌大个沃焦山，再加之咱们行事又要避开离火门的人。这都多久了，再拖下去离火门的人也是不吃素的啊。¤We have only a handful of people, a huge Mount Inferno, and we have to avoid the people of the Heavenly Fire Gate. It's been a long time now, and if we keep dragging it out, the people of the Heavenly Fire Gate are not immune.
（取出传音符）嗯？哼哼，畜生就是畜生。¤(Takes out voice transmission charm) Hmm? Hmph, a brute is a brute.
不过，你说的有道理多日探查尚无结果，这么下....¤However, you have a point about multiple days of probing being inconclusive yet, so down ....
总坛也真是的，连只畜生都看不住。¤The head altar is really something, it can't even keep an eye on a beast.
嗯。我们撤。¤Hmm. We're pulling out.
好了好了，明白了。¤Okay, okay, got it.
来者对于沃焦山甚是熟悉，一边避开了驻守弟子，一边熟练的穿梭于山林之间。跟着两人出了沃焦山，窜入山脚的一个洞窟。¤The visitors were familiar with Mount Wogiao, and avoided the stationed disciples as they skilfully navigated between the mountains and forests. They followed the two out of the Wogiao Mountain and scurried into a cave at the foot of the mountain.
你动静小一点，别惊动了其他人。¤Keep your movements down so you don't disturb the others.
好了，先把事情办好吧，最近护法心情不好若是办事不利有咱俩好受的。¤Well, let's get it done first. The Guardians has been in a bad mood lately and if we don't get things done, we'll both suffer.
道友，此地风水不错是个长眠的好地方。¤Fellow Daoist, this is a good feng shui place for a long sleep.
怎么，到手了？¤What, it's here?
言罢，他们便头也不回的离开了。¤After the words, they left without looking back.
前辈愿除此妖，实乃我等之幸。¤We are fortunate that our predecessors are willing to get rid of this demon.
既然这幽厄如此危险，你为何还要来此寻找神阴石？¤The actual fact is that you can find a lot of people who are looking for the God's Yin Stone.
无妨，本座再自行寻找一番罢。¤No matter, I'll find out for myself.
本座前来剿灭幽厄，你可知它现在何方？¤I have come to exterminate the Phantom, do you know where it is now?
此獠神出鬼没，除非是亲眼见它吞噬魂体，否则你几乎不可能发现它。¤This fang is so ghostly that unless you see it devouring souls with your own eyes, it's almost impossible for you to find it.
不远处一些魂体匆匆飞过。你飞上前去，打算问出点关于幽厄的消息。¤Not far away some souls fly by hurriedly. You fly up to them, intending to ask some news about the phoenix.
等等，你当真要对付幽厄？¤Wait a minute, you really want to deal with the Yu Er?
高空中，一个相当凝实的魂体快速飞过。你飞上前去，打算问出点关于幽厄的消息。¤High in the sky, a rather solid soul body flew by quickly. You flew up, intending to ask some news about You Er.
他神情略微复杂的看着你。¤He looks at you with a slightly complicated expression.
不敢，前辈愿为我等除害，应该是在下谢过前辈才是。¤I don't dare, I should be the one to thank you for your willingness to help us get rid of the evil.
我在如此高空飞行，本就是为了躲避此妖，又怎会见过？¤I am flying at such a high altitude, which is supposed to avoid this demon, so how can I see it again?
在下在如此高空飞行，本就是为了躲避此妖，自然是没有见过。¤I was flying at such a high altitude, originally to avoid this demon, so naturally I had not seen it before.
原来如此，那便谢过道友了。¤So that's how it is, then thank you, fellow Daoist.
若我们见过幽厄，便见不到你了。¤If we had seen Yu Er, we would not have seen you.
原来如此，多谢道友。¤So that's how it is, thank you very much, fellow Daoist.
高空中，一个相当凝实的魂体快速飞过。你飞上前去，询问关于幽厄的消息。¤High in the sky, a rather solid soul flies by quickly. You fly up and ask for news about the Phantom.
他们原本阴沉着脸，在感应到你化神的威压之后，变得恭敬起来。¤They were originally gloomy, but became respectful after sensing the mighty pressure of your Deity transformation.
既然他们没有遇到，说明不在这附近，再换个地方问问吧。¤Since they did not encounter, it means that it is not near here, so ask another place.
我一直在这岛上寻找神阴石，自然是没见过。¤I have been looking for the divine Yin stone on this island, so naturally I have never seen it.
与其就这样苟活在这极阴之地，倒不如冒点风险，日子还能多点盼头。¤Rather than just living in this extremely Yin place, it is better to take some risks and have more to look forward to.
在下一直在这岛上寻找神阴石，自然是没见过幽厄。¤I have been on this island in search of the Divine Yin Stone, so naturally I have never seen the You Er.
一名魂体在不远处好似在搜寻什么东西。你飞上前去，打算问出点关于幽厄的消息。¤A spirit body seems to be searching for something not far away. You flew up to him, intending to ask for some information about the UFO.
本座前来剿灭幽厄，诸位可知它现在何方？¤I have come to exterminate the Evil, do you know where it is now?
他感应到你的威压之后，停下了手头的事情。¤He stopped what he was doing after sensing your intimidation.
不收集足够的神阴石，便会失去在阴魂岛上修炼的资格，更不用说换取那复生秘术了。¤If you don't collect enough divine Yin stones, you will lose the qualification to cultivate on the Island of Yin Souls, not to mention exchanging for the secret art of rejuvenation.
一名魂体在不远处好似在搜寻什么东西。你飞上前去，询问关于幽厄的消息。¤A spirit appears to be searching for something a short distance away. You fly up and ask for news about the spectre.
在下受岛主之托前来剿灭幽厄，道友可知它现在何方？¤I was entrusted by the island master to come to eliminate the evil, do you know where it is now?
只是此獠神出鬼没，除非是亲眼见它吞噬魂体，否则前辈可能很难发现它。¤It's just that this fang is so unpredictable that it may be difficult for seniors to spot it unless they have seen it devouring soul bodies with their own eyes.
在下受岛主之托前来剿灭幽厄，诸位可知它现在何方？¤I was entrusted by the island master to come and destroy the evil, do you know where it is now?
他们大都阴沉着脸，一副不太想搭理你的样子，只有领头一人回应你。¤Most of them are gloomy and look like they don't really want to talk to you, and only the leader one responds to you.
不远处一些魂体匆匆飞过。你飞上前去，询问关于幽厄的消息。¤Not far away some souls fly by hurriedly. You flew up and asked about the news of the Ursa Major.
只可惜我等并未见到幽厄，否则也见不到前辈了。¤It's just a pity that we did not see the Yu Er, otherwise we would not have seen elder either.
一瞬间四双眼睛直勾勾地朝你看来，凌厉的眼光似是要把你生吞活剥了般凶狠。¤In an instant, four pairs of eyes looked straight at you, and the sharp eyes seemed to swallow you alive.
有了！千年前有邪修擅研阵道，所施阵术皆邪祟诡秘，这阵法看来与那邪修所用有些相通之处。¤Yes! Thousands of years ago, there were an evil cultivator who were good at researching formations, and the formation techniques that cultivator used were all evil and mysterious. This formation seems to have some similarities with that evil cultivator's techniques.
大概是那阵法被你破解的原因，第一次来到圣坛时所见的冗长台阶已经消失不见，取而代之的是盘旋交错的几圈阶梯，想必当时连家管事便是在此迷阵中带你绕来绕去。¤It's probably the reason why you cracked the formation. The long steps that you saw when you first came to the altar have disappeared. Instead, there are several circles of steps that circled and staggered. It must be the reason why the housekeeper was in the confusion at the time. To take you around.
这阵法倒是有些熟悉，待老夫细细想来...¤This formation is a bit familiar, wait for the old man to think about it...
也不知这元神和他们结了什么仇...该不会是像我一样知晓千流岛秘密之人吧？¤I don't know what kind of hatred this soul has with them...Could it be someone who knows the secrets of Qianliu Island like me?
这阵法...他们似乎在对付那个元神，趁他们还没做好撤阵的准备解决了他们！¤This formation... they seem to be dealing with that soul. Let finish all of them before they are ready to withdraw from the formation!
老头儿，这阵法可有破解的方法？直接把那骨钉拔掉就没问题了？¤Old man, is there a way to crack this formation? Is it okay to just pull out the bone nail?
你解决他们后后来到石坛前，仔细端详着上面的阵法。刺骨的寒意向你袭来，霎时间令你感觉元神仿佛都要被这阵寒意冻住。¤After you solve them, go to the stone altar and carefully examine the formation on it. The biting chill hits you, and in a flash, you feel that your soul seems to be frozen by this chill.
看上去他们正在举行某种仪式，你的突然出现显然打扰了仪式的进行。¤It looks like they are performing some kind of ritual, and your sudden appearance obviously interrupted the ritual.
我乃无心闯入此地的修士，倒是您为何被困于此？¤I am a cultivator who broke into this place unintentionally, but why are you trapped here?
他秘术已修练完成，如今也不再需要我的元神，便打算叫几个心腹将本座炼化。¤His secret technique has been completed, and now I no longer need my soul, so he plans to ask a few confidants to refine this seat.
法阵中央的元神虚弱地闪动着，你一时不知道怎么解决，只好向剑中的魏无极求助。¤The primordial spirit in the center of the magic circle flickered weakly. You don't know how to solve it for a while, so you have to ask Wei Wuji in the sword for help.
圣坛依旧灵气充盈，只不过你似乎闯入的时机不对，石坛周围端坐着几位连家修士，他们正中围起来的祭台上八颗骨钉整齐地按八卦的方位排开，一抹惨淡森白的元神在中央摇曳着。¤The altar is still full of spiritual energy, but you seem to have broken in at the wrong time. There are several cultivators sitting around the stone altar. On the altar surrounded by them, eight bone nails are neatly arranged in the direction of the gossip. A bleak and white soul swayed in the center.
正是，想来你将阵法破除后这虚弱的元神才有能力与你沟通。¤Exactly, this weak primordial spirit will have the ability to communicate with you after you break the formation.
你心头一震，先前你明明是受连盛平指引来此地修练秘术才被坑害，他的元神又怎会在此处被困百千年？¤Your heart is shocked. Before, you were clearly entrapped by Lian Shengping who came here to practice secret techniques. How could his soul be trapped here for hundreds of years?
你手脚利落地把八颗骨钉拆除，中央的元神肉眼可见地凝实了几分，可谓成效卓越。¤You removed the eight bone nails neatly with your hands and feet, and the primordial soul in the center has been visibly consolidated a bit with the naked eye, which is an excellent result.
你飞快地跳下石阶来到圣坛的门前，轻车熟路地进入了门内。¤You quickly jumped off the stone steps to the door of the altar, and entered the door with ease.
你飞身而起，径直向那四人攻去。由于阵法的限制，那几位修士束手束脚，和你走了几招便败于马下。¤You flew up and went straight to attack the four. Due to the limitation of the formation, the cultivators were restrained, and after a few moves with you, they were defeated.
不知小友何人...？¤I don't know who the little friend...?
元神的声音听起来苍老又无力，似是年迈修士所持有。¤The voice of the primordial spirit sounds old and weak, and it seems to be held by an elderly cultivator.
其上布置的骨钉是为锁住元神，令其不得逃脱。阵法所绘咒纹...哼，饶你修为再强，元神置入此阵犹如烈火油烹，端是狠辣无边！¤The bone nails on it are designed to lock the primordial spirit so that it cannot escape. The curse pattern painted by the formation...huh, if you have a strong cultivation base, the primordial spirit being placed in this formation is like a fire and oil cooking. Spicy!
若我助前辈夺回身体，前辈能否保证日后的千流岛不会对供奉施此毒术？¤If I help senior to regain his body, can senior guarantee that Qianliu Island will not use this poisonous technique on guest elders in the future?
正交谈时魔修假冒的岛主从一旁冲出，向你袭来。想必是他已感知阵法被毁，前来探查消息。¤During the conversation, the evil cultivator impersonating the island owner rushed out from the side and attacked you. He must have sensed the destruction of the array and came to investigate.
得了岛主的承诺，你将体内灵气平缓地输给岛主的元神，只见那摇曳的灵体又结实了些。¤With the promise of the island owner, you will gently lose the aura in your body to the soul of the island owner, and you can see that the swaying spirit body is stronger again.
嗯~还不错嘛，你{xiaozi}有前途。¤Well ~ not bad, you {xiaozi} have a future.
（一脸无奈）师尊，这位就是{FirstName}{LastName}{FirstName}{shidi}，在您外出的时候可是帮了不少忙呢。¤(with a helpless face) Master, this is {FirstName}{LastName}{FirstName}{shidi}, who was a great help to you when you were away.
据传乃是上古妖圣的传承，经历九次涅槃，不仅能恢复暗伤易经伐髓调整资质，也可以修为更进一层。¤It is rumoured to be the inheritance of an ancient demon saint, experiencing nine times of nirvana, which not only restores dark wounds, eases the meridian and adjusts the qualifications, but also allows for a higher level of cultivation.
师尊~¤Master~
多谢前辈出手相救。¤Thank you for coming to my rescue.
不过温养这涅槃凰火甚是耗费资源，即使以离火门地脉之力尚且不足，还需要5品以上的木系妖丹和梧桐木作为燃料。¤However, the Nirvana Phoenix Flame is very resource-intensive, even with the power of the Heavenly Fire Gate's earth veins, it is still not enough, and it also requires wood demon pellets of the 5th grade or higher and Parasol wood as fuel.
得魔焰真君传授习得《九转涅槃诀》，之后更是获得异火涅槃凰火以此布下凤火涅槃阵，施展凤凰涅槃用以疗伤。¤He was taught the Nine Revolutions Nirvana Technique by the Demon Flame Monarch and later obtained the Nirvana Phoenix Flame to set up the Phoenix Flame Nirvana Formation and perform Phoenix Nirvana to heal his injuries.
我考虑了一下，还是不告诉你了，毕竟是主人的秘密。¤I've given it some thought, but I'd rather not tell you, after all, it's the master's secret.
哼，你{xiaozi}勇气可嘉，这神识修为可就不咋地了。¤Humph, you {xiaozi} are courageous, this soul sense cultivation is not so good.
{FirstName}{shidi}，失陪了。¤{FirstName}{shidi}, excuse me.
凤凰涅槃乃是兵解重生之道，本就是向死而生、一个漫长而危险的过程，《涅槃诀》也是以此由师尊所创。¤The Phoenix Nirvana is the way of rebirth, a long and dangerous process of death and rebirth, and it is in this way that the Nirvana Technique was created by the Master.
嘎嘎嘎，天蟾子怎么有人和你一样笨啊。¤Gah gah gah, how can anyone be as dumb as you are, Sky Toad.
“外出”两字要得格外的重。¤The word ''out'' is used with extra emphasis.
刚一进门，一阵威压笼罩了你。抬头看去，麒麟正盯着你。¤As soon as you enter, a wave of intimidation envelops you. When you look up, the unicorn is staring at you.
呶，拿着！我可是赏罚分明的。¤Look, take it! I'm a good judge of punishment.
你感到眼前的麒麟一阵气血翻涌。¤You feel a surge of qi and blood in front of you.
嘿嘿，{xiaoz}你不好奇么？叫声炎鹤大人，我可以勉为其难的考虑告诉你发生了什么？¤Hey, {xiaoz} aren't you curious? Call out for Lord Yanhe and I can reluctantly consider telling you what happened?
主人，您的伤？¤Your injury, my lord?
那敢问炎鹤大人，麟尊这是？¤Then dare I ask Lord Yanhe, is this the Lin Zun?
师徒两人开启禁制直奔地下，现在现场就留着你和两只灵兽六目相对。¤Master and disciple open the ban and go straight underground, now the scene is left to you and the two spirit beasts with six eyes on each other.
{FirstName}{shidi}真的是抱歉了，情况突发。¤{FirstName}{shidi}I'm really sorry for the unexpected situation.
唉，您和火凰前辈也真是....¤Lol, you and the Fire Phoenix seniors are really ....
哈哈哈，{xiaozi}我们见过哦。不过那时候，你可太狼狈了，一个古神教的小耗子就把你逼入绝境了。¤Hahahaha, {xiaozi} we've met oh. But back then, you were so wretched that a little rat from the Ancient Gods Sect drove you into a corner.
你感到元神仿佛置于重重烈火中炙烤一般。忽然压力一松。¤You feel as if your genitals have been placed in a heavy blazing fire and roasted. Suddenly the pressure is relieved.
{shidi}若是有多余的，我绝焰堂必有重谢。¤{shidi}If there are any extras, we, the Absolute Flame Hall, will be very grateful.
钟师兄客气了。¤Brother Zhong is very kind.
师傅曾被古神教伏击，幸而被魔焰真君所救，只是对方所用秘术甚是诡异，竟伤及本源。¤My master was once ambushed by the Ancient Gods Sect and was fortunately saved by the Devil's Flame, but the secret techniques used by the other side were so bizarre that they injured his origin.
我来开启凤火涅槃阵，炎鹤，天蟾子你们就镇守密库大门。¤I will open the Phoenix Fire Nirvana Formation, while Yanhe and Tianfanzi will guard the secret vault door.
探头看去，入口处有一块巨石，上书“焚天”二字。即使是岁月的流逝令其上灵气已经几近溃散，但你仍能感受到一阵灼热的火之道韵。¤Looking around, there is a huge stone at the entrance with the word ''Burning Heaven'' written on it. Even though its aura has nearly dissipated over the years, you can still feel a burning rhythm of the fire.
这洞府看起来年代很久了，连最基础的聚灵阵都有些维持不住了。¤The cave looks so old that even the most basic spirit gathering formation is somewhat untenable.
这一缕道韵必是在火之道上已是大道已成的强者留下的。¤This wisp of dao rhyme must have been left behind by a powerful person who was already a Daoist in the Way of Fire.
你眼前是一根细柱，一条金龙盘旋刻于其上，时不时有雷霆涌过。¤In front of you is a thin column, a golden dragon hovering engraved on it, from time to time there are thunder surges.
这应该就是传闻之中九霄雷狱阵的阵眼引雷柱了吧，有机会可以交换给龙族。¤This should be the rumors of the nine heavenly thunder prison Array of the eye of the Array to lead the thunder pillar, there is an opportunity to exchange to the dragon tribe.
你花费了一些时日，在附近布下了数个相互连锁的阵法，现在就等鱼儿上钩了...¤You spent some time and laid out several interlocking formations nearby, and now you are waiting for the fish to get the bait...
你连忙向那边赶去，刚好撞见正准备逃离此地的邪修。你遁速轻灵，很快便追上了他。¤You rushed over there, just when you ran into the evil cultivator who was about to escape from here. You were quick and light, and you soon followed him.
你找了个隐蔽之处藏身，阵法笼罩下，所有人的一举一动皆在你的掌控之中。¤You found a concealed place to hide, under the envelopment of the formation, everyone's every move is under your control.
哪里跑！¤Where to run!
整整过了一个月，也没有发生任何异动，反倒是你布下的阵法中有好几个不知何时已经被人破坏。¤A whole month has passed, and no changes have occurred. On the contrary, several of the formations you have laid out have been destroyed at some point in time.
一道灵气波动从背后传来，你早就防备，闪身避开。¤A wave of spiritual energy came from behind, you have long been guarded, dodge and avoid it.
没过多久，你便发现有一人鬼鬼祟祟地跟着其它散修，正当他想要出手时，你抢先一步向他攻去！¤It didn't take long for you to find someone sneakyly following other independent cultivators. Just when he wanted to make a move, you attacked him first!
此人多喜欢对修为低下，且独自出行的散修动手。我只需隐藏自己的修为后四处走动，或许就能引蛇出洞。¤This person often likes to attack lone independent cultivators with low-level of cultivation. I only need to hide my cultivation level and walk around, maybe I can lure him into attacking me.
若是我能实现在附近几个重要的地点布下感应阵法，一旦有人在阵中出手，便可立即感知。只要那人还敢在此地出手，定能将他拿下！¤If I can set up a sensing array at several important places nearby, once someone takes a shot in the array, I can immediately perceive it. As long as that person dares to take a shot here, he will definitely be taken down!
整整过了一个月，也没有发生任何异动，或许是你在不经意间已经惊动了那人，自己却完全没有发现。¤A whole month has passed without any changes. Perhaps you have inadvertently alarmed the person, but you didn't notice it at all.
你每日在附近巡视，这天晚上，一阵轻微的灵气波动引起了你的注意，似乎有什么人正在附近战斗。¤You are patrolling the neighborhood every day. That night, a slight spiritual fluctuation caught your attention. It seems that someone is fighting nearby.
错过了这次机会后，你始终未能再次找到那名传闻中的邪修，只能悻悻然离开了这里。¤After you missed this opportunity, you still failed to find the rumored evil cultivator again, so you can only leave here sadly.
此人对于阵法造诣犹在你之上，你始终未能找到那名传闻中的邪修，只能悻悻然离开了这里。¤This person's knowledge of the formation is still higher than you. You have never found the rumored evil cultivator, so you can only leave here sadly.
你连忙向那边赶去，刚好撞见正准备逃离此地的邪修。此人不知修炼了何等遁术，速度奇快，几息之间便将你远远甩在身后。¤You hurried over there, just when you ran into the evil cultivator who was about to escape from here. This person did not know how much he had practiced, and he was so fast that he left you far behind in a few breaths.
你故意压低修为，装作独自在附近搜寻草药的散修，但暗中一直保持警惕...¤You deliberately lowered the cultivation base, pretending to be an independent cultivator alone searching for herbs nearby, but you have remained vigilant secretly...
那杀人夺宝者通常都是在这附近的区域动的手...该怎么找到他呢？¤The killer and the treasure hunter usually use their hands in the area around here...how do you find him?
先四处巡视探查一番吧。若那人还敢在此地出手，被我看到，定能将他拿下！¤Let’s go around and check it out first. If that person dared to make a move here, and I saw him, he would definitely be taken down!
整整过了一个月，也没有发生任何异动。你运气不佳，始终未能找到那名传闻中的邪修，只能悻悻然离开了这里。¤A whole month has passed without any changes. You are out of luck and have not been able to find the rumored evil cultivator, so you can only leave here sadly.
嗖！¤Whoo!
此人神识修为犹在你之上，你始终未能找到那名传闻中的邪修，只能悻悻然离开了这里。¤This person's spiritual consciousness cultivation is still above you. You have not been able to find the rumored evil cultivator, so you can only leave here sadly.
你决定留在此地碰碰运气，说不定那人自己便会找上门来。¤You decide to stay here and try your luck, maybe that person will come by himself.
很快，你便能飞升上界，觅得长生，与天地同寿，成为真正的仙人！¤Soon, you will be able to ascend to the upper realms, find long life, live with heaven and earth, and become a true immortal!
闭上眼睛，从未如此闲适逍遥，你知道，你将寿敝天地，无有终时，这是自古以来亿万修士的夙愿。¤Close your eyes, you have never been so free and relaxed, you know that you will live without end in heaven and earth, the long-cherished wish of millions of cultivators since ancient times.
你向远处望去，看着人群中一张张你熟悉的，或是陌生的面孔。此时此刻，你只觉得...¤You look into the distance and see a familiar or unfamiliar face in the crowd. At this moment, you just feel...
是魏无极？他终于重塑了肉身，却又把自己弄成了一副老者的模样...你不禁觉得有些好笑。¤Is it Wei Wuji? He's finally reshaped his flesh, but he's made himself look like an old man again... You can't help but feel a little amused.
你做到了。¤You did it.
炊烟点点，遁光依旧，灵舟破浪，商旅徐行...一切都已恢复了平静，人们继续忙碌着，草木继续生长着，宁州还是宁州，大海还是大海...¤The smoke is still there, the light is still there, the boats are still breaking the waves, the merchants are still moving... Everything has returned to peace, people continue to go about their business, grass and trees continue to grow, Ning Province is still Ning Province, the sea is still the sea...
想到这里，你不由得放声大笑起来。¤You can't help but let out a big laugh at the thought of it.
此刻，你只觉得内心按捺不住的兴奋，千百年来的苦修、所经所历的一切，都终于有了回报。\n¤At this moment, you just feel the uncontrollable excitement inside you that everything you have cultivated and experienced for thousands of years has finally paid off. \n
浮生若梦，过往的点滴回忆好似走马灯一般在你识海中逐个闪过......¤The past is like a dream, and the memories of the past seem to flash through your mind one by one ......

你向远处望去，依稀见到几个陌生的面孔带着敬畏的神情远远的望向这里。此时此刻，你只觉得...¤You look into the distance and vaguely see a few unfamiliar faces looking away with awe. At this moment, you just feel...
云销雨霁，彩彻区明。万道光柱穿破云层，轻轻地洒在了地面上......¤The clouds cleared and the rain cleared, and the colours were clear through the district. A million pillars of light pierced through the clouds and gently spilled onto the ground ......

哈哈哈，这次还是哥哥我略胜一筹啊。¤Hahaha, this time I'm still a little better, brother.

没想到此行竟生如此事端...抱歉，道友，我还要与族中共议大事。¤I didn't expect this trip to be such an incident... Sorry, fellow Taoist, I still have to discuss major issues with the CCP.
没想到魔门竟已渗透进宁州...如此看来大变将至啊...¤Unexpectedly, the Demon Sect has penetrated into Ning Province... so it seems that a big change is coming...

呵呵，好说，那道友便小心了。¤Hehe, it's easy to say, that Daoist friend should be careful.

原来是小友……不知近来小友修为可有提升？¤It turned out to be a little friend... I wonder if the little friend's cultivation has improved recently?
说罢，吞云大圣便开始运起了功法，四周顿时云雾环绕。你每有不甚明白的地方，吞云大圣都一一为你讲解。整套功法演练完，竟已过去了一天一夜。¤After all, the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud began to use the exercises, and the surrounding was suddenly surrounded by clouds and mists. Whenever there is something you don’t quite understand, the Great Sage Swallowing Cloud will explain it to you one by one. After the whole exercise was completed, a day and a night had passed.
无尽海渊的九幽大圣，居然还会使用阵法……¤The Great Sage of the Nine Nethers of the Endless Sea, actually still uses the formation technique...
我这段时间积累了一些心得体会，正好与道友交流一番罢。¤During this period of time, I have accumulated some experience and experience, which is just in time to communicate with fellow Daoists.
近来技痒，想与大圣切磋一番¤Recently, I have been itching for skills, and I want to learn from the great sage.
浪方海那浪方大圣，竟能施展吞噬秘术将人一口吞下……¤The Great Sage of Langfanghai, Langfang, was able to use the Secret Art of Devouring to swallow people in one bite...
即便我全力出手，想要破开位面裂隙也难以做到，可想而知当年那场大战的规模。¤Even if I do my best, it will be difficult to break through the cracks in the plane. One can imagine the scale of that battle.
纵然他针上所附之物伤不到我，但我也拿他毫无办法，倒也算他小胜一筹。¤Even though the thing attached to his needle can't hurt me, but I can't do anything with him, it's a small victory for him.
已习得《{color=red}玄武吐纳术{/color}》¤Acquired {color=red}Black Tortoise Breathing Technique{/color}
你讲述了在无尽海渊与九幽大圣斗智斗勇的经历。¤You told about the experience of fighting wits and courage with the Nine Nether Great Sage in the endless sea.
若今日能再战一场……唉，罢了。¤If we can have another battle today ......, it's just.
你向他绘声绘色地讲述了你在宁州古迹的经历。¤You told him vividly about your experience in Ning Province historic site.
不错，道友竟突破到了化神期。¤Yes, fellow Daoist actually broke through to the Deity Transformation Stage.
道友谬赞了，既然阁下也是化神修为，何须我来指点？¤Fellow Daoist praised it wrongly. Since your Excellency is also a Deity Transformation cultivator, why do you need me to give pointers?
你二人聊了聊往事，作为修仙路上的消遣倒也不错。¤The two of you talked about the past, which is not bad as a pastime on the road to immortality.
可惜最近没有什么心得体会，只得陪道友叙叙旧了。¤It's a pity that I haven't experienced anything recently, so I have to accompany my fellow Daoists to catch up.
不过若我进入那古战场中，倒是有自信抵抗那煞气千年。¤However, if I entered the ancient battlefield, I would have the confidence to resist the evil spirit for thousands of years.
只是刚好路过，来看看道友罢了。¤I just happened to pass by to see fellow Daoists.
这是……如此珍贵的功法，为何这般传授于我？¤This is... such a precious practice, why was it taught to me like this?
你二人畅谈了许久，双方都收益颇丰。¤The two of you talked for a long time, and both of them benefited a lot.
只有修炼过瞳术才能看见？此等经历，若不是道友告知，只怕此生都无机会知晓。¤Can you see only if you have practiced pupil art? If this experience is not told by fellow Daoists, I am afraid that I will never have the chance to know it in this life.
你可知道，无尽之海最南端有三片阴气浓郁的海域……¤Did you know that there are three sea areas with strong Yin Qi at the southernmost end of the Endless Sea...
哈哈哈，一般妖兽若无血脉优势，本无机会突破化神，这九幽也算是得到了一些了不得的机缘。¤Hahaha, if ordinary monsters don't have the advantage of bloodline, they have no chance to break through to Deity Transformation, and this Jiuyou can be regarded as getting some incredible opportunities.
这个，大圣一试便知。¤This, the Great Sage will know after a try.
道友与我相交也不浅了，这便是我族祖传功法玄武吐纳术。切记，此功法莫要外传。¤My fellow Daoist and I have been in close contact with each other. This is the Black Tortoise Breathing Technique, which was handed down from our clan’s ancestors. Remember, this practice should not be spread out.
你讲述了在极阴三海上所发生的故事。¤You recount the story of what happened on the Three Seas of Extreme Yin.
他的遁术相当高明，与他的飞针术配合简直完美无缺。¤His evasion technique was quite brilliant, and it was simply perfect in conjunction with his flying needle technique.
哦？原来是道友。许久不见，可有带来什么奇闻异事？¤Oh? It was a Taoist friend. Long time no see, have you brought anything strange?
吞云大圣盛名已久，自然是有过人之处。¤The Great Sage of Swallowing Clouds has been famous for a long time, and naturally he has something special.
好，那便由本座来检验一二吧。¤Well, then let me check one or two.
百余年前本座曾与九幽起过一些冲突，没想到同为化神期修为，他居然未曾出手便逃回他的老巢去了。如此一来，本座倒也不屑于再与他有何争斗了。¤More than a hundred years ago, this seat had some conflicts with Jiuyou. I didn't expect that he was also in the Deity Transformation stage, and he fled back to his lair without taking a shot. In this way, this seat doesn't bother to fight with him any more.
不必谦虚，化神境有多难突破，你我心知肚明……不知道友来此所谓何事？¤You don't have to be humble, you and I know how difficult it is to break through to Deity Transformation... I don't know what You Lai is talking about?
我听闻鹤真人曾与你切磋过……¤I heard that the real Crane had sparred with you ......
九嶷山此地的修士数量并不少，但大多是前往灵气充沛的山峰收集草药。¤The number of cultivators here on Jiuyi Mountain is not small, but most of them travel to peaks with abundant spiritual energy to collect herbs.
不过，与其说那人是在此地疗伤，倒更像是在等什么人。¤However, it was more like the man was waiting for someone than that he was here to heal.
{$daihao}，敛息凝神...他应该就在这附近了。¤{$daihao}, gather your breath and concentrate... He should be around here now.
（还不知道这琚运琦到底想做什么，不如先假装不敌，逼他出手看看...）¤(We still don't know what this Ju Yunqi wants to do, so we might as well pretend we're outmatched and force him to make a move first...)
你和琚运琦却一路向着人烟稀少，灵气枯竭的地方走去，渐渐进入了山谷之中。¤You and Ju Yunqi, however, make your way towards a sparsely populated area where the aura is depleted, gradually entering the valley.
掩人耳目罢了，没什么可奇怪的。¤It's just a cover, nothing surprising.
你与琚运琦一同小心探查，果然在山谷中的一处隐蔽之地发现了那血剑宫长老的踪迹。¤Together with Ju Yunqi, you scouted carefully and found the trail of the Blood Sword Palace elder in a hidden place in the valley.
你正要动手，突然间却汗毛直立，一股杀意从你的背后袭来。¤You are about to make your move when suddenly your sweat stands on end and a killing intent comes from behind you.
一旦找到他，就立刻动手！¤As soon as we find him, let's do it!
你怎么在这？¤What are you doing here?
萧千绝涨红了脸，一副有气撒不出的样子。¤Xiao Qianjue's face turned red, and he looked as if he could not vent his anger.
才消停片刻，二人又开始争吵起来。¤After a moment's pause, the two began to argue again.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我们改日再会吧。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, let's meet again some other time.
你明知道我激发完灵气就力竭了，还分出个胜负？这不是欺负人麽？¤You know I'll be exhausted when I finish my aura, and you're still trying to determine a winner? Isn't that bullying?
你也没想他一言不合竟离开了此地，琢磨着会不会是自己的问题。¤You didn't expect him to leave the place at the drop of a hat and wondered if it could be his own fault.
哼，明年再来风雷谷吧。¤Heck, come back to Wind and Thunder Valley next year.
你也没想她一言不合竟离开了此地，琢磨着会不会是自己的问题。¤You didn't expect her to leave the place at the drop of a hat, wondering if it might be her own fault.
“此二人剑招之精妙，实乃生平罕见…”¤'The subtlety of these two's sword moves is rare in their lives...''
我见你杀意正浓，误以为是在死斗，方才出手相救。¤I saw your killing intent and mistook it for a deadly fight, so I came to your rescue.
漫天剑光一如飞雪舞天。那女修一退再退，眼看便要招架不住。¤The sword light was like flying snow dancing in the sky. The woman retreated again and again, looking like she was about to lose her grip.
……我觉得萧道友的剑更胜一筹。¤...... I think Daoist Xiao's sword is better.
虽说这个事实让你很是意外，不过既然打断了他们的比试，你还是表示了自己的歉意。¤You were surprised by this fact, but since you had interrupted their contest, you expressed your apologies.
可即便如此，此前消耗过度的灵气却是无法弥补，尽管招式再巧妙，也只能延缓她落败的时间罢了。¤But even so, the excessive consumption of her aura could not be compensated for, and despite the cleverness of her moves, it only delayed her defeat.
哪知道，最后我们打到灵气耗尽，竟然都没有分出胜负！¤What do you know, in the end, we fought until our aura ran out, but we didn't even distinguish the winner!
来者何人？何故打搅我二人切磋？¤Who is this man? Why are you interrupting our sparring session?
就当时情形而言，确实是他略胜一筹…¤In the circumstances, it is true that he was slightly better...
好奇之下，你收敛气息靠了过去，打算一探究竟。¤Curious, you gather your breath and lean over, intending to find out what's going on.
想当初他第一次来星河剑派的时候，姐妹们都当他不是什么正经人物，纷纷以一种异样的眼光看着他。¤When he first came to the Star River Sword School, the sisters all thought he was no decent person and looked at him with a strange look.
想不到你们还发生过这样的事，当真有趣！¤I can't believe this happened to you guys, it's funny!
你飞身相助，替那女修挡下了这一连串攻击。男修见状也强行收住了攻势。¤You flew to your aid and deflected the barrage of attacks for the female cultivator. Seeing this, the male cultivator also forces the attack to stop.
他们除了修为高以外，实战经验定然也相当不俗，否则不可能达到如此地步。¤Apart from their high cultivation level, they must also have considerable experience in actual combat, otherwise they could not have reached such a level.
哈哈哈哈，我们就是因为那次比试谁也不服谁，所以才有后面这么多的比试。¤Hahahahahaha, we just had so many competitions behind us because no one was convinced in that one.
这一比试，就比试到了现在…¤This competition has come to a head...
萧千绝自然也是不服，又找上了星河剑派，如此往复。¤Naturally, Xiao Qianjue was not convinced and approached the Xinghe Sword School again, and so on and so forth.
还有力气在这吹嘘，不如比试继续，我们分出个胜负，如何？¤Why don't we continue the contest and we'll see who wins and who loses?
萧千绝¤Xiao Qianjie
起初由于宗门大比在金虹剑派举行，第二年的比试便定在了风雷谷，结果却是萧千绝略胜一筹。¤Initially, as the clan competition was held at the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect, the second year's competition was set at the Wind and Thunder Valley, which turned out to be a slight victory for Xiao Qianjue.
“叮叮叮、叮叮、叮……”¤'Ding, ding, ding, ding ......''
虽说你对此毫无办法，不过就待在一旁听他们拌嘴，倒也别有一番趣味。¤There's nothing you can do about it, but it's fun to just sit back and listen to them bicker.
没想到竟然是你们两个…¤I never thought it would be you two...
…难道你们并非死斗，而是在切磋？¤...Could it be that you are not fighting to the death, but are sparring?
随着女修灵气率先耗尽，男修的剑陡然停下。原来二人并非死斗，只是切磋而已。¤As the female practitioner's aura was the first to run out, the male practitioner's sword came to a sudden halt. It turned out that they were not fighting to the death, but merely sparring.
慕容颖收回剑，像没事人一样问道。¤Murong Ying withdrew her sword and asked as if nothing was wrong.
谁知他摸了摸头，一脸尴尬的看着你，丝毫没有动手的意思，让你有种不好的预感。¤Who knows, he rubs his head and looks at you with an embarrassed face, without the slightest intention of doing anything, giving you a bad feeling.
…若我感应不错，此二人不过也是筑基修为，为何实力却是如此强劲？¤...If my senses are correct, these two are only at Foundation Establishment level, why are they so strong?
好，便依你这一回。¤Okay, I'll let you do it this time.
交换后，你们便各自离开了此地。¤After the exchange, you each left the place.
数息过去，那男修由攻转守，女修便趁此机会步步紧逼。¤After a few breaths had passed, the man switched from attack to defence, and the woman took advantage of the opportunity to press on.
变故转瞬即至，那男修隐约在胸口虚点两下，灵气便突然暴涨，顿觉杀意滔天。¤The change came in a flash, the male cultivator vaguely nodded twice on his chest, and his aura suddenly surged, and he felt a killing intent.
哼，死了也只能怪你学艺不精。¤Hmph, you can only be blamed for not learning your craft well enough when you die.
几次之后，二人干脆定下一个规矩，每年上一次的败者都要去胜者的后山比试。¤After a few times, the two simply made a rule that each year the loser of the last one had to go to the winner's backyard to compete.
嗯，我也正有此意。¤Well, that's exactly what I was thinking.
萧兄与慕容姑娘此番相互激励，想必对双方都大有裨益。¤This mutual motivation between Brother Xiao and Miss Murong must be of great benefit to both sides.
我先故意示弱，目的就是想诱敌深入，等她急于进攻，灵气都消耗的差不多了，我再出手。¤I first deliberately showed my weakness in order to bait the enemy deeper, and when she was eager to attack and her aura was all but depleted, I would strike again.
双方长老商议后，那场比赛最终以平局收场，我们被破例双双进入内门。¤After the elders of both sides deliberated, that match ended in a draw and we were given an exception to both enter the inner gate.
今日相谈甚欢，不如留下传音符印记，以便日后联系？¤We've had a good talk today, why don't we leave a voice transmission mark for future contact?
他们二人纷纷转头看向了你。¤The two of them have turned their heads to look at you.
慕容颖。¤Murong Ying.
回想起他刚刚的滔天杀意，你丝毫不觉得，这一切只是在切磋而已。¤Thinking back to the monstrous killing intent he just had, you don't get the slightest impression that it was all just a cut-up.
{FirstName}道友，依你之见，这次比试当属谁更胜一筹？¤{FirstName}Daoist, in your opinion, who is the better player in this competition?
舞剑二人竟都是你熟识之人，你当即明白了事情的原委。¤The two sword dancers are both people you know well, and you immediately understand what is going on.
那次宗门大比，回想起来也是过去不少年了。¤That clan competition, in retrospect, was quite a few years ago.
你身为金虹剑派首席大弟子，莫非想赖账不成？¤As the chief disciple of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect, do you want to renege on your debt?
最后大长老怕我们受伤，强行叫停了比赛。¤In the end the Grand Elder forced a halt to the game for fear of us getting hurt.
二人若论修为，乃是慕容颖更胜一筹，但萧千绝奇谋摆出，时常能以智取胜，所以胜负始终离不开五五之数。¤In terms of cultivation, Murong Ying is the better of the two, but Xiao Qianjue is so resourceful that he can often use his wits to win, so it's always a 50/50 split.
看他们的反应你便大抵猜到，八成是问到什么只有他们自己知道的事情了。¤You can guess by their reaction that they are probably asking about something that only they know.
可那男修却丝毫不惧，卸力、躲闪之下，反倒是攒下了不少灵气。¤But the male cultivator was not afraid at all, and with the unloading and dodging, he saved up a lot of aura instead.
得了吧，你灵气都快枯竭了，还破釜沉舟？¤Come on, you're running out of aura, and you're still busting at the seams?
{FirstName}道友以为，我这招破釜沉舟威力如何？¤{FirstName}What do you think of the power of my move to break the boat?
现在天色也不早了，我也要回去修养了。¤It's getting late now, and I'm going back to recuperate.
道友放心，萧千绝并非心胸狭隘之人，绝不会因此记恨与你，不过……¤You can rest assured that Xiao Qianjue is not a narrow-minded person and will never hold a grudge against you for this, but ......
此次比试确实是我疏忽大意了，若我当时没有急于进攻，转而积蓄剑意，或许还能建立些许优势。¤It is true that I was negligent and careless in this match. If I had not rushed to attack and instead built up my sword intent, I might have been able to build up some advantage.
只要我挺过这攻势，使出破釜沉舟，你必败无疑。¤If I survive this attack and make a break for it, you will be defeated.
要是她来连石山的话，那倒是无所谓，平局我也认了。¤If she had come to Liangshi Mountain, it wouldn't have mattered, I would have accepted a draw.
言罢，他又自顾自地讲起了这些年比试的故事。¤After speaking, he went on to tell himself the story of the competitions over the years.
“轰隆——”{vpunch=10,0.5}¤'Boom-'' {vpunch=10,0.5}
在下{FirstName}{LastName}，敢问二位怎么称呼？¤I am {FirstName}{LastName}, may I ask what you call yourselves?
那时我们才十二、三岁，却都步入了炼气后期，便不约而同地参加了那次的宗门大比。¤At that time, we were only 12 or 13 years old, but we had both stepped into the late stage of Qi refinement, so we participated in the clan competition together.
现在天色已晚，我再不回去修炼便又要被师尊奚落了…¤It's getting late now, so if I don't go back to practice I'll be taunted by my master again...
看见相救乃是熟识之人，你有点庆幸自己选择出手相助。¤Seeing that the rescue was from someone you know well, you are a little glad you chose to help.
…这是为何？¤...Why is this?
我们击败了大我们许多的炼气巅峰修士，一路过关斩将，最后竟在决赛相遇了。¤We defeated peak Qi refining cultivator much older than us and made it all the way through to meet in the final.
慕容颖不服，第三年又找上了金虹剑派，二人便又在连石山比试了一场，这次却是慕容颖胜了。¤In the third year, Murong Ying was not convinced and approached the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect again, and they had another match at Lian Shi Mountain.
慕容颖，咱们明年连石山见！¤Murong Ying, see you next year at Liangshi Mountain!
舞剑之人竟是你熟识之人，你当即明白了事情的原委。¤The man who danced with the sword was someone you knew well, and you immediately understood what was going on.
胜便是胜、败便是败。真到了危难时刻，便是你死我亡，怎会有平局出现？¤A win is a win and a loss is a loss. In times of crisis, it is a matter of death and death, so how can there be a draw?
瞧你那副小人得志的样子…¤Look at you, with your petty attitude...
平局的话，那明年到底是我去风雷谷，还是她来连石山？¤If it's a draw, then will I go to Wind and Thunder Valley next year, or will she come to Liangshi Mountain?
那次比试？¤That competition?
这…莫不是我说错了话？¤This...could it be that I said the wrong thing?
…道友误会了，我二人确实是在切磋，只是早已熟悉彼此的招式与实力，所以才敢全力以赴。¤...Fellow Daoist misunderstood, the two of us were indeed sparring, only that we had long been familiar with each other's stances and strengths, so we dared to go all out.
嗯…{FirstName}道友恐怕是误会了，我二人只是在切磋而已，并无恶意。¤Well...{FirstName}Daoist friends are afraid that they have misunderstood, the two of us are just sparring and have no malicious intent.
你们又聊了许久，不觉间天色已是渐晚。¤You talked for a long time more, and before you knew it it was getting late.
眼看二人争执不下，你便想着当一回和事佬。¤When you see that the two of you are arguing, you try to be a peacemaker.
既然{FirstName}道友如此说，我也毫无怨言。¤Since {FirstName}Daoist said so, I have no complaints.
她略微转过头，脸上难以察觉到地泛起了一丝微红。¤She turned her head slightly, a slight blush imperceptibly flushing her face.
你认识？¤You know?
可是，你们不是曾经有过一次平局嘛？¤But didn't you have a draw once?
虽说方才那架势，任谁来都决不可能看出只是切磋而已，不过既然打断了他们的比试，你还是表示了自己的歉意。¤Although the stance of the party was such that no one would ever be able to tell that it was just a sparring match, you still expressed your apologies since you had interrupted their contest.
见识过我的破釜沉舟后，你怎敢断言{FirstName}道友还会这样认为？¤Having seen me break the ice, how dare you assert that {FirstName}Daoists will still think so?
抱歉，是在下唐突了……¤Sorry, it was a surprise ......
她也就资质比我高一些而已，单比剑法怎么可能是我的对手？¤She is only a little more qualified than me, so how can she be my match in swordplay alone?
你忌惮被他们二人发现，便没有太过靠近，只是停在约莫二十丈开外静待事态发展。¤Scared of being discovered by the two of them, you don't get too close and just stop about 20 feet away to wait for developments to take place.
依我看，两位实力相差无几，这场比试就当作平局如何？¤In my opinion, the difference in strength between the two of you is not much, so how about we call this match a draw?
萧千绝。¤Xiao Qianjue.
那这场比试可就算我赢了，现在我对你{$胜利次数}胜，{$失败次数}败，一平。¤Then this match can be won by me, now I win against you {$victory count}, {$loss count} defeat, one draw.
一声巨响，萧千绝身后的树已然被笔直劈成两半，地面也被劈出一条长坑，而他却早早地闪到了一旁。¤With a loud bang, the tree behind Xiao Qianjue had been split in half straight and a long crater had been made in the ground, while he had dodged to the side long ago.
{FirstName}道友，我们改日再会罢。¤{FirstName}Daoist, let's meet again some other time.
言罢，他便踏剑离开了此地。¤With those words, he stepped on his sword and left the place.
慕容颖¤Murong Ying
我从小便苦修星河剑法，就算单论剑法也是我胜。¤I have trained hard in the Star River Sword Technique since I was a child, and even in terms of swordplay alone, I am the winner.
再回过神来，那二人早已离开，你也当即离开了此地。¤When you look back again, the two are long gone and you leave the place at once.
听到你的疑问，他们先是愣了一下，又相互看了一眼，最后纷纷笑出声来。¤At your query, they freeze for a moment, look at each other again, and finally burst out laughing.
他费劲口舌解释的样子，现在回想起来都觉得好笑。¤The way he struggled to explain himself is funny in retrospect.
两人异口同声，果断地出人意料。¤The two men spoke in unison, decisively and surprisingly.
要不是觉得你顶不住我最后的攻势，{FirstName}{xiongdi}也不会贸然出手了，你说是吧？¤If I didn't think you wouldn't be able to withstand my final attack, {FirstName}{xiongdi} wouldn't have rushed in, would you?
…不过？¤...but?
{FirstName}道友？¤{FirstName}Daoist?
没想到竟然是萧兄…¤I never thought it would be Brother Xiao...
你将慕容颖保护在身后，警惕地看着那名男修。¤You protect Murong Ying behind you and watch the male cultivator warily.
还好我不久就突破了筑基，立马就赢回了颜面。¤Luckily, I broke through the foundation shortly afterwards and immediately won back face.
言罢，她便踏剑离开了此地。¤With those words, she stepped on her sword and left the place.
大言不惭…¤Big words...
慕容姐，我来助你。¤Sister Murong, I'm here to help you.
放心，慕容颖虽然小气，但是没那么小气，这点小事她不会放在心上的。¤Don't worry, although Murong Ying is petty, she's not that petty, she won't take this little thing to heart.
道别后，你们便各自离开了此地。¤After saying your goodbyes, you each left the area.
那可不行，这场明明是我赢了。你承认自己中计就这么难吗？¤That's not good. I won this one. Is it so hard to admit you've been tricked?
你沉浸在剑招中，仿佛领悟到了一丝剑意之门道。¤You are immersed in a sword move, as if you have comprehended a glimpse of the doorway of sword intent.
一阵急促的剑刃相交声传来，远方交战的动静不小，想必是发生了什么变故。\t¤A sharp clash of swords and blades came from a distant engagement, and the commotion of the battle was not small, so I think something has changed. \t
修为高低与实力强弱本就不是必然关系。若是只会修枯禅，就算修到筑基巅峰，也不见得能胜过炼气修士。¤The level of cultivation is not necessarily related to strength. If one only cultivates Kuchan, even if one reaches the peak of Foundation Establishment, one may not be able to outperform Qi Refining cultivators.
刚刚那股杀意，分明是要取人性命，哪里是切磋的架势？¤That killing intent just now was clearly intended to take someone's life, where was the stance of a sparring match?
喂，你干嘛？这招要真打到可是要死人的！¤Hey, what are you doing? You'll kill someone if you hit him with that!
风雷谷就风雷谷，明年等着瞧好了。¤Wind and Thunder Valley is Wind and Thunder Valley, just wait and see next year.
约莫一炷香的时间，他们又吵回了最开始孰胜孰负的问题。¤For about an incense burner, they bickered back to the question of who had won or lost at the beginning.
不过我想到他得意的样子就来气，何况我也不是没有反败为胜的机会，就这样便算他胜也太便宜他了。¤But I was angry at the way he looked so pleased with himself, and it wasn't as if I didn't have a chance to turn the tables on him.
刀光剑影！一男一女正在远处竹林中交战。其身法之迅速，快到你甚至看不清他们的动作与容貌。¤Swords and swords! A man and a woman are fighting in a bamboo forest in the distance. Their stances are so swift that you can't even see their movements or their faces.
而且这次切磋确实是我更胜一筹，她肯定也知道这一点，之前跟我吵只是因为死要面子而已。¤And it's true that I was the better sparring partner this time, and she must have known that, arguing with me earlier just because she was dead set on saving face.
她一招一式力道都极重，似能断水摧山，若是寻常修士，接她半招恐怕都要拼尽全力。¤Every move she made was extremely heavy, seemingly capable of breaking water and destroying mountains. If it were an ordinary cultivator, I'm afraid I would have had to use all my strength to receive half of her moves.
切磋？¤Cutting?
我看你修为没什么长进，嘴上功夫倒是长进不少……¤I see that your cultivation has not improved much, but your mouth has improved a lot ......
当时我们还不认识，看见对方只是小屁孩，就完全没放在眼里。¤We didn't know each other at the time and when we saw that the other person was just a kid, we didn't give it a second thought at all.
只见女修一转剑意，变得柔韧婉约起来，一招一式也能化险为夷。¤I only saw the female cultivator turn her sword intent, becoming soft and gentle, and turning even a single move into a dangerous one.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，刚刚你应该都看见了吧？¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, you should have seen it all just now, right?
她的语气冷淡中夹杂着一丝不屑。¤Her tone was cold with a hint of disdain.
好，我也正有此意！¤Good, that's what I was thinking!
先不说这个，刚刚要不是你拦着我，她早就败在我的剑下了，这你可要怎么赔我？¤If you hadn't stopped me just now, she would have been defeated by my sword, how are you going to compensate me for that?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}？！！你……¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}?! You ......
没想到她果然中计了，哈哈哈哈哈！¤I didn't think she'd fall for it, hahahahahaha!
慕容颖咬了咬牙，你隐约能看见她心中强行压下的怒火。¤Murong Ying gritted her teeth, and you could faintly see the anger she was forcing down in her heart.
哈哈哈哈，不愧是{FirstName}{xiongdi}，真是慧眼如炬！¤Hahahahahaha, worthy of {FirstName}{xiongdi}, what an eye!
虽然明面上以平局收场，但我们却谁都不服谁，就开始私下约着比试。¤Although it ended in an open draw, neither of us was convinced and we began to make private appointments for competitions.
你回头看向那名女修，想求证自己的判断是否正确。¤You look back at the woman, seeking to confirm whether you are correct.
第七年的时候，我在炼气巅峰还未突破，没想到她率先突破到了筑基期，比试的时候还丝毫没有留手！真是不讲武德！¤In my seventh year, I was at the peak of Qi refinement before I broke through, but I didn't expect her to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage first, and she didn't hold back at all during the competition! What a lack of martial virtue!
你不过会耍一些小聪明而已，若是……¤You're just going to be a little clever, if ......
那就让{FirstName}{xiongdi}来评评理好了，{FirstName}{xiongdi}的话你总不至于信不过吧？¤Let {FirstName}{xiongdi} be the judge of that, you can't trust {FirstName}{xiongdi}'s word, can you?
……我觉得慕容道友的剑更胜一筹。¤...... I think Daoist Muyong's sword is better.
后来，你又问起了这些年比试的故事。¤Later, you asked about the stories of the competitions over the years.
不过要我说，那场比赛要是继续下去肯定是我赢。¤But if I had to say, I would have won that game if it had gone ahead.
以多欺少可不是正道所为，道友，我来助你！¤It is not right to bully the few with the many, fellow Daoist, let me help you!
可惜这巨蟒修行未满，尚未结成{color=#d0380a}妖丹{/color}。否则这妖兽的妖丹，也是相当好的炼丹材料。¤It's unfortunate that the Boa's level of cultivation isn't high and has not yet formed a {color=#d0380a}beast core{/color}. Otherwise the beast core would have been quite good material for alchemy.
林子前方，只见一个年少俊朗剑修正与凶神恶煞的二人缠斗在一起。那剑修且战且退，二人则穷追不舍，步步紧逼。¤Ahead, you see a young swordsman engaging in a battle with two other men. He fights while retreating, but his opponents chase him relentlessly, getting closer and closer.
道友，偷听半天了，现在才想跑不觉得太晚了么？¤Fellow Daoist, you've been eavesdropping for half a day, don't you think it's too late to run away now?
那边的{xiongdi}！快救救我！只要救了我，我武陵城倪家必有重谢！¤Hey {xiongdi} over there! Quickly help me! If you save me, the Ni Family of Wuling City will be in your debt.
定睛观瞧，只见那剑修招招娴熟凌厉，闪转腾挪下，二人以夹击之势竟也一时难以近身。¤Looking closer, the Sword Cultivator is exceptionally skilled, every move is swift and fierce. He dodges every attack that comes his way, even when his opponents have him in a pincer attack, they could not get close to him.
双方见招拆招，有来有回，精彩异常，第一次亲眼看到修仙者斗法的你不禁感到大开眼界。¤Both sides throw attacks at their opponent, one attack after another, back and forth they go. It is beautiful, no,  superb, masterful even. This eye opening spectacle is how Cultivators fight.
有点意思，这小子的御剑之术倒是可圈可点，别看那二人气焰汹汹，不过只是徒有声势罢了，只可惜灵气难以为继，怕是双拳难敌四手.....¤Impressive, the kid's defensive sword technique is worthy of praise. Don't be fooled though, His strength is beginning to wane, alas a victory is difficult to imagine.
害，这大蟒蛇看着吓人，其实也不过如此。¤Hahaha, the Boa looks scary, but afterall that's all it had got.
你这{xiaozi}才修炼没几日，能过第一轮就已经算不错了。¤You {xiaozi} have only cultivated for a few days, and it's considered good if you can pass the first round.
这一轮的对手似乎是离火门的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be the cultivator from the Heavenly Fire Gate...
这一轮的对手似乎是化尘教的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be the cultivator of Huachen Cult...
这一轮的对手似乎是竹山宗的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be the cultivator of the Bamboo Mountain School...
恭喜{FirstName}{LastName}选手获得第二轮比试的胜利。¤Congratulations to {FirstName}{LastName} player for winning the second round of competition.
这一轮的对手似乎是倪家的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be the Ni family's cultivator...
这一轮的对手似乎是金虹剑派的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be a cultivator of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect...
咳咳咳...没想到第二轮就输了...¤Cough cough cough... I didn't expect to lose in the second round...
这一轮的对手似乎是林家的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be the cultivator of the Lin family...
这一轮的对手似乎是星河剑派的修士...¤The opponent in this round seems to be a cultivator from the Galaxy Sword Sect...
接下来马上开始第三轮的比试！¤Next, the third round of competition will begin immediately!
（邪魅地）就剩最后一点了，你那铁剑中的魂体也一并交出来吧。¤(Evilly) There is only one last point left, your soul body in the iron sword also handed out together.
要战便战罢。¤If you want to fight, then fight.
上次是我输了，但这次不会。¤I lost last time, but not this time.
让我见识见识你的实力吧。¤Let me see your strength.
如今除了这杀人炼魂的邪修，这附近也该恢复太平了吧。¤Except for this evil cultivator of killing people and refining souls, peace should be restored in this neighborhood.
我在倪旭荣的房间里发现了一张纸片。¤I found a piece of paper in Ni Xurong's room.
“老头儿，你是想起来什么了吗？”¤Old man, do you remember something?
找...到戮仙剑...被...放在...什么地方...？倪旭荣这小子难道对戮仙剑动了心思？¤Find... Found the Immortal Executing Sword... was... placed... where...? Is this kid Ni Xurong thought about Slaughter Fairy Sword?
哎，对，就是那玩意！你这不是知道吗？¤Hey, yes, that's the thing! Don't you know this?
只是觉得倪旭荣的房间过于整洁了......¤I just think Ni Xurong's room is too tidy...
{xiongdi}竟不知戮仙剑？九州有四把魔剑，其中戮仙剑存于白帝城，诛仙剑不知所踪。另外两把传闻落入了魔门手中，但不知此消息真假。¤{xiongdi} didn't know the Immortal Executing Sword? There are four demon swords in Kyushu. Among them, the Immortal Executing Sword is in Baidi City, and the Zhuxian Sword is missing. The other two rumors fell into the hands of the Demon Sect, but it is unknown whether this news is true or false.
诛仙剑阵。¤Zhu Xian Sword Array.
诶？这小子从哪抠的字粘了这么张纸？¤Huh? Where did this kid pick the words and paste such a piece of paper?
{xiongdi}怎么突然好奇起这个来了？¤{xiongdi} why is suddenly curious about this?
“还不是因为你这个哥哥不学无术...”¤It's not because your brother doesn't know how to learn...
戮仙剑？¤Immortal Executing Sword?
据说集齐四剑可组成...组成...组成什么来着？¤It is said that the collection of four swords can be composed...composition...what is the composition?
......诛仙剑阵？¤...Zhu Xian Sword Formation?
哈哈哈，那小子从小就这样一板一眼的，比老头子还像老头子！¤Hahaha, that kid has been so rigid since he was a child, he's more like an old man than an old man!
别问我，我只是觉得这个阵法名字很熟悉就脱口而出了。¤Don't ask me, I just blurted out because the name of this formation is familiar.
你弟真的住在这府里吗？¤Does your brother really live in this house?
稍远处传来神通轰击阵法的声音，走进一看，发现是炎萧，百里奇等人在尝试以力破阵。¤Slightly far away came the sound of magical power bombarding the formation, walked in and found that it was Yan Xiao, Bailiqi and others were trying to break the formation with force.
你观战了一会，发现炎萧等人不但没击破阵法核心，反倒受伤不轻。等他们退下来后，你走上去准备尝试一下。¤You watched the battle for a while, and found that Yan Xiao and the others not only failed to break through the core of the formation, but were seriously injured. After they retreat, you go up and prepare to try it.
击破一个傀儡后，你在附近发现了几个照顾伤者的修士，正是李青麟，慕容颖等人。¤After smashing a puppet, you found several cultivators taking care of the wounded nearby. It was Li Qinglin, Murongying and others.
观察许久后，你看破了此阵。走上前去，随意一挥手便是灵力澎湃而出轰击在核心薄弱部位，只听“咔嚓“一声，后者也是随之碎裂。¤After observing for a long time, you can see through this formation. Go forward and wave your hand at random to explode your spiritual power and bombard the weak part of the core. Only when you hear a click, the latter also shatters.
不同于门口聚灵阵的破败，这片药田弥漫浓郁的火灵气。¤Unlike the crumbling Spirit Gathering Formation at the entrance, this medicinal field is suffused with a rich fire spirit aura.
虽周围魔气涌动，但一株仙果傲立其中。¤Although the surrounding demonic energy surging, but an immortal fruit standing proudly among them.
事毕，你在此地搜寻了一番。在一间临时搭建的洞府内，你找到了一些功法秘籍。¤Afterwards, you searched the place. In a makeshift cave, you found some secret books of gong methods.
万魂殿的功法？若有空，研究一二倒也不错。¤Ten Thousand Souls Hall of Kung Fu? If you have time, it would be good to study one or two.
凭此万魂幡，应该就足以证明我替阴魂岛解决了玄冥海的祸端吧...¤With this Ten Thousand Souls Streamer, it should be enough to prove that I have solved the scourge of the Xuanmian Sea for the Yin Soul Island...
此处乃是一片废墟，已经难以辨认是什么地方了。¤This place is a ruin, it is already difficult to identify what is the place.
哈哈，你有年头没回逸风城看过了吧。新的宁王早就上任了，我们逸风城的散修总算不用过那种人心惶惶的日子了！¤Haha, you haven't been back to Yifeng City to see it in years. The new Ning King has taken office a long time ago, and our independent cultivators in Yifeng City finally don't have to live the panic days!
兄台留步，这宁王可是回来任职了？¤Xiongtai stays, but is Wang Ning coming back to take up his post?
听说韩前辈几千年前修炼到元婴期，靠的是一本叫《长春功》的功法，可惜现在已经失传了。¤I heard that Senior Han cultivated to the Nascent Soul realm thousands of years ago, relying on a practice called the Eternal Spring Mantra, but unfortunately it has now been lost.
等你挑选完自己的主修功法，{color=#d0380a}再回来找我{/color}。¤When you finish choosing your major practice, {color=#d0380a} come back and find me{/color}.
不过到时候，师姐我可就是你的对手了。¤But then, Senior Sister, I will be your opponent.
{shidi}，还没去领取入门功法么？¤{shidi}, haven't you gone to receive the introductory exercise?
{shidi}，还有什么事么？¤{shidi}, is there anything else?
{shidi}，还没去神兵阁么？¤{shidi}, haven't you gone to the Shenbing Pavilion?
不错，看来你已经领好外门弟子的衣物了。¤Yes, it seems that you have already picked up the outer disciple's clothes.
你在门派内的居所刚刚我已经派人打扫干净，宗门内的大部分地方你都可以随意走动。¤Your residence in the sect has just been cleaned up by someone. You can walk around in most places in the sect.
我派外门弟子也可以学习门派的一些基础功法和法术，藏经阁执事会根据师妹的修炼水平提供适合你修习的功法。¤My disciples from the outer sect can also learn some basic exercises and spells of the sect. The deacon of the Tibetan Scripture Pavilion will provide you with the exercises suitable for your practice according to the level of the junior sect.
听说上一届天机阁的拍卖会上，有人出了好几千万灵石，拍到了一件通天灵宝级别的宝物，要是有机会能去开开眼界就好了。¤I heard that at the last Heavens Secrets Pavilion auction, someone sold tens of millions of spirit stones and photographed a treasure of the Heavenly Spirit Treasure level. It would be nice if I had the opportunity to open my eyes.
寒暄几句后，你推托不愿叨扰岛主修养，便离开了圣地。¤After a few words of greeting, you left the holy land without disturbing the island master's cultivation.
再次见到岛主时，他依旧端坐在内殿的交椅上，面容看起来清减了许多，眉目间那股阴邪之气也消散了。¤When I saw the island owner again, he was still sitting on the top seat in the inner hall, his face looked much clearer, and the evil spirit between his eyebrows disappeared.
多谢小友救人水火，如果你愿意，千流岛的供奉之位依旧为你保留。¤Thank you, my little friend, for saving people's lives. If you want, the position of guest elder of Qianliu Island is still reserved for you.
那魔修所种植的万象花日前我已派人铲除，先前的供奉也都分发了丹药及补偿。我连家依旧会广纳贤士，相信假以时日，无尽之海上传播的便不会再是千流岛的凶名。¤The Vientiane flower planted by the evil cultivator has been wiped out a few days ago, and Pills and compensation have been distributed to the previous guest elders. My family will still be recruiting and welcoming outsiders. I believe that in time, the endless sea will not be spreading the evil name of Qianliu Island again.
不知岛主接下来有什么打算...？¤I don't know what plans the owner has next...?
你收下功法，思及那些受到控制的无辜散修，不由对千流岛后续如何解决这些棘手的问题感到几分疑惑。¤You accept the technique and think about the innocent independent cultivators who are under control. You can't help but feel a little bit puzzled about how Qianlidao will solve these difficult problems in the future.
那{FirstName}某便祝千流岛早日恢复正轨。¤Then {FirstName} would like to wish Qianliu Island back on track as soon as possible.
除此之外，承蒙小友大恩，这是我千流岛连家真正的传承功法。¤In addition, thanks to the great kindness of my little friends, this is the real inheritance technique of my Qianliu Island Lian Family.
炼器租借，一次200灵石。{w}{w=0.5}¤Refining equipment rental, 200 spirit stones at a time. {w}{w=0.5}
你啧啧称奇，一边开始调查石棺内部。偌大的石棺竟是空荡荡的，只是在中间摆放着一片巨大的黑色鳞片。¤You are amazed, and you start to investigate the inside of the sarcophagus. The huge sarcophagus was actually empty, but there was a huge black scale in the middle.
先收着吧，没准那些{color=#d0380a}采筠阁{/color}的修士会对它感兴趣呢。¤Keep it for now, maybe those cultivators in the {color=#d0380a}Caijun Pavilion{/color} will be interested in it.
你放出神识扫过，岩壁中心果然留有一个不小的空腔。你顺势找到了一个隐蔽的洞口，一路来到了洞窟的中心，只见一个足有数十丈宽的巨大石棺被摆放在其中，饶是你见多是广，也不由得感到惊讶。¤You let out your soul sense and swept over, and there was indeed a large cavity in the center of the rock wall. You found a hidden entrance and came all the way to the center of the cave. You saw a huge sarcophagus with a width of dozens of feet placed in it. You can't help but be surprised.
这些古代人类大费周章打造了这具石棺，将它运到这么高的峭壁上，想必这鳞片必定大有来头。¤These ancient humans took great pains to build this sarcophagus and transport it to such a high cliff, presumably the scales must have a great background.
好大的石棺，这一定不是为普通人类打造的，真是稀奇。¤Such a large sarcophagus, it must not be made for ordinary humans, it is really strange.
看样子这里应该是某个古代工程的遗迹。如果我没猜错的话，外围的木桩不过是临时搭建的支点或者栈道，而这岩壁中心必定还内有乾坤。若是用神识探查一番，没准就能有所发现。¤It seems that this should be the remains of an ancient project. If I guessed correctly, the wooden piles on the periphery are just temporary fulcrums or plank roads, and there must be a universe in the center of this rock wall. If you use your spiritual sense to investigate, you may be able to find something.
这木桩不似自然形成，那必定是人为搭建的。顺着这个想法，你在四处仔细观察了一番，果然又发现了不少类似的木桩。只是因为时间久远，大部分都已经腐朽破败了。¤The stake does not appear to be formed naturally, it must be man-made. Following this idea, you looked around carefully, and sure enough, you found a lot of similar wooden stakes. Just because of the long time, most of them have been rotten and dilapidated.
嗯...这是什么妖兽身上的鳞片？看着和吞云蟒的鳞片有几分相似，但又不完全一样。¤Hmm... What kind of scales are these monsters? It looks somewhat similar to the scales of the Cloud Swallowing Python, but it is not exactly the same.
这座岛上群峦叠嶂，你飞过一处岩壁，只见一根巨大的木桩突兀地插在岩缝之中，周围却空无一物。¤This island is surrounded by mountains and mountains. You fly over a rock wall, and you see a huge wooden stake inserted into the rock crevice abruptly, but there is nothing around it.
师伯你听，连{FirstName}{xiongdi}都这么说了！¤Listen, Master, even {FirstName}{xiongdi} says so!
嗯？{FirstName}{xiongdi}来了！快帮我劝劝师伯，换别的长老来镇守白帝楼吧！¤Hmm? {FirstName}{xiongdi}is here! Quickly help me persuade senior to change to another elder to guard the White Emperor's House!
师祖，你就让我和你一起去吧。我现在也突破化神了，肯定不会给你惹麻烦的！¤Master, just let me go with you. Now that I've also broken through the Deity Transformation, I'm sure I won't cause you any trouble!
好了{shidi}，随我来吧。¤All right {shidi}, follow me.
你眼睛看向别处，装作没听到他叫你的样子。¤You look away with your eyes and pretend you didn't hear him call you.
你刚一走进白帝楼，便听到倪旭欣在大声嚷嚷着什么。¤As soon as you walk into Whitty House, you hear Ni XuXin yelling something.
倪旭欣看起来很失落。¤Ni XuXin looks lost.
此番玄道宗的混元子道友受我所邀为我飞升护法。我和他都不在，若是无人坐镇白帝楼，难免会重蹈上次玄道宗的覆辙。¤This time, fellow Daoist Mixer of the Mystic Dao Sect has been invited by me to guard my ascension. With him and I both away, if there is no one to sit at the White Emperor's House, it is inevitable that the same mistake will be made as the one made by the Mystic Dao Sect last time.
师祖，你就让我和你一起去吧，我早就想看看渡劫是什么样的了！¤Master, let me go with you, I've long wanted to see what it's like to go through a tribulation!
白帝的声音突然一反常态的严肃起来。¤The White Emperor's voice was suddenly uncharacteristically serious.
此番我渡劫无论成功与否，白帝楼都要交到你们这些后辈的手上。若你还如此不识大体，让我如何放心的下？¤Whether I succeed or fail in my tribulation, the White Emperor's House will be in the hands of your juniors. If you are still so insensitive, how can I feel at ease?
{FirstName}{xiongdi}你...¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}You...
我...我知道了...¤I... I got it...
师兄便让他去吧，有其他白帝楼和玄道宗的长老留着，应该不会出什么纰漏的。¤Let him go, Brother. With the other elders from the White Emperor's House and the Mystic Dao Sect staying behind, nothing should go wrong.
{FirstName}供奉，我是碎星商会的管事{$name}，有什么需要我帮助的？{w}{w=0.5}¤Guest elder {FirstName}, I am the Steward of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild {$name}, what can I do to help? {w}{w=0.5}
他们祖传的炼体法门强悍无比，甚至能与一般的海兽正面抗衡而不落下风。¤Their ancestral body refining methods are extremely powerful, and they can even compete head-on with ordinary sea beasts without losing the wind.
因此，每隔十年在南崖城举办的拍卖会，可以说是无尽之海上的一大盛事。¤Therefore, the auction held in Nanya City every ten years can be said to be a major event in the endless sea.
可惜...不知为何他们一族得罪了龙族。这龙族势力强大，即便是商会也不愿与他们起冲突。¤It's a pity... I don't know why their clan offended the dragon clan. This dragon clan is so powerful that even the Merchant Guild is unwilling to conflict with them.
千余年前，百里家的确也是岛上的一大家族，实力甚至并不逊色于现在的三大家族。¤More than a thousand years ago, the Baili family was indeed a large family on the island, and its strength was not even inferior to the three current families.
不仅仅只是收集海上的宝物，我们还与中州，宁州的{color=#d0380a}天机阁{/color}，雍州，衡州的{color=#d0380a}广源商盟{/color}都有贸易往来，见过的奇珍异宝可谓数不胜数。¤Not only collecting treasures from the sea, we are also in cooperation with {color=#d0380a}Heavens Secrets Pavilion{/color} in Zhongzhou, Ning Province, {color=#d0380a}Guangyuan Merchant League{/color} in Yongzhou and Hengzhou. There are trades and there are countless rare treasures I have seen.
噢，你是从何听起他们的？¤Oh, how did you hear of them?
我们商会由碎星岛上的三大家族共同管理，商会的总部就设在南崖城，可以说是遍布于整片无尽之海上最大的商会组织。¤Our Merchant Guild is jointly managed by three families on Broken Star Island. The headquarters of the Merchant Guild is located in Nanya City. It can be said that it is the largest Merchant Guild organization spread across the entire endless sea.
总之，因为这件事，百里全族一起迁离了碎星岛，也不知现在情况如何...¤In short, because of this incident, the whole family of Baili moved out of Broken Star Island together, and I don't know what the situation is now...
当然，我们商会愿意用高价收购那些稀有的草药和材料，让我看看你有些什么吧。¤Of course, our Merchant Guild is willing to purchase those rare herbs and materials at high prices. Let me see what you have.
我指的自然是唐家，白家和吴家。¤I mean the Tang family, the Bai family and the Wu family.
至于唐家与吴家，也是传承已久的古老家族，你在拍卖会上能买到的法宝与丹药大多出自他们两家之手。¤As for the Tang family and the Wu family, they are also ancient families that have been passed down for a long time. Most of the magic weapons and Pills you can buy at auctions came from their two families.
道友，我是碎星商会的管事{$name}，有什么需要我帮助的？{w}{w=0.5}¤Fellow Daoist, I am the Steward of the Shattered Star Merchant Guild {$name}, what can I do to help? {w}{w=0.5}
我们商会里用的灵舟，大多是由白家炼制，远比寻常修士使用的灵舟要坚固许多。¤The spirit boats used in our Merchant Guild are mostly refined by the Bai family, and are much stronger than those used by ordinary cultivators.
因此，我们的船才敢开进那些密布灵气乱流的海域。¤Therefore, our ship dared to drive into those seas with turbulent auras.
竟是化尘教的{FirstName}长老么？我常听别人提及你的名号，当真是年轻有为！¤It's actually the elder of {FirstName} of the Huachen Cult? I often hear your name mentioned by others, so I am really young and promising!
这柄飞剑虽有纯阳法宝威能，但只有通过剑阵加持方可发挥。{$TmpTalkString}若有机会寻得此剑，还请交换给我派，我们必有重谢！¤Although this flying sword has the power of a pure Yang magic treasure, it can only be used with the help of a sword formation. {If you have the chance to find this sword, please exchange it for our school.
若能找回灵剑，便可重启剑阵护佑我派...唉。¤If you can find the magic sword, you can restart the sword formation to protect me... alas.
竟是离火门的{FirstName}长老么？我常听别人提及你的名号，当真是年轻有为！¤It was the elder {FirstName} from Heavenly Fire Gate? I often hear your name mentioned by others. I really am young and promising!
当年星河剑阵的威力也算名震宁州，熟料五阵眼之一的仙剑竟会遗失在这古迹中。¤The power of the Galaxy Sword Formation back then was also known as ShaNing King Province, and the fairy sword, one of the five eyes of the clinker, would have been lost in this historic site.
玄伶还有一事想要拜托{$TmpTalkString}。¤Xuan Ling has one more thing she would like to ask {$TmpTalkString}.
道友此番前往宁州古迹，切多加小心。¤Friends of the Taoist priest are going to the historic sites in Ning Province, please be careful.
原来是玄伶长老。许久未见，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤So it is Elder Xuan Ling. I haven't seen you for a long time, so if we meet in the monuments this time, please take care of us.
听说这次有不少其它州的修士也想进入古迹寻宝，我们这些宁州同道自然应该互相扶持。¤I heard that many cultivators from other prefectures also wanted to enter the ancient treasure hunt this time. Naturally, we Ning Province colleagues should support each other.
竟是竹山宗的{FirstName}长老么？我常听别人提及你的名号，当真是年轻有为！¤It's actually the elder of {FirstName} of Bamboo Mountain School? I often hear your name mentioned by others. I really am young and promising!
原来是星河剑派的玄伶长老，久仰大名，此番若是在古迹中相遇，还请多多照应。¤It turned out to be the elder Xuan Ling of the Galaxy Sword Sect. He has long admired his name. If you meet in a historic site, please take care of it.
竟是金虹剑派的{FirstName}长老么？我常听明河长老提及你的名号，当真是年轻有为！¤Ah, you must be Elder {FirstName} of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect! I often hear Elder Radiant River mention your name, truly a new rising star!
我派曾经倾全派资源炼制过一套剑阵，共由五柄纯阳法宝级别的仙剑组成，威能不俗。¤My faction has used all our resources to refine a set of sword formation. It consists of five pure yang magic weapon tier swords. It is powerful.
除了他们，还有数人受你所邀。遁光道道，他们从四面八方陆续赶来，在离你稍近的地方观礼。¤In addition to them, there are several others who have been invited by you. They come one after another from all directions to watch the ceremony from a place a little closer to you.
除了他们，就只剩你一人在这风暴的中心，独自对抗天降的雷劫。¤Apart from them, you are left alone in the heart of this storm, fighting alone against the thunderbolts descending from the sky.
以你为中心，附近所有的修士都被天地异象所吸引。他们不敢靠近，只能远远的围观。¤With you at the centre, all the cultivators in the vicinity are attracted by the vision of heaven and earth. They dare not approach and can only watch from afar.
除了他们，还有百余人受你所邀。遁光道道，他们从四面八方陆续赶来，在离你稍近的地方观礼。¤Besides them, there are more than a hundred others who have been invited by you. They came one by one from all directions to watch the ceremony a little closer to you.

除了他们，还有数十人受你所邀。遁光道道，他们从四面八方陆续赶来，在离你稍近的地方观礼。¤Besides them, dozens of others have been invited by you. They came one by one from all directions, in a trail of transported light, to watch the ceremony from a place slightly closer to you.
除了他们，还有十余人受你所邀。遁光道道，他们从四面八方陆续赶来，在离你稍近的地方观礼。¤Besides them, there are more than ten others who have been invited by you. They came one by one from all directions to watch the ceremony a little closer to you.
多亏了客栈老板通知我，此番才能及时赶到。这是你的奖励。¤Thanks to the innkeeper for informing me, I can arrive in time. This is your reward.
知道就好，我们不会放过你的！¤Just know, we won't let you go!
你是自己伏法还是要吃点苦头？¤Are you going to do it yourself or do you have to suffer?
呵呵，你先担心自己吧。\n¤Oh, you worry about yourself first. \n
神教？（老头，你知道他在说什么嘛？）¤The Ancient God's Cult? (Old man, do you know what he's talking about?)
抓我？你还不够格...¤Catch me? You are not qualified...
刚刚冲出客栈的李天便被一道剑光击落，迅速有人现身，将其制服。¤Li Tian, who had just rushed out of the inn, was struck down by a sword light, and someone quickly showed up to subdue him.
我加入神教，受了这么多折磨，吃了这么多苦，就这么败了！！？¤I joined the Ancient God's Cult and suffered so much torture yet you still defeated me?!
血遁术，嗨，这些宵小之辈也就这点手段了。¤Blood Escape, hey, this is what the younger generations can do.
神教？又是古神教？¤The Ancient God's Cult? Is it them again?
多谢前辈相救。¤Thank you senior for helping me.
白帝楼？？！！¤Bai Di Lou??!!!
怎么会？¤How!? How did you beat me?!
莫要怪我，我也是奉命行事，受死吧。¤Don't blame me, I also acted on orders, die.
呵呵，你先担心自己吧。¤Hehe, worry about yourself first.
这白帝楼做事倒是滴水不漏，这周围已有人部下剑阵，{xiaozi}多学学啊。¤This Baidi Building does not leak water, there are already people around here, {xiaozi} learn more.
我古神教乃是衡州第一大教，你坏我好事，我们不会放过你的！¤My Ancient God's Cult is the number one religion in Ning Province!! If you spoil my plans, we will not let you off!!!!
我手头还有要事处理，此事你自行回白帝楼找当值执事汇报吧。¤I have important matters at hand, so go back to the White Emperor's House and report to the Deacon on duty.
奉命?哪家的啊？¤Ordered? Which one?
小友，这次你有些冒失了，这厮已经加入古神教，颇有几分神通。¤Little friend, you are a little rash this time. This fellow has already joined the ancient gods and has some magical powers.
只见李天面色痛苦，但周身泛起血雾，向远处疾驰而去。¤I only saw Li Tian's face in pain, but his body was flooded with blood mist as he sped off into the distance.
玄伶长老似乎与那金虹剑派的明河长老关系密切，是我多心了么......？¤Elder Starsong seems to have a close relationship with the Elder Radiant River of the Golden Rainbow Sword Sect. Am I thinking too much of it...?
此番前来宁州古迹，我定要替宗门找回那柄遗失的仙剑！¤I'm coming to Ning Province Historic Sites this time, I will definitely find the lost fairy sword for Zongmen!
此次前往宁州古迹需要打点的事情颇多，我便不陪道友多聊了。¤There are a lot of things to take care of when visiting the historic sites in Ning Province, so I won't talk more with the fellow daoists.
小胖子，老老实实的把值钱的东西都交出来。¤Little fatty, hand over everything of value honestly.
（低头看看自己）我胖吗？也没有吧。¤(looks down at himself) Am I fat? Not really.
有这等手段，却还要钓鱼上钩，这位也是....我们也走吧。¤With such tactics and yet you have to fish for the bait, this one is also .... Let's go too.
喂，这才刚出城你们几个就等不及了？这还没出星宫地界呢。¤Hey, we've only just left the city and you guys can't wait? We haven't even left the boundary of the Star Palace yet.
（捡起对方的法宝和储物袋掂了掂）霍~还挺有钱。走了啊。¤(Picking up the other person's magic treasure and storage bag and weighing it) Huo~ quite rich. Let's go.
此人多半是发现了我们吧。¤This person has most probably found us out.
看来，是要爷爷我自己动手了。¤It seems that it's up to Grandpa and me to do it myself.
说罢一团火焰激射而出，直奔对方几人。他们连反应都没有就直接灰飞烟灭了。¤With that a ball of flame shot out and headed straight for several people on the other side. They didn't even have to react before they were directly extinguished in smoke.
（上下掂量）不错，捡到根不错的柴火。¤(weighing up and down) Nice, I found a nice piece of firewood.
栖云违背祖训家规，已被家主剥夺了长老的身份，禁闭于府内。希望他能好好悔过，日后能够戴罪立功。¤Qiyun violated the family rules of the ancestors and has been deprived of his status as an elder by the head of the family. He is confined in the mansion. I hope that he will repent well and be able to take his sins and make meritorious deeds in the future.
星宫以双修之术闻名，千年前星辰尊者与广微仙子便是通过这些秘术双双突破到了化神期。¤Star Palace is famous for its double cultivation technique. Thousands of years ago, Venerable Star and Fairy Guangwei both broke through to the stage of Deity Transformation through these secret techniques.
家主对沐心期望颇高，又怎么会便宜了冲虚那个老鬼。¤The Patriarch has high expectations for Mu Xin, how could it be cheaper, that old ghost Chongxu.
是{FirstName}小友啊，来找我有什么事？{w}{w=0.5}¤It's {FirstName}, what can I do if you come to see me? {w}{w=0.5}
这冲虚修为在金丹期停滞多年，便想效仿前人，也打上了我们林家女眷的主意。¤This Chongxu cultivation base has been stagnant for many years in the Golden Core Phase, so I wanted to follow the example of the predecessors, and it was also marked by the idea of ​​our Lin family.
邪修？具体是何境界？¤The Dragon Clan is the dominant power on the sea and has one of the Four Great Demon Saints, the Great Sage of the Sea, sitting in its place. If you don't tell me the truth, I can't say yes. Evil cultivator? What realm is it?
{color=#d0380a}玄冥海{/color}近年有人类邪修布阵猎杀魂体，前辈可愿前去根除此事？¤{color=#d0380a}Deep Black Sea {/color}has in recent years had evil human cultivators setting up arrays to hunt souls, would you like to go and resolve this?
只见一名手握神阴石、阴体极为凝实的魂体老者，正在闭目修炼。¤I only saw an old man with a divine Yin stone in his hand and an extremely solid Yin body, who was cultivating with his eyes closed.
确有一事需道友出手。¤There is indeed a matter that needs your help.
他正在闭目修炼，对往来的事物都毫不关心。¤He was cultivating with his eyes closed, unconcerned with anything that came or went.
多谢指点，在下定会全力以赴。¤Thanks for pointing out, I will definitely do my best.
本座对此事没有兴趣。¤This seat has no interest in this matter.
抱歉，未能完成你们的任务。¤Sorry for not being able to complete your task.
……还是不要影响他修炼了。¤It ...... is better not to affect his cultivation.
既然如此，此事还是我等自行解决罢，劳烦前辈费心了。¤In that case, it is better for us to settle this matter ourselves, and to trouble the seniors with it.
在下{FirstName}{LastName}，为逆天造化术而来，道友可愿指点一二？¤I {FirstName}{LastName}, came for {color=#d0380a}reverse heaven creation technique, would you like to guide me?
{color=#d0380a}玄冥海{/color}近年有人类邪修布阵猎杀魂体，道友可愿前去根除此事？¤The {color=#d0380a}Earthly Sea{/color} has had human evil cultivators hunting for souls in recent years, would you like to go and eradicate this?
凭借此物，应该足以证明我完成了任务吧？¤With this object, it should be enough to prove that I have completed my mission, right?
前辈既已得到逆天造化术，这五块神阴石便归前辈所有了。¤Since senior has already obtained the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique, these five Divine Yin Stones will belong to senior.
你将万魂幡拿了出来。¤You took out the Ten Thousand Souls Streamer.
前辈只需将此事告知岛主李司魂，便可获得逆天造化术。¤All senior needs to do is to inform the island master, Li Si Ling, of this matter and he will be able to obtain the Reverse Creation Technique.
前辈果然神通广大。¤The seniors are truly magical.
{$xiaoyou}只需将此事告知岛主李司魂，便可领取逆天造化术。¤{$xiaoyou}Only need to inform the island master, Li Si Soul, about this matter, and then you can receive the Reverse Heaven Creation Technique.
知道了。¤Got it.
他的表情没有丝毫变化，至始至终都在闭目修炼。¤His expression did not change in the slightest, and he was cultivating with his eyes closed from the beginning to the end.
传言其首领至少有元婴后期修为。¤It is rumored that the leader has at least a late stage YuanYing cultivation.
邪修？具体是什么境界？¤Evil cultivator? Exactly what realm is it?
不错¤Not bad.
道友便是无尘了？¤So you're Dustless?
正是，敢问前辈有何指教？¤Exactly, what can I tell you?
{$xiaoyou}既已得到逆天造化术，这五块神阴石便归{$xiaoyou}所有了。¤{The five divine Yin stones will be owned by {$xiaoyou} since they have already obtained the Heavenly Creation Technique.
叨饶了，请问道友便是无尘么？¤I'm sorry, but are you the one who has no dust?
凭借此物，应该足以证明一切了吧？¤With this object, it should be enough to prove everything, right?
这里的气息...是那只元婴期的金鹏大妖！¤The aura here... It's that great golden roc demon of the YuanYing stage!
啊，既然此间事已了，我也该回星宫复命了，有缘再见啦。¤Ah, now that this matter is over, I should return to the Star Palace to return to my life. Goodbye by fate.
星铃儿说完便是驭法宝破空离去，只留你在原地发愣。¤After Xing Ling'er finished speaking, the magic weapon broke away, leaving you in a daze.
传音符...我一般都不用那个的诶，总觉得随时能被找到不太自由。嗯，就当我欠你个人情啦，我们还是有缘再见吧，嘻嘻。¤Sound transmission... I usually don't use that one, I always feel that it's not very free to be found at any time. Well, just treat me as I owe you a favor. Let's meet again by fate, hee hee.
多谢帮忙，不然要我一个人全部解决还挺麻烦的呢。¤Thank you for your help, otherwise it would be quite troublesome for me to solve it all by myself.
侥幸而已，¤It was just a fluke.
嗯..总还是能让宁州再安宁一些吧。¤Hmm.. It's always better to make Ning Province more peaceful.
请稍等，星姑娘可愿与我互在传音符中留下神识印记，留作联系用？¤Please wait a moment, Miss Xing is willing to leave a mark of divine consciousness in the sound transmission with me, and keep it for contact?
嘻嘻，宁州的同辈最强的应该就是道友你啦！¤Hehehe, the strongest peer of Ning Province should be you!
没想到你居然这么强，连栖云长老也不是你的对手！¤I didn't expect you to be so strong, even Elder Quyun is no match for you!
星姑娘不用客气，我作为宁州正道修仙者，也有责任除魔卫道。¤You're welcome, Miss Xing, as a cultivator of the righteous path in Ning Province, I also have the responsibility to eliminate demons and guard the path.
哈哈哈，不过到时候，师兄我可就是你的对手了。¤Hahaha, but then, brother, I will be your opponent.
另外，门派每三十年会举办一次{color=#d0380a}宗门大比{/color}，夺魁者不仅可以直接成为内门弟子，拜入我派任一一位长老门下修习，还能获得一枚筑基丹作为奖励。¤In addition, the sect holds a {color=#d0380a}Grand Sect Competition{/color} every thirty years. The winner can not only directly become an inner disciple, but also study under any one of our elders. They will also recieve a Foundation Pill as a reward.
我派外门弟子也可以学习门派的一些基础功法和法术，外门的传功长老一般都会在宗门广场，你可以先去挑选一本适合你的基础功法来修炼。¤My disciples from the outer sect can also learn some basic exercises and spells of the sect. The elders of the outer sect will usually be in Zongmen Square. You can first choose a basic exercise that suits you to practice.
火系功法在五行法术中最为刚猛，一旦施展开来，便是不死不休，连绵不绝的攻势。¤The fire system is the most violent among the five element spells. Once it is deployed, it will be an endless and endless offensive.
年轻人就该多去天魔眼中历练历练，好过一天天在宗门内埋头苦修。¤Young people should go to the eyes of the demon to experience more experience, rather than burying their heads in the sect every day.
解决掉这批劫匪后，你回头望去，却不见了那姑娘的踪迹。四下搜索无果的你，只能继续上路...¤After you dealt with these robbers, you looked back, but no trace of the girl. You who searched around to no avail, can only continue on the road...
你实力不足自身难保，也再顾不得什么英雄救美，头也不回地逃走了...¤You are not strong enough to protect yourself, and you can no longer care about any heroes to save the United States, and you ran away without looking back...
一圈圈涟漪从光幕中心扩散开来，但光幕看起来仍然十分稳固。¤Circles of ripples spread from the center of the light curtain, but the light curtain still looks very stable.
玄古门？¤Profound Ancient Sect?
血菩提！？这等天才地宝离火门每年流出的也不多吧。¤Blood Bodhi! Not many of these genius treasures flow out of the Heavenly Fire Gate every year, right?
可不是？\n¤But no? \n
嗯~我这次凑了不少灵石，再看看能不能再买一枚。¤Hmm~ I've scraped together quite a few spirit stones this time, so I'll see if I can buy another one.
又是玄古门的人啊。¤It's the Profound Ancient Sect again.
道友最近刚刚出关吧。这玄古门的人10年前出现在坊市，出售了几枚血菩提。¤Fellow Daoist has just recently come out of seclusion, right? This person from the Profound Ancient Clan appeared in the market 10 years ago and sold a few blood bodhi.
这天星城最近倒是风云际会，平日里难得一遇的血菩提和延寿丹药，最近倒是见了很多。¤This Heavenly Star City has been quite a stormy place lately. Blood Bodhi and life extension pills, which are normally rare, have been seen a lot lately.
前方的一个摊位上聚集了一群人。¤A crowd of people has gathered at a stall in front of it.
你收敛气息，快速找了一个隐秘之处躲藏起来。不多时，便有一道白色的遁光从洞口闪过。¤You restrained your breath and quickly found a hidden place to hide. After a while, a white light flashed from the entrance of the cave.
这遁术并不算常见，按你的印象，此人当是来自千流岛的修士。他们功法诡异，出手果决狠辣，非常不好对付。你决定...？¤This escape technique is not very common. According to your impression, this person is a cultivator from Qianliu Island. Their techniques are weird, and they are very hard to deal with. You decide...?
你收敛气息，慢慢走进洞窟...还未等你摘下草药，突然一道劲风从背后袭来。¤You restrained your breath and walked slowly into the cave... Before you took off the herbs, suddenly a strong wind came from behind.
你虽多少有些防备，勉力避开了要害。但此人攻势凌厉，你未曾来得及运转灵气便受此创伤，已然落入下风！¤Although you are somewhat defensive, you managed to avoid the key points. But this person is on the offensive. You were traumatized by this before you had time to run Reiki, and you have fallen into a disadvantage!
这样遁术并不常见，你虽不清除此人底细，但他的修为应当不弱。你决定...？¤This kind of escape technique is not common. Although you don't clear the details of this person, his cultivation level should not be weak. You decide...?
你刚出洞窟，正准备带着草药扬长而去，一道白色的遁光就已闪到你的面前。¤You just came out of the cave, and you were about to take the herbs and leave, and a white light flashed in front of you.
没想到此人行事如此果决，一言未发出手便是杀招。你大惊失色，虽勉力避开要害，但仍然受了一些轻伤。¤I didn't expect this person to act so decisively, and without a word, it would be a killer move. You were shocked. Although you tried to avoid the vital points, you still suffered some minor injuries.
不过你也是学艺不精，不过一{SayStcVal=929}，竟险些致你于死地。¤You're an amatuer, almost get killed by Just a {SayStcVal=929}.
哼，这妖兽真是不长眼竟敢袭击本门弟子。¤Hmph, this monster must have no brain. How could it dared to attack our sect's disciples!
多谢长老救命之恩。¤Thank you elders for your life-saving grace.
长老教训的是。¤What the elder taught.
白帝正端坐在空地正中运功调息，见你走来，他微睁双眼，向你点点头。¤The White Emperor is sitting in the middle of the clearing, toning up his energy. When he sees you approaching, he opens his eyes slightly and nods to you.
{shidi}可有打过招呼了？¤Did {shidi} say hello?
哦？星宫那位宫主虽然性格乖僻令我难以理解，但不至于食言才是，应当是有自己的考量吧。¤Oh? Although the master of the Star Palace has a peculiar personality that I find difficult to understand, he is not likely to go back on his word, so he must have his own considerations.
只是...星凝似乎还没有来。¤It's just that... Starling doesn't seem to be here yet.
还是麻烦{shidi}代我跟他们打个招呼吧。¤I'd better ask {shidi} to say hello to them for me.
无尽之海危险重重，若是没有同行修士结伴，又没有情报来源，普通散修去远海猎杀海兽无异于自寻死路。¤The endless sea is full of dangers. If there is no companion of fellow Daoists and no source of intelligence, ordinary independent cultivators going to the distant sea to hunt sea beasts is tantamount to seeking a dead end.
（惊恐地看着你）你...你想做什么？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you in horror) You... what do you want to do? {w}{w=0.5}
我和你没有什么可交易的。¤I have nothing to trade with you.
（煞气腾腾地看着你）噢？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Looking at you fiercely) Oh? {w}{w=0.5}
我这里没有其它值得一提的传闻了...¤I don't have any other rumours worth mentioning here...
看你的样子，应该是第一次出海吧。¤Looking at you, it should be the first time to go to sea.
这附近的海域似乎聚集了不少的海兽，前不久，我们才发现了一只{$name}的踪迹。¤There seems to be a lot of sea beasts gathered in the sea near here. Not long ago, we found a trace of {$name}.
我们蓬莎岛其实就是因此而成立的一个散修同盟，我们在那里交易物资与情报，组队同行，久而久之也成为了这片无尽之海中数一数二的势力。¤Our Pongsha Island is actually a independent cultivator alliance formed because of this. We trade materials and intelligence there, form a team, and become one of the best forces in this endless sea over time.
如果你想赚上一笔，就去碎星岛或者南崖城找找我们商会的负责人吧。¤If you want to make a fortune, go to Broken Star Island or Nanya City to find the person in charge of our Merchant Guild.
你想做什么？敢对我们蓬莎岛的人动手？¤What do you want to do? Dare to do something to our people on Pongsha Island?
这附近并没有发生什么特殊的事。¤Nothing special happened around here.
最近似乎没有什么值得一提的传闻，道友有什么想知道的，不妨去蓬沙岛的{color=#d0380a}采筠阁{/color}打听一番。¤There doesn't seem to be any rumors worth mentioning recently. If you have anything you want to know, you might as well go to {color=#d0380a}Caijun Pavilion{/color} on Pongsha Island.
（提防地看着你）我听说过你的名字，你想做什么？{w}{w=0.5}¤(Watching you watchfully) I heard your name, what do you want to do? {w}{w=0.5}
前不久，我们在这附近发现了一只{$name}的踪迹。除此以外，似乎还没有发生什么特殊的事。¤Not long ago, we found a trace of {$name} near here. Other than that, nothing special seems to have happened.
西北角那边似有一方小岛上浮，疑似是上古龙宫的残骸。有一龙族直奔而去。¤There seems to be a small island floating on the northwest corner, which is suspected to be the wreckage of the Ancient Dragon Palace. A dragon race went straight.
何人胆敢擅闯本座洞府！¤Who would dare to break into this cave mansion!
还未等你动手，突然周天灵气翻涌，原本已经损坏的阵法又重新运转起来！¤Before you do it, suddenly Zhou Tian's spiritual energy surges, and the originally damaged formation is running again!
丹房外布有一些简单的禁制，但更多应是为了隔热与预防炸炉，不难破解。可惜的是，你什么有用的东西也没有找到。¤There are some simple restrictions on the outside cloth of the Danfang, but more should be for heat insulation and prevention of the fryer. It is not difficult to crack. Unfortunately, you have not found anything useful.
无需多言，今日你我之间必有一死！¤Needless to say, there must be death between you and me today!
丹房外布有一些简单的禁制，但更多应是为了隔热与预防炸炉，不难破解。你在这里找到了几颗刚刚炼制成功的丹药。¤There are some simple prohibitions on the outside of the pill room, but more should be for heat insulation and prevention of the fryer. It is not difficult to crack. Here you have found a few medicinal pills that have just been refined.
{FirstName}{LastName}，竟然是你？¤{FirstName}{LastName}, it turned out to be you?
洞府的主人还没有回来，你决定...？{w}{w=0.5}¤The master of the cave has not come back, you decide...? {w}{w=0.5}
洞府被井然有序地分割成了几个独立的空间，药田内还种植着几株尚未采摘的灵植。¤Dongfu is divided into several independent spaces in an orderly manner, and there are still a few unpicked spiritual plants planted in the medicinal field.
看来洞府的主人只是临时外出，并未放弃这处洞府。刚刚破除的阵法应该已经惊动了他，继续留在这里可能会遇到危险，你决定...？¤It seems that the owner of the cave mansion is only temporarily out, and has not given up on this cave mansion. The formation just broken should have alarmed him. If you continue to stay here, you may encounter danger. You decide...?
想来此处洞府已经荒废，有价值的东西也被统统带走了。你白忙活了一场，心中不免有些失落。¤I want to come here. The cave has been abandoned, and all the valuable things have been taken away. You have been busy working for nothing, and you can't help but feel a little lost in your heart.
练功房外布下的单独的禁制，颇为精妙。为了破开禁制花费了你不少的时间，但也算收货颇丰。¤The solitary prohibition placed outside the practice room is quite subtle. It took you a lot of time to break the prohibition, but it was also considered a good harvest.
不同灵药的采摘方式截然不同，稍有不慎便会药性大减。你小心翼翼地将药田内种植的灵药采摘一空，花费了你不少的时间。¤Different Pill picking methods are completely different, and a little carelessness will greatly reduce the potency. You carefully pick out the Pill planted in the medicinal field, and it takes you a lot of time.
没想到你竟然做出如此卑劣之事，我们之间的交情是被狗吃了么？¤I didn't expect you to do such a despicable thing. Was the friendship between us eaten by dogs?
时间紧迫，一些重要的房间应该还设有单独的禁制，你决定...？¤Time is running out. Some important rooms should also have separate restrictions. You decide...?
哼，看在我们过去的交情上，这次我便饶你一回，若还有下次，就别怪我不留情面了！¤Hmph, based on our past friendship, I will spare you this time. If there is another time, don't blame me for being merciless!
丹房外布有一些简单的禁制，但更多应是为了隔热与预防炸炉，不难破解。你在这里找到了一张遗落的丹方。¤There are some simple restrictions on the outside of the pill room, but more should be for heat insulation and prevention of the fryer. It is not difficult to crack. Here you have found a missing pill.
洞府被井然有序地分割成了几个独立的空间，但目光所及之处都空空如也。¤Dongfu is divided into several independent spaces in an orderly manner, but everything is empty as far as the eye can see.
练功房外布下的单独的禁制，颇为精妙。为了破开禁制花费了你不少的时间，可惜你在里面什么也没有找到。¤The solitary restriction placed outside the practice room is quite subtle. It took you a lot of time to break the restriction, but unfortunately you didn't find anything inside.
练功房外布下的单独的禁制，颇为精妙。为了破开禁制花费了你不少的时间，但也算有所收获。¤The solitary prohibition placed outside the practice room is quite subtle. It took you a lot of time to break the prohibition, but it is also a gain.
我方才感受到大殿中有一丝白帝的气息，便想着过来看看。¤I felt a hint of the White Emperor in the Great Hall, so I thought I'd come and take a look.
明山散人一边说着，竹山宗的掌门赶紧将请帖递了上去。前者随手接过，看过之后却陷入了沉思。¤As Ming Shan Sanren spoke, the head of the Bamboo Mountain Sect hurriedly handed over the invitation. The former casually took it, but after reading it, he fell into deep thought.
原来如此...不过明山老祖生性恬淡，如今也不知...¤I see... But the old ancestor of Ming Shan was a quiet person by nature, and now he doesn't know...
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来贵派邀请明山前辈届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension, and has asked me to come to your school to invite Senior Ming Shan to observe the ceremony at that time.
多谢{FirstName}{daoyou}告知。但明山老祖生性恬淡，如今也不知...¤Thanks {FirstName}{daoyou} for telling me. But the old man of Ming Shan was born quietly and now he doesn't know...
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来贵派邀请明山道友届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension, and has asked me to come to your school to invite Daoist Fellow Daoist Ming Shan to observe the ceremony at that time.
白帝即将准备渡劫飞升，特意让我来邀请明山师祖届时前往观礼。¤The White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension and has specially asked me to invite Master Ming Shan to come and observe the ceremony at that time.
你瞅准时机直接冲入其中，一阵天旋地转之后，出现在一处洞窟之中。¤You see the right moment to rush straight into it, and after a moment of skyward spinning, you appear in a cave.
半空中起伏一阵空间波动。¤A wave of spatial fluctuations rose and fell in mid-air.
嗯？这似乎是通往一处前人洞府。\n¤Hmm? This seems to lead to a former cave. \n
实在对不住，道友。我还有要事同族中商议，暂时不与你多聊了。¤I'm really sorry, fellow daoist. I still have important issues to discuss with my clan, so I won't talk to you more for now.
这魔修竟如此明目张胆到宁州撒野，真是岂有此理！¤It's really unreasonable that this evil cultivator went to Ning Province so blatantly!
再来练两手？¤Let's practice both hands again?
你要战，那便战。¤If you want to fight, then fight.
地魔锋锐的尖爪带着阴风袭向你，正当你以为自己将命丧此地之时突生异变。¤The sharp claws of the earth demon carried the yin wind towards you, and you suddenly changed when you thought you were going to die here.
多亏贵宗力挽狂澜，助我等灭杀地魔！¤Thanks to Guizong's efforts to turn the tide and help me to kill the demons!
另一旁的炎萧与萧千绝从天而降，借冲力将手中法宝用力撞向地魔头颅。一阵令人牙酸的尖利摩擦声过后那地魔头骨终于支撑不住寸寸开裂！¤On the other side, Yan Xiao and Xiao Qianjue descended from the sky, using the impulse to slam the magic weapon into the head of the earth demon. After a toothy, sharp rubbing sound, the skull of the earth demon finally could not hold up to crack!
我们商议过后一致同意奖赏{FirstName}{shidi}一颗聚顶丹，其它于此战中出力的弟子归宗后均能得到己宗奖赏。¤After discussing, we unanimously agreed to reward {FirstName}{shidi} a Core Condensing Pill, and other disciples who contributed to this battle will be rewarded by their own sect.
几位宗门领头弟子汇集一旁，似是共同商议着什么。¤Several leading disciples of the sect gathered together, seemingly discussing something together.
临行前本宗长老曾将传音玉符交予我，叮嘱若试炼生变可与宗门沟通。如今你我一同消灭地魔，灵力多有消耗，再于此地停留恐生意外。¤Before leaving, the elder of the sect gave me the sound transmission jade talisman and told me to communicate with the sect if he tried to change his life. Now you and I destroy the earth demons together, which consumes much spiritual power, and stay here again for fear of accidents.
而后跟上的弟子来势汹汹，趁此机会刀刀劈向地魔要害，在接连不断的攻击下魔物轰然倒地，眼看不活了。¤Then the disciple who followed was fierce, and took this opportunity to slash at the demon's vital point. Under the continuous attacks, the monster fell to the ground, making it hard to live.
大家最为关心的地魔战利品我等已分配完毕，{FirstName}{LastName}{shidi}这次出力最大，功不可没。¤I have already allocated the trophies that everyone cares about the most. {FirstName}{LastName}{shidi} contributed the most this time.
外界各宗长老经商榷决定协力提前开启传送，结束本次试炼。再过不久诸位便可回到宁州，请做好准备。¤After discussion, the elders of the outside sects decided to start teleportation in advance and end this trial. You will be able to return to Ning Province soon, please be prepared.
在众人的合力攻击下，地魔终于支撑不住，轰然倒地，眼看便是不活了。¤Under the combined attack of everyone, the Earth Demon finally couldn't hold it back, and fell to the ground crashingly. It seemed to be dead.
大家最为关心的地魔战利品我等已分配完毕，于此战中出力的弟子归宗后均能得到己宗奖赏。¤I have allocated the trophies of the Earth Demon that everyone cares most about, and all the disciples who contributed to this battle will be rewarded by their own sect after returning to the clan.
你以一己之力竟生生压制住了地魔，一旁的炎萧与李青麟等人也趁势配合你一起攻击魔物。¤You have suppressed the earth demon with your own strength, and Yan Xiao, Li Qinglin and others on the side also took advantage of the situation to cooperate with you to attack the monster.
休得伤人！¤Hugh hurts!
你听着大家的欢呼声，不由地长出了一口气。¤Listening to everyone's cheers, you couldn't help but let out a breath.
只见李青麟唤出数道藤蔓捆住了你，将你向后一扯，堪堪躲过魔物的攻击。¤I saw Li Qinglin call out several vines to bind you, and pull you back, so that you can escape the attack of monsters.
你心有戚戚地靠在石壁上听着众人欢呼，只恨自己成为此行拖累。¤You leaned on the stone wall with a sad heart and listened to the cheers of the crowd, only hating yourself for being a drag on this trip.
这是一个{$Var1}的秘境，你随着灵气流动的方向很快找到了{$Var2}。¤This is a secret realm of {$Var1}, and you quickly found {$Var2} following the direction of the aura flowing.
还是尽快返回宗门，将这{$Var2}交给掌门为好。¤It is better to return to the sect as soon as possible and give this {$Var2} to the head.
没想到化尘教竟混入了魔门卧底...如此看来我派也需要仔细核查了。¤Unexpectedly, the Huachen Cult was mixed into the Demon Sect Undercover... So it seems that my school also needs to check carefully.
慕容颖正忙着与宗门内的修士交流，似乎没有注意到你的到来。¤Murongying is busy communicating with the cultivators in the sect, and seems to have not noticed your arrival.
不过接下来我要传你的{$shentong}乃人阶上品神通，唯有对{$xi}系的大道感悟达到{color=#d0380a}初窥门径{/color}方可领悟。¤However, the next {$shentong} I'm going to pass on to you is a human-grade upper magic skill, which can only be comprehended if you have reached {color=#d0380a} the first glimpse of the {$xi} system of the great path{/color}.
先释放手印，便可以触发后续神通的五行连击效果。若能掌握好这一点，撑过傀儡的攻击也就不难了。¤By releasing the hand seal first, you can trigger the five elemental combinations effect of the subsequent magic skill. If you can master this, it will not be difficult to survive the puppet's attack.
嗯，看来你掌握的不错，功力也是大有长进。¤Well, it seems that you have mastered it well and your skills have grown considerably.
它还是少见的{color=#d0380a}双属性{/color}神通，所以能够灵活触发两种不同的连击效果，妙用无穷。你且收下，好好回去领悟吧。¤It is also a rare {color=#d0380a}double attribute {/color} magic skill, so it can flexibly trigger two different combinations of effects, which is wonderful. You should take it and go back to understand it.
而另一边，琚运琦竟硬生生的从公孙府众人布下的阵法中冲了出去。¤On the other hand, Ju Yunqi actually rushed out of the formation set up by the Gongsun House crowd in a hard way.
你没能拦下赤目老祖，他化作一道血色的遁光，消失不见了。¤You failed to stop the Red-eyed Ancestor, who disappeared into a blood-coloured transporting light.
尽管底牌尽出，赤目老祖还是没能从你手下逃出。¤Despite all his cards, the Red-eyed Ancestor was unable to escape from under you.
这小子体内的气息，绝非正道，动手先拿下他。¤The Qi in this kid's body is definitely not orthodox, take him down first.
（不好，此人回答滴水不漏，观其神色也没有破绽）¤(No, this person answered that there is no leakage, and there is no flaw in his expression)
近日来你对倪家和白帝楼的情况很关心嘛？¤Are you concerned about the situation of Ni's house and White Emperor Manor in recent days?
（老头，帮我分辨一下他到底有没有问题。）¤(Old man, help me tell if he has any problems.)
李天面色一变¤Li Tian's complexion changed
{FirstName}{gongzi}，我还有事，可能要先告辞了。¤{FirstName}{gongzi}, I have something else to do. I may have to leave first.
听闻，李兄今日修为大进，特来拜会。¤I heard that brother Li has a powerful cultivation base and thus I'm here to pay a visit!
哈哈哈，本届魁首如此抬爱，在下自当奉陪。¤Hahaha, the winner of this year's Young Hero Competition is too kind and comes themselves to accompany me?
请进。\n¤Please come in.\n
这小子体内的气息，和那墨居仁出自同源，动手先拿下他。¤The breath in this kid's body is from the same source as that of Mo Juren. Take him down first.
哎，李兄此番相谈甚欢，再多饮几杯吧。¤Hey, Brother Li has a very happy conversation this time, so let's drink a few more glasses.
白帝楼，乃是天下剑修圣地，我自然也是向往的。¤The Baidi Tower is a holy place for swordsmanship in the world, and I naturally yearn for it too.
嗯？古神教？那就没错了。\n¤Huh? Ancient Gods? That's right.\n
李天，是我。有一位道友想要结交你，特来拜访。¤Li Tian, ​​it's me. There is a fellow Taoist who wants to make friends with you, and he is here to visit.
《吐纳功法》，不过是人阶下品的功法，你这个年纪能以此修炼到炼气巅峰，也是天赋异禀了。¤The White Emperor Pavillion is a holy place for many sword cultivators, I naturally long for it too.
哦？不装了？¤Oh? Not pretending anymore?
...我不过是在一处秘境之中有所收获，比不得道友你作为天之骄子，更是夺得本届魁首。¤...I've just gained something in a secret realm, it's not much compared to the pride of the heavens, as true talent, fellow daoist.
酒过三巡、饭过五味¤...You and Li Tian hang out through three rounds of wine and five courses of food.
此时他面露痛苦，一丝诡异的气息从他体内溢出，只见他快速的服用了一枚丹药。之后面色狰狞的对你说。¤At this moment, his face shows pain and a strange aura spills out from his body, only to see him quickly take a potion. Afterwards, with a grimace on his face, he says to you.
拿命来！！¤I'll take your life!!!
{FirstName}{gongzi}，你知道吗？自从种下了这魔神蛊，我修为一日千里，但却也受尽折磨，就是为了把你们这些天之骄子踩在脚下！！¤{FirstName}{gongzi}, do you know? Ever since I took on this Demon God Gu, I've cultivated for a long time! I've even been in immense pain all just to trample on talents like you!
{xiaozi}，叫你冒冒失失的，这下下不来台了吧。¤(...No, this person answered too perfectly, there is nothing suspicious and there is no flaw in his expressions..)
没想到恶饕这老东西当年夺了本座精血，竟然把自己弄成了这副人不人鬼不鬼的样子。¤I didn't expect that this old thing, Evil Taotao, had taken my essence blood back then and had made himself into this inhuman and ghostly appearance.
这白帝也算是一代天骄，真是可惜了...¤This White Emperor is also considered a generation of heavenly pride, what a pity...
你沉思片刻，给公孙季留下一符传音后，才向九嶷山赶去...¤You ponder for a moment and leave a talismanic transmission to Gongsun Ji before rushing towards Jiuyi Mountain...
此事还需先告知公孙兄知晓...¤We need to inform Brother Gongsun of this matter first...
重新回到这里，真是恍若隔世...¤Going back here, it feels like a world away...
魏老，你之前所说的秘阁在何处？¤Old Wei, where is the secret pavilion you mentioned before?
回想当年，真是恍若隔世...¤Looking back on that year, it feels like a world away...
看那里的铸剑阁，经过那里再向前继续走便是秘阁的入口了。¤Look at the Zhujian Pavilion there, pass there and then continue to move forward, it is the entrance of the secret pavilion.
过去这么多年，这里倒是和当年来时没有太大的变化。¤In the past so many years, this place has not changed much from the past.
虽是许久无人维护，但是你仍可以看出此地是洞府主人的丹房。¤Although it has been unmaintained for a long time, you can still tell that this place is the pill room of the master of the cave.
你发现一尊还在运转的丹炉，里面保有炼制完成但尚未取出的丹药。¤You find a pill furnace that is still in operation, which contains the pill that has been refined but has not been taken out.
你发现一尊完好无损的丹炉。¤You found a pill furnace intact.
你在角落发现一张完好无损的丹方。¤You found an intact pill in the corner.
{xiaozi}，以后我老人家罩着你。¤{xiaozi}, my old man will cover you from now on.
这里暂时没有需要你做的事。¤There is nothing you need to do here.
你上前劈手夺过三眼灵猴护到自己身后，血煞老怪猝不及防受了一击，怪叫一声向后跳开几丈远。¤You stepped forward and snatched the three-eyed monkey to protect behind you. The old monster Blood was caught off guard and jumped back several feet with a strange cry.
哼，你禾山道在宁州作威作福，欺害无辜，如今是该付出代价了！¤Hmph, you Heshan Dao dominated Ning Province and deceived the innocent. Now it's time to pay the price!
你在一旁看他们张罗了多时，也没见有什么猿类的灵兽跑出来，倒是一旁的禾山道修士已经有几个坚持不住，开始减弱灵力屏障，暗自偷起懒来。¤You have been watching them for a long time, and you haven't seen any ape-like spirit beasts running out. On the other hand, some of the Heshan Taoist cultivators on the side can't hold on, and begin to weaken the spiritual barrier, secretly getting lazy.
他面色又惊又疑，似是在思忖你何以能从他手中夺去那三眼灵猴。很快地，他的脸色阴鸷了几分，看来是猜到了你的来意。¤He looked surprised and suspicious, as if he was thinking about how you could snatch the three-eyed monkey from his hand. Soon, his face became gloomy a bit, and he seemed to have guessed what you came from.
血煞老怪一副洋洋得意的表情，想来是已把三眼灵猴的妖丹视为囊中之物。你颇有不爽，决定...¤Old Blood Monster has a triumphant expression, thinking that he has already regarded the three-eyed monkey's demon pill as something in his bag. You are quite upset, you decide...
你见此也想停下运转的灵力屏障，熟料一道金光闪过，接踵而至的便是重物撞击的声音。¤When you see this, you want to stop the moving spiritual barrier. A golden light of clinker flashes, followed by the sound of heavy objects hitting.
有了你的妖丹，我突破元婴有望了！¤With your demon pill, I am hopeful that I will break through the Nascent Soul!
但你又岂能让他如愿？¤But will you not let him have his way?
不消多时，那光团便被血煞老怪攫入手中。¤It didn't take long before the light ball was grabbed by the old blood evil monster.
灵猴被后方的手拎起，发出一连串愤怒的叫声。而那手的主人，正是禾山道的大首领——血煞老怪。¤The monkey was picked up by the hand behind and made a series of angry screams. The owner of that hand is the big leader of Heshan Dao-Old Monster Blood.
哈哈哈哈，这下看你往哪逃！¤Hahahaha, now it's up to you where to escape!
它光滑柔顺的毛发，隐隐能看到浅淡的金光在毛发中流转。额正中的灵目也炯炯有神，灵慧的眸光似有实型般令人生畏。¤It's smooth and supple hair, and you can faintly see the light golden light flowing in the hair. The spiritual eyes in the middle of the forehead are also piercing and bright, and the luminous eyes are intimidating as if they are solid.
禾山道修士的灵力屏障对那光团而言虽弱，却也阻拦了它几息时间，血煞老怪自然不会放弃这样的机会，脚下法宝嗡嗡作响，显然是运足了灵气去追那东西。¤Although the spiritual barrier of the cultivator of Heshan Road is weak for the light group, it also blocked its breath time. The old blood evil will naturally not give up such an opportunity. The magic weapon hums under his feet, and it is obviously lucky. Reiki chased that thing.
你有些好奇，运起遁术悄悄跟了上去。¤You are a little curious, and Yunqi Escape Technique quietly followed.
你屏息观察，约有一炷香后血煞老怪追着一团金色光影飞快掠过，那金色光影直接穿破禾山道修士凝成的灵力屏障，窜向山林深处。¤You hold your breath and observe, about a stick of incense, the old blood evil monster chased a group of golden light and shadow quickly passing by, the golden light and shadow directly penetrated the spiritual barrier formed by the cultivators of Heshan Road, and rushed to the depths of the forest.
你定睛一看，一只头生三目的猴子跌落在地，想来便是那禾山道修士口中的三眼灵猴了。¤When you look closely, a first-born three-eyed monkey fell to the ground, thinking it was the three-eyed monkey in the mouth of the Heshan Taoist cultivator.
它仿佛还残留着对你的印象，毛绒绒的猴脸上一副恳求的神情，似乎是在乞求你放它离开。¤It seems to still have an impression of you, and a pleading look on the plush monkey's face seems to be begging you to let it go.
来幽谷捉这三眼灵猴，恐怕也是为结婴觅一份机缘。¤Come to the valley to catch these three-eyed monkeys, I am afraid it is also a chance for a breakthrough.

With its smooth and supple hair, you can faintly see the light golden light flowing in the hair. The spiritual eyes in the middle of the forehead are also bright and bright, and the eyes are bright and witty. It's as intimidating as there are real models.
你依稀记得，离开禾山道时他还是精神矍铄的老头，如今竟面色蜡黄，一副油尽灯枯之相。¤You vaguely remember that when he left Heshan Dao, he was still a spirited old man, and now he has a sallow complexion, with a dry look.
吱吱——¤Squeak--
多谢大哥照拂，我定会仔细那畜生！¤Thank you elder brother for taking care of me, I will be careful of that brute!
{xiaozi}何故三番两次隐藏修为来我禾山道撒野？¤{xiaozi} Why do I hide my cultivation base twice and come to my Heshan Dao so wild?
得了你的承诺，那禾山道修士放心地前去指挥其他修士了。¤With your promise, the cultivator of Heshan Road can go and command other cultivators with confidence.
你的灵力屏障发出砰砰的巨大响声，随即一个棕褐色的毛团滚落地面。¤Your spiritual barrier made a loud bang, and then a tan hair ball rolled to the ground.
{xiaozi}何故与我禾山道作对？¤{xiaozi} Why is against my Heshan Dao?
别说大哥不照顾你，我给你挑这个地方最省事了，就算偷偷懒别人也看不见什么...不过你可别太懈怠，万一那猴子真从你这儿跑了我俩可都完了。¤Don't say that elder brother doesn't take care of you, I'll pick this place for you the most trouble-free. Even if you are lazy, others can't see anything... But don't be too slack, if the monkey really runs away from you, we can both It's over.
你{xiaozi}做得不错，今日捉捕三眼灵猴之事多亏有你助力，待本座神功大成，定少不了你的好处！¤You {xiaozi} have done a good job, today's capture of the three-eyed spirit monkey thanks to your help, when my divine kung fu is complete, will not be missing your benefits!
吱吱！吱吱！¤Squeak! Squeak!
多年不见，它原本就光滑锃亮的皮毛愈发柔顺，隐隐能看到浅淡的金光在毛发中流转。额正中的灵目也愈发有神，炯炯的眸光似有实型般令人生畏。¤It hasn't been seen for many years. Its originally smooth and shiny fur has become more and more supple, and you can faintly see the light golden light flowing in the hair. The spiritual eyes in the middle of the forehead have become more and more energetic, and the bright eyes seem to have a real shape. fear.
禾山道修士将你带进一个角落，压低声音偷偷和你说道。¤The Heshan Dao cultivator led you into a corner, lowered his voice and secretly said to you.
你心神一动，正要有所行动之时一只大手从后方伸出，一把抓住了三眼灵猴的后颈皮。¤Your mind moved, and when you were about to do something, a big hand stretched out from behind and grabbed the neck of the three-eyed monkey.
你顾虑颇多，并没有当场发作。那血煞老怪拎起灵猴扬长而去，只剩下累得东倒西歪的禾山道修士。¤You have a lot of concerns, and you didn't happen on the spot. The old evil spirit picked up the monkey and drove away, leaving only the Heshandao cultivator who was so tired.
你定睛一看，原来是先前在幽谷追逐过的那只三眼灵猴。¤If you look intently, it turns out that it is the three-eyed monkey that had been chased in the valley before.
尽管此阵相当高明，但以你现在对阵道的理解，仅花了些时间便破去了这阵法。¤Although this formation is quite clever, with your current understanding of the formation dao, it only took some time to break the formation.
此阵相当高明，以你现在对阵道的理解尚不能破阵。¤This formation is quite clever, with your current understanding of the formation dao is not yet able to break the formation.

罢了，既然你不是魔修，那我便不与你再追究此事...你好自为之吧。¤Fine, since you are not a evil cultivator, then I will not pursue this matter with you...you can do it yourself.
杀死金大勇后，你虽有心继续探查，但奈何线索已断，只好作罢。¤After killing Jin Dayong, although you intend to continue exploring, but the clue has been broken, you have to give up.

我若是魔修，又岂会被你打成这样...¤If I were a evil cultivatorer, how could I be beaten like this by you...
你这人实在无理取闹，我三番五次辩白怎么死活听不进耳？¤You are so unreasonable to make trouble, why can't I hear my arguing over and over again?

放走金大勇后，你心有所感，趁自己还没有在王府的安逸生活中迷失了道心，还是尽早远离这是非之地吧...¤After letting Jin Dayong go, you feel a little bit about it. Before you have lost your Dao Xin in the comfortable life of the palace, you should stay away from this place of right and wrong as soon as possible...
我还以为是谁呢？原来是{FirstName}{LastName}，走开走开，别妨碍我发财。¤Who did I think it was? It turned out to be {FirstName}{LastName}. Go away and don't prevent me from getting rich.
{size=31}只是照顾些面子罢了，他那些心思我还能不知道？{/size}¤{size=31}It's just a matter of saving face, I can't help but know what he's thinking. {/size}
{size=31}哼，上次若不是被天魔道骗回中州，哪轮得到那些浑蛋魔修在这闹腾。{/size}¤{size=31}Hmph, if we hadn't been tricked back to the Central State by the Heavenly Demon Dao last time, how would it have been the turn of those bastard evil cultivators to make a scene here. {/size}
辛苦{FirstName}前辈，我这边还众多宗门杂事要处理，便不相送了。¤I'm not going to see you off as I have numerous other clan chores to attend to.
道友客气了。¤Friends of Taoism are polite.
{size=31}嗯。道友此番前来是为了...？{/size}¤{size=31}Hmm. Have you come here for...? {/size}
师祖？¤Master?
{vpunch=10,0.5}{size=33}等，等等！{/size}¤{vpunch=10,0.5}{size=33} etc., etc.! {/size}
辛苦{FirstName}道友，我这边还众多宗门杂事要处理，便不相送了。¤I'm not going to see you off as I have many other clan chores to attend to.
{size=31}好你个凌老头，竟还有这等雄心。{/size}¤{size=31}Good for you, old man Ling, to have such ambition. {/size}
白帝前辈即将准备渡劫飞升，特让我来贵派邀请混元子前辈届时前往观礼。¤Senior White Emperor is about to prepare for his ascension, and has asked me to come to your school to invite Senior Mixer to come and observe the ceremony at that time.
师祖，白帝前辈应该是有深意。¤Master, the White Emperor senior should have a deep meaning.
{FirstName}前辈...混元子师祖他就是这脾气...还请多担待。¤{FirstName}Senior... He has a temper like that... Please bear with me.
{size=31}呵，不就是飞升观礼嘛，直接用传音符告诉我不就行了，竟还特意让道友跑上一趟。{/size}¤{size=31}Huh, it's just an ascension ceremony, just tell me with a voice transmission talisman, how dare you make a special trip. {/size}
未等你和葛白袍再说什么，混元子便已是施展遁术急冲冲地离开了大殿。¤Before you and Ge Baiyao could say anything else, Mixing Yuanzi had already left the Great Hall in a hurry by casting a transport technique.
{size=31}不过白袍他们也确实不争气，还是要多谢道友啊。{/size}¤{size=31}But it's true that the white robes and the others don't compete, so thanks a lot, Daoist. {/size}
{size=31}稍后再说，我得亲自去一趟白帝楼。{/size}¤{size=31}Later, I have to go to the Whitty House myself. {/size}
{FirstName}道友，这位则是我玄道宗的混元子师祖，宁州这边主要是由他老人家负责。¤{This is the master of my Mystic Dao Sect, Master Mixing Yuanzi, who is mainly responsible for the Ning Province side.
大殿正中，除恭敬地立于偏位的葛白袍外，另有一位看似普通却普通得过分了些的修士坐于大殿正首。¤In the middle of the hall, apart from Ge Baiyao, who stood respectfully on the side, another ordinary-looking but overly ordinary cultivator sat at the head of the hall.
{size=31}呵，不就是飞升观礼嘛，直接用传音符告诉我不就行了，竟还特意遣人将请帖送上门来。{/size}¤{size=31}Huh, it's just an ascension ceremony, just tell me with a voice messenger, why did you send the invitation to my door? {I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get the invitation.}
师祖，这位便是上次救玄道宗于水火之中的道友。¤Master, this is the Daoist friend who saved the Mystic Dao Sect from the fire last time.
{size=31}嗯。凌老头派你来是有何事？{/size}¤{size=31}Hmm. What did old man Ling send you here for? {/size}
白帝师兄即将准备渡劫飞升，特让我来贵派邀请道友届时前往观礼。¤Brother Bai Di is about to prepare for his ascension and has asked me to come to your school to invite you to observe the ceremony.
无妨，那我便先告辞了。¤No matter, then I will take my leave.
{FirstName}道友...混元子师祖他就是这脾气...还请多担待。¤{FirstName}Daoist... He has a temper like this... Please bear with me.
{size=31}不过白袍他们也确实不争气，多谢小友了。{/size}¤{size=31}But the white robes and the others really don't compete, thanks a lot, little friend. {/size}
前辈客气了。¤Seniors are very kind.
师祖，这位便是上次救玄道宗于水火之中的前辈。¤Master, this is the senior who saved the Mystic Dao Sect from the fire last time.
{FirstName}前辈，这位则是我玄道宗的混元子师祖，宁州这边主要是由他老人家负责。¤{This is the senior of the Mystic Dao Sect, and this is Master Mixer, who is mainly responsible for the Ning Province side.
无尽海渊的灵气乱流似乎比往日更加猛烈了...¤The turbulent aura of the endless sea seems to be more violent than before...
不错，如今阵基被毁，在这无尽海渊之中恐怕再也找不到一处灵气像这样稳定的修炼宝地了。¤Yes, now that the formation base has been destroyed, I am afraid that in this endless abyss, I will never find a stable cultivation treasure place like this.
深海章鱼在这无尽之海中虽然数量众多，但数万年来唯有九幽能够突破至化神期，靠的应该就是这神奇的聚灵阵法。¤Although there are many deep-sea octopuses in this endless sea, for tens of thousands of years, only Jiuyou has been able to break through to Deity Transformation, and it should rely on this magical gathering method.
{FirstName}妹妹，我看你资质不错，不知道对星宫的秘术有没有兴趣？¤{FirstName}Sister, I see that you have good Aptitudes, I wonder if you are interested in the secret arts of the Star Palace?
竟是花茶？真是少见。¤It is a flower tea? It is really rare.
哦？我还以为林家的客人多厉害，结果就只是个英杰会亚军啊，呵呵。¤Oh? I thought how powerful the guest of the Lin family was, but it turned out to be just a runner-up of the Yingjie Association, huh?
常人只道“人面桃花相映红”，却不知这雨后粉梅不仅花如笑靥，更有暗香浮动，摄人心魄。¤Common people only say human face peach blossom reflecting red, but I do not know that the rain after the pink plum not only flowers like a smile, but also a dark fragrance floating, the soul.
{FirstName}道友，我去为王道友取茶具，失陪一会。¤Wang Deng was about to say something else, but Lin Muxue returned to the garden in due course with the tea set, so he had to keep his mouth shut.
好在林沐雪及时带着茶具回到花园，王登才重新把注意力转移到林沐雪身上。¤It was a good think that Lin Muxue arrived with the teaset at this time, Wang Deng quickly moved his attention to her.
林沐雪再想说什么时，一位看似儒雅的修士闯入亭中。¤When Lin Mu Xue wanted to say something else, an elegant-looking Vagrant Cultivator barged into the pavilion.
妹妹心动了吧，嘿嘿，哥哥今日就让你开开眼界。¤Sister heart moved it, hey, brother let you open your eyes today.
见过王前辈。¤Greetings, senior Wang.
你我不过是初见，王前辈请自重。¤You and I are only the first time to meet, senior Wang please respect yourself.
照往常规律所推算，今日便应当是有灵雨了。¤According to the usual pattern of projections, today should be a spiritual rain.
这位是上一届英杰会冠军得主{FirstName}道友。{FirstName}道友，这位是星宫筑基后期修士王道友。¤This is the winner of the last Yingjie Tournament, Fellow Daoist {FirstName}. Daoist friend {FirstName}, this is Daoist friend Wang, a late stage Foundation Establishment Vagrant Cultivator of the Star Palace.
不错嘛，刚参加完英杰会就筑基了，不会是为区区筑基丹特意压制境界了吧？¤Not bad, just after participating in the Yingjie meeting to build the foundation, it is not for a small foundation pill purposely suppress the realm, right?
不过是区区英杰会冠军，凭此就想攀附林家这棵大树？¤But only the champion of the Yingjie Association, with this you want to climb the Lin family this big tree?
林沐雪闻言也是掩嘴轻笑，旋即将话题转到之前你与林沐心在英杰会的激斗上。¤Lin Mu Xue also covered her mouth and laughed lightly, and then turned the topic to the previous fierce fight between you and Lin MuXin in the Ying Jie Hui.
哼，雪儿刚才竟然为了你斥责我，还想让我信你的鬼话？¤Hmph, Xue'er just rebuked me for you, and you want me to believe your bullshit?
哼，本看你有几分姿...仙缘，想要指点你一番，没想到竟是如此不识好歹。¤Hmph, I saw that you have a few postures... Immortal edge, want to guide you some, did not expect to be so insensitive.
眼下四周静谧，只闻灵雨淅沥，又见雪梅染粉，大有疏雨过境，虹唤梅醒之意。¤Right now the surrounding silence, only to hear the spiritual rain, and see the snow plum dyed pink, a sparse rain transit, the rainbow called the plum awake.
林沐雪见到来者时眉头略微一皱，但也仅是持续刹那而已，甚至让你怀疑自己是否有看错。¤Lin Mu Xue frowned slightly when she saw the visitor, but it only lasted for a moment, and even makes you wonder if you have seen wrong.
辛苦雪儿了。¤Thank you for your hard work, Xue'er.
嘁，我王登就这么个性子，请多包涵。¤Ch, I Wang Deng is such a nature, please bear with me.
不用担心，我和林姑娘只是初识而已。¤Don't worry, Miss Lin and I are just getting to know each other.
林沐雪见此也只是轻叹一口气，一副司空见惯的样子。显然这王登已经不是第一次在女性修士面前表现得如此不得体。¤Lin Mu Xue see this also just a light sigh, a look of commonplace. Obviously this is not the first time that Wang Deng has behaved so indecently in front of female Vagrant Cultivators.
还请王道友称呼我为林道友。¤I would also like to ask fellow Daoist Wang to address me as fellow Daoist Lin.
早就听说公孙道友阵法上的造诣超群，只是没想到他还深谙诗赋，当真令人佩服。¤I've heard that Daoist Gongsun's attainments in Array are superb, but I didn't expect him to be well versed in poetry, which is really admirable.
你绘声绘色地向林沐雪讲述，后者则是听得聚精会神。待你讲到惊险部分时，她也是低声惊呼，一副担心的样子。¤You tell Lin Mu Xue in a colorful way, the latter is listening intently. When you reached the dangerous part, she also whispered in alarm and looked worried.
道友且看眼前的灵木。¤Daoist friend and look at the spirit wood in front of you.
{FirstName}道友是我林府的贵客，还请王道友礼貌些。¤Fellow Daoist {FirstName} is an honored guest of my Lin Mansion, please be polite to fellow Daoist Wang.
你接过林沐雪递来的茶盏，道谢过后浅饮一口。不同于常见茶类伴着微苦的清香，而是一种淡淡的馨香在你口中萦绕不散，不但鲜灵更是回味十足。¤You accept the tea handed to you by Lin Mu Xue, say thank you and then take a shallow sip. Unlike the common tea with a slightly bitter fragrance, but a light fragrance in your mouth lingered, not only fresh spirit is full of aftertaste.
只要你叫我一声好哥哥，就让你好好了解下，嘿嘿嘿。¤As long as you call me a good brother, let you understand well, hehehehe.
好的，林姑娘不必担心我。¤Okay, Miss Lin need not worry about me.
早就听说星宫的双修秘术天下无双，没想到今日竟能得以一见。¤I've heard that the Star Palace's dual cultivation techniques are unparalleled in the world, I never thought I would be able to see it today.
至于你小子，离我家雪儿远一点，她可是要与我王登结为道侣，岂是你可以染指的。¤The toxicity of Dragon's beard root.
心动倒不是，只是感慨普通修士筑基就已是很难，星宫秘术却能让你这种沉迷声色的凡俗如此年纪便修炼到筑基后期，实在是令我大开眼界。¤The first time I saw this, I was very impressed with the fact that it was already very difficult for ordinary Vagrant Cultivators to build a foundation, but the Star Palace secret art allows you to cultivate to the late foundation stage at such a young age of a mortal who is addicted to sex, which is really an eye-opener for me.
这位是上一届英杰会亚军得主{FirstName}道友。{FirstName}道友，这位是星宫筑基后期修士王道友。¤This is the runner-up winner of the last Yingjiehui {FirstName} Daoist friend. {FirstName}Daoist friend, this is the late stage Foundation Establishment Vagrant Cultivator of the Star Palace, Daoist friend Wang.
王道友你好。¤Hello, Daoist friend Wang.
万木千花路不定，辰溪看绝始有亭。\n雪落枝头云初聚，披虹沐雨见本心。¤The road of thousands of trees and flowers is uncertain, and the cinnabar creek is the first pavilion to see the end. \n snow falls on the branches of the first gathering of clouds, Phi rainbow and rain to see the heart.
林沐雪没有再多说什么，径直离开花园。¤Lin Mu Xue did not say anything more and left the garden straight away.
此诗乃是云汐城公孙公子前些年来林府拜访时所留，非沐雪所作，让道友见笑了。¤This poem was left by Mr. Gongsun of Yunshi City when he visited the Lin residence some years ago, not by Mu Xue.
道友请用茶。¤Daoist friend, please use the tea.
王登语气虽然还有些不善，但好歹算是道歉了。林沐雪也不好再说什么，只得满脸歉意的看向你。¤Wang Deng's tone was still a bit unkind, but it was at least an apology. Lin Mu Xue also can not say anything else, only to look at you with a face full of apologies.
此景甚得老祖喜欢，故名之曰——疏雨粉梅，亦是因此在林府中设立花园，且筑亭为衬。¤This scene is very much like the old ancestor, so the name is said - sparse rain pink plum, is also therefore set up in the Lin House garden, and build a pavilion for the lining.
料是这雪梅染粉难得一见罢，若不是托林姑娘的福，此景我也是闻所未闻。¤The snow plum dyeing powder is rare to see, if not for the blessing of Miss Lin, this scene is also unheard of by me.
你还身在这林家花园中，自然是不想把事情闹大，便只是向林沐雪还以一笑，表示自己并不在乎。后者也是因此松一口气。¤You are still in this Lin family garden, naturally, do not want to make a big deal of things, so just to Lin Mu Xue returned a smile, indicating that they do not care. The latter was also relieved by this.
雪儿，原来你在这，让我一顿好找，你可要补偿我哦。¤Xue'er, so you are here, let me a good search, you have to compensate me oh.
林沐雪领着你穿过偌大个林府后，终于来到了后院中的花园。¤After Lin Mu Xue led you through the large Lin House, finally came to the garden in the backyard.
你们二人一边品茶一边聊了许久，很是愉快。直到若有似无的“滴答”声传入耳中，才转头去欣赏雨中的粉梅。¤The two of you chatted for a long time while sipping tea, and it was very pleasant. The two of you were chatting for a long time while sipping tea, and it was very pleasant until the sound of ticking came into your ears, and then you turned your head to admire the pink plum in the rain.
这么叫不是太生分了嘛，还是叫雪儿好。咦？这小子是谁？¤So called is not too raw, or call Xue'er good. Huh? Who is this kid?
这么叫不是太生分了嘛，还是叫雪儿好。咦，雪儿不给小生介绍一下这位妹妹么？¤The first name is Xue'er. Hey, Xue'er will not introduce this sister to me?
好好交流一番不就熟悉了，{FirstName}妹妹你说是不是呀？¤The first thing you need to do is to get acquainted with it, {FirstName} sister, don't you think so?
以前者的性格，若不是王登真做了什么过分的事情，只怕也不会以什么强硬手段制止他。¤With the former's character, if Wang Deng hadn't really done something excessive, I'm afraid he wouldn't have stopped him with any strong-arm tactics.
从初入林府时便发现四下尽是灵植，葱郁一片，生气盎然，不禁觉得林府本就是一座花园，只是偶有修士的居所藏于花海荫下罢了。至于林沐雪所说的林府花园，恐怕也不过如此，只是多些观景用的亭台楼阁而已。¤From the time you first entered the Lin House, you found that there were spiritual plants all around, lush and vibrant, and you couldn't help but feel that the Lin House was originally a garden, only occasionally the residence of Vagrant Cultivators was hidden under the shade of a sea of flowers. As for the Lin Mu Xue said the Lin House garden, I'm afraid it's just the same, just more pavilions and pavilions for viewing.
今天我王登就要好好教训教训你，让你小子知道什么叫天高地厚！¤Today I Wang Deng will teach you a good lesson, so you know what the sky is high!
之后任王登胡缠蛮搅，你也只是静坐品茶，不再理会他。只是在他的骚扰下，这疏雨粉梅茶的韵味也淡了几分。¤After that, let Wang Deng stir up the nonsense, you just sit quietly and sip tea, no longer pay attention to him. Just under his harassment, the rhythm of this sparse rain powder plum tea has also faded a few points.
看来我今日是有幸一见这疏雨粉梅的奇景了。¤It seems that I am fortunate to see this strange sight of sparse rain and pink plum today.
嘿嘿，{FirstName}妹妹不用客气，叫我王登哥...哦不，王登就好了。¤Hey, {FirstName} sister don't be polite, call me Wang Deng brother... Oh no, Wang Deng is fine.
从花叶来看，这应该是凡间的雪梅，但...这株雪梅近旁灵气异常浓郁，其中可是有什么奥秘？¤Judging from the flowers and leaves, this should be a snow plum of the mortal world, but... This snow plum near the aura is unusually dense, which is what mystery?
{FirstName}道友，我去为王道友取茶具，先失陪一会。¤Daoist {FirstName}, I'll go get another set of tea for daoist Wang.
好景！好诗！我正愁不知如何形容如此仙境，林姑娘真是善解人意。¤What a view! Good poem! I was worried that I didn't know how to describe such a Immortal land, Miss Lin is really kind and understanding.
随后的话题让你深觉无趣，旁听一会后便是告辞离去。¤The subsequent topic makes you feel deeply uninterested, after listening for a while is to say goodbye to leave.
没想到公孙道友不仅阵法上的造诣超群，还深谙诗赋，当真令人佩服。¤I didn't expect that Daoist Gongsun not only has superb attainments in Array, but also is deeply versed in poetry, which is really admirable.
此树名唤疏雨粉梅，乃是林家花园中最为难得的仙品灵木。¤This tree is called sparse rain pink plum, is the most rare immortal spirit wood in the garden of the Lin family.
既名唤粉梅，树上花瓣却尽是雪白，这是为何？¤The name is called pink plum, the tree petals but all snow white, this is why?
这便是疏雨粉梅的神妙之处了。这梅花刚开放时花瓣雪白无暇，且有聚灵之效，待灵气浓郁时便会凝气成云，之后则是灵气雨下，雪梅也就此转变为粉梅。¤This is the miracle of the sparse rain and pink plum. This plum blossom just open when the petals are snow white and flawless, and has the effect of gathering spirit, when the spirit is dense will be condensed into clouds, after that is the spirit rain, the snow plum is also transformed into pink plum.
此番凶险，真是辛苦你了。你能力战元婴期老魔，我此时身无旁物这些灵石送你吧。¤This dangerous danger, it's really hard for you. You can compete with the old demon of the Yuanying stage, I have nothing else to do at this time, these spirit stones will give you.
多谢前辈出手。¤Thanks a lot for your help, seniors.
而被古神教夺去的那柄戮仙剑，则能够释放令人心神动摇的煞气。¤The Immortal Executing Sword, which was taken by the Ancient Gods Sect, is capable of releasing a mind-blowing fury.
当年我还在血剑宫时确实查阅过一些相关的记录。¤I did consult some of the relevant records when I was still in the Blood Sword Palace.
不错，正是如此...¤Yes, exactly...
为什么这些魔门花费那么大的精力也要夺取这些魔剑...它们有什么特殊之处么？¤Why do these demon clans spend so much effort to seize these magic swords... Is there something special about them?
{shidi}可是已经通知到诸位化神？¤{shidi} But have the Deity Transformation cultivators been notified?
这不难理解...毕竟此剑的效果与血剑宫的功法配合的确是相得益彰，或许还能提升他们的修炼速度也未可知。¤It is not difficult to understand... After all, the effect of this sword does complement the Blood Sword Palace's gong methods, and perhaps even enhance their cultivation speed too.
据我所知，血剑宫手中虽有一柄绝仙剑，但他们长期以来更想夺得的却是主长杀伐之力的戮仙剑。¤As far as I know, although the Blood Sword Palace has an Absolute Immortal Sword in its hands, what they have long wanted more than anything else is the Immortal Executing Sword, which excels in killing power.
具体的时间我也不太清楚，不过想来应该不到30年了。¤I'm not sure exactly how long ago it was, but I think it was less than 30 years ago.
具体的时间我也不太清楚，不过想来应该不到40年了。¤I'm not sure exactly how long ago it was, but I think it was less than 40 years ago.
据说这四柄魔剑以诛仙剑为首，各有异能。若能发挥得当，远非寻常通天灵宝可以比拟。¤It is said that these four demonic swords, led by the Immortal Punishing Sword, each have special abilities. If they are used properly, they are far beyond the reach of ordinary heavenly spiritual treasures.
具体的时间我也不太清楚，不过想来应该不到20年了。¤I'm not sure exactly how long ago it was, but I think it was less than 20 years ago.
具体的时间我也不太清楚，不过想来应该不到50年了。¤I'm not sure exactly how long ago it was, but I think it was less than 50 years ago.
血剑宫手中的绝仙剑主防御，传说甚至能抵御一部分天劫的伤害。¤The Absolute Immortal Sword in the hands of the Blood Sword Palace is the main defence, and legend has it that it can even withstand a portion of the Heavenly Tribulation.
比如你手中的这柄诛仙剑，主吞噬，应该有吸收他人灵气的能力。¤For example, this Immortal Punishing Sword in your hand is a master devourer and should have the ability to absorb the aura of others.
天魔道手中的陷仙剑，有困敌与吸人精血之能。¤The Trapping Sword in the hands of the Heavenly Demon Dao has the ability to trap the enemy and suck the blood out of people.
具体的时间我也不太清楚，不过想来应该也就10年左右了。¤I'm not sure exactly how long it's been, but I think it's only been about 10 years.
若能同时收集到四柄魔剑，便可布下诛仙剑阵。此剑阵效果千变万化，以任意一柄魔剑置于阵眼都可以发挥并扩大其本身的效果。¤If you can collect four magic swords at the same time, you can set up the Immortal Execution Sword Formation. The effects of this formation are so varied that any one of them can be placed at the eye of the formation to bring out and amplify its own effects.
师兄放心，诸位化神都表示会前来观礼。¤Don't worry, Brother, all the Deity Transformation have said they will come to observe the ceremony.
好，辛苦了，之后的事便交给我吧。待时机成熟，我会让阿欣通知你的。¤Okay, good work, I'll take care of the rest after that. When the time is right, I'll ask Xin to let you know.
我能隐约感应到天劫将至，应该就在这两年间了。{shidi}可有替我通知各位化神？¤I can vaguely sense that the heavenly tribulation is coming, and it should be within these two years. Has {shidi} informed all the Deity Transformation for me?
为了一己私仇，来找风雨楼买他人性命的从不在少数。¤There are many people who come to Rain or Shine House to assasinate others for their own personal vendetta.
今日要说的就这些了，走吧。¤That's all I have to say today, let's go.
我欣赏你。¤I appreciate you.
哈哈哈...¤Hahahaha...
另外...¤Also...
琚运琦罕见的笑了起来。¤Ju Yunqi smiled in a rare moment.
自从你第一次完成天阶悬赏时，我就知道，你有这个实力。¤I have known since the first time you completed the Heavenly Rank bounty that you had it in you.
所以，特殊目标指的...是那些并非恶名在外，但也有人重金悬赏的目标吧？¤So the special targets are... The ones that are not infamous, but have a big reward, right?
有些特殊的悬赏，我也不好推脱，但你若不想接，自然不必出手。¤There are some special bounties that I can't really put off, but if you don't want to take them, naturally you don't have to do so.
不用急着回答我，进入长老会也并非为我一人效劳，我只是提前告知你此事罢了。¤There is no need to answer me hastily, and it is not for me alone to enter the Council of Elders; I am merely informing you of this in advance.
{$daihao}，你和当年的我...真的很像。¤{$daihao}, you and I back then... It's really similar.
风雨楼中...除了那些对外公开悬赏的目标外，还有一些不便公开悬赏的特殊目标。¤In Wind and Rain House... In addition to those targets that are openly rewarded to the public, there are also special targets for which it is not convenient to offer a public reward.
{$daihao}，风雨楼成立至今，能够成为天字杀手的也不过二十余人。¤{$daihao}, since the establishment of the Rain and Rain Tower, only about twenty people have been able to become Heavenly Assassins.
这次找你来，是有一些事情要告知你。¤I have come to you this time because I have something to inform you.
当然，这是权利，而并非义务。若你对此没有兴趣，大可不必参与。¤This is, of course, a right, not an obligation. If you are not interested in this, there is no need to get involved.
但因为某些特殊的原因，风雨楼正常只会公开接取那些恶名在外的邪修作为目标。¤However, for some special reasons, the Wind and Rain House would normally only openly pick up those evil cultivators who are notorious as targets.
你说的不错，风雨楼祖训自然有它的道理。¤You're right, the Rain or Shine ancestral motto naturally has its validity.
他微微皱起了眉头¤He frowned slightly
他沉思了片刻，似乎是在犹豫。¤He pondered for a moment, seemingly hesitating.
成为天字杀手后，便有权利介入风雨楼长老会，参与风雨楼一些重大事宜的决策。¤After becoming a Heavenly Assassin, one has the right to intervene in the Elders' Council of the Rain or Shine House and participate in the decision making of some major matters of the House.
特殊悬赏的事，你暂时不必放在心上。若有报酬不错的悬赏，我自然会告知你的。¤You don't have to worry about special rewards for now. If there is a reward that pays well, I will naturally let you know.
特殊目标？¤Special targets?
不用急着回答我，风雨楼长老会若无要事也不会召集众长老决议，我只是提前告知你此事罢了。¤There is no need to rush to answer me. The Council of Elders of the Rain and Rain House would not have called for a resolution if there was no important matter, so I am only informing you of this in advance.
这宁王府果然不简单，索性当年没有去趟这浑水...¤This Prince Ning's Mansion is really not easy. I simply didn't go to this muddy water back then...
后来玄道宗派人前来，摸清了整件事原委。正准备将宁王擒拿归案时，却发现那老不死的居然携家眷跑了！¤Later, the Profound Dao Sect sent someone to figure out the whole story. When I was about to capture Ning King and bring him to justice, I found that the old man had gone away with his family!
莫非那白袍修士是玄道宗之人？¤Could the white robe cultivator belong to the Mystic Dao Sect?
哎，兄台。你可知这宁王府到底发生了什么，之前来时不是还办什么天下仙道会，怎么转眼人全都不见了？¤Hey, Xiongtai. Do you know what happened in Prince Ning's Mansion? Didn't you still organize a World Immortal Dao Association when you came here? How come all the people disappeared in a blink of an eye?
他这一走，宁王府的供奉、逸风府的官吏也作鸟兽散，搞得这逸风城群龙无首，我们这些散修倒是还好，只是苦了百姓...¤As soon as he left, the guest elders of Prince Ning's Mansion and the officials of Yifeng Mansion also fled, leaving this Yifeng City rudderless. It is okay for us who are independent cultivators, but the people living here are suffering...
没想到这宁王府竟与魔修有龃龉，索性当年斗法台比试后没有答应入府...¤Unexpectedly, Prince Ning's Mansion was at odds with evil cultivator, and he simply didn't agree to enter the mansion after the fight against Fatai...
嗨，那天下仙道会着实坑人。传闻说宁王与魔门勾结，暗中陷害供奉，以供奉肉身作药引开炉炼丹。¤Hey, the Xiaxian Dao will really cheat people that day. It is rumored that Ning King colluded with the Demon Sect and secretly framed the guest elders, and used their flesh as a medicine to open the furnace to make alchemy.
你决定冒险一试，果然，你刚一碰到这些藤蔓，它们立刻就动了起来，将你紧紧缠住，动弹不得。¤You decided to take a risk. Sure enough, as soon as you touched these vines, they immediately moved, entangled you tightly and couldn't move.
空气中弥漫着一股淡淡的血腥味，你发现这个洞窟深处长满了你此前从未见过的藤蔓类植物。¤There is a faint smell of blood in the air, and you find that the depths of this cave are full of vines that you have never seen before.
这些藤蔓粗细不一，小的只有手指般粗细，大的则有一腰之宽。它们或吸附在岩壁上，或横倒在地，你只能小心翼翼地避开它们。¤These vines vary in thickness. The small ones are as thin as fingers, and the big ones are waist-wide. They are either attached to the rock wall or lying sideways on the ground. You can only avoid them carefully.
再往前走去，这些藤蔓也越发的密集，几乎没有可以下脚的地方了。¤Going further, these vines are getting denser, and there is almost no place to go.
也不知若是触碰到这些藤蔓会发生什么，直觉告诉你它们并不简单，你决定...？¤I don't know what will happen if you touch these vines. Intuition tells you that they are not easy. You decide...?
桀桀，这秘市也算是广陵城每年难得的盛会了。¤Jiejie, this secret city can be regarded as a rare event every year in Guangling City.
不错，化尘教很欢迎你这样的修士入我宗门，我先带你去面见大师姐。¤Yes, Aeonic Sands Temple welcomes cultivators like you to enter our Sect. I will take you to meet the master sister first.
很抱歉你未能通过测试，请回吧。¤Sorry you failed the test, please go back.
多谢道友救命之恩，财物有价生命无价，我只能倾囊以报。¤Thank you fellow daoists for your life-saving grace. The property is priceless and life is priceless. I can only repay it.
好身手，领教{$TmpTalkString}高招了。¤Good skills, I've learned {$TmpTalkString}'s tricks.
在下温杰，不知阁下是...？¤I am Wen Jie, I wonder if your Excellency is...?
两位高人？¤Two high achievers?
{$TmpTalkString}过奖了。说来惭愧，我竹山宗大部分的功法典籍都与这竹山剑法格格不入，所以我独自琢磨了很久也不得要领。¤{$TmpTalkString}I'm flattered. I'm ashamed to say that most of my Bamboo Mountain Sect's Kung Fu texts are not compatible with this Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique, so I've been pondering it alone for a long time but I can't get the hang of it.
{$TmpTalkString}说的是，我也听闻各派都有一套自称一派的剑法传承多年，不过除去金虹与星河两大剑派外，剩下三派的剑法几乎都已经失传了。¤What {$TmpTalkString} said is that I have also heard that each school has a set of sword techniques that have been passed down for many years that claim to be a school, but apart from the two major sword schools, Golden Rainbow and Star River, the sword techniques of the remaining three schools have almost all been lost.
奇遇？那我可就感兴趣了，温兄可有兴致与我说上一二？¤A strange encounter? I'd be interested in that, would you be interested in telling me about it?
我只匆匆翻看了几眼，便又放回了原处。如此一二来去，几番去藏经阁后便已记了个大概。¤I only looked through it a few times and then put it back where I found it. So I went back and forth, and after a few trips to the Bible collection I had memorized it.
我名叫{FirstName}{LastName}，见温兄剑招舞的高明，不由自主便想与你切磋一二。¤My name is {FirstName}{LastName} and I saw how well you danced with your sword and I couldn't help but want to spar with you.
呼...道友的剑招真是高明，此番切磋令我受益颇丰呐。¤Hoo... I have benefited greatly from this sparring session.
哎，这我也不得而知了。从那以后，我虽然修为突飞猛进，却再也没有见到过这两位前辈了。¤Hey, I don't know about that either. Since then, I have never seen these two seniors again, although my cultivation has improved by leaps and bounds.
后来还是经过两位高人指点，才令我的剑道得以突飞猛进的。¤It was only through the guidance of two high masters that I was able to make rapid progress in my swordsmanship.
不过平日里倒是很少听闻竹山宗人善使剑法的，今天算是开了眼了。¤However, it is rarely heard of people from the Zhushan clan who are good at swordplay, today is an eye opener.
不过这门竹山剑法，真是除了温兄以外，再没听别人练过了。¤But this Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique, really except for Brother Wen, no one else has heard of practicing it.
原来温兄的这套剑法竟是这样自学而来的，真是了不起啊。¤It turns out that this sword technique of Brother Wen is self-taught in this way, it is really remarkable.
不过这本《竹山剑法》的秘籍，也不知是不是因为太久无人问津了，竟然被遗落在了一层的一个角落里。¤But this secret book of the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique, I don't know if it has been left unattended for too long, but it was left in a corner on the ground floor.
那日我和往常一样，独自在碧悠潭练着剑，突然却听到有两人的对谈之声。¤That day I was practising my sword alone at the Biyao Pool, as usual, when suddenly I heard the sound of two people talking to each other.
呼...温兄的剑招真是进步神速。今日的切磋令我受益颇丰呐。¤Hoo... Brother Wen's swordsmanship has really improved. I have benefited greatly from today's sparring session.
这两位前辈只闻其声，却不见其人，我知道必然是遇着了了不得的机缘，连忙高声呼喊，请前辈指点。¤These two seniors were only heard but not seen. I knew that I must have encountered a great opportunity, so I hastened to call out loudly and ask for their guidance.
哈哈哈，温兄的剑招进步也很大，今日的切磋我也受益颇丰呐。¤Hahahaha, Brother Wen's sword moves have also improved greatly.
其中一人哈哈笑道：青元啊，没想到你那绣花剑法居然还有人会练。你今日正好来了，不如去指点他一二吧。¤One of them laughed and said, Qing Yuan, I didn't expect that your embroidered sword technique would still be practiced. You happen to be here today, why don't you go and instruct him a bit?
话说回来，你能有如此奇遇，也是因为你过去数年日复一日在这碧悠潭练剑的缘故吧。¤That said, the reason you have had such a strange encounter is because you have been practising your sword day in and day out at this Biyu Pond for the past few years.
好身手，领教阁下高招了。¤Good skill. I now understand your skill.
此事我倒还未曾向他人提起，不过今日难得打的尽兴，与{$TmpTalkString}说说也无妨。¤I haven't mentioned this to anyone yet, but I'm having a good time today, so it wouldn't hurt to talk about it with {$TmpTalkString}.
道友所言有几分道理，但其实我这竹山剑法最为讲究的，却是那生生不息的剑势。¤There is some truth in what you say, but in fact, the most important thing about my Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique is the unending power of the sword.
我不敢明目张胆在宗门广场上练剑，所以此后便常常独自一人来到方壶山的这处碧幽潭练剑。¤I did not dare to practise my sword in plain sight in the clan square, so since then I have often come alone to this Bewitching Pool on Fang Hu Mountain to practise my sword.
道友果然眼光独到啊，一眼便看出了我这竹山剑法的精髓所在。¤You are really discerning, you have seen the essence of my Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique at a glance.
依道友所见，我这剑法如何？¤In your opinion, how is my swordplay?
说不定总有一日，我们也可以修炼到他们那样的境界。到时候，你一定能够再见到那两位前辈的。¤Perhaps one day, we will be able to cultivate to a level like theirs. When that time comes, you will definitely be able to see those two seniors again.
比试切磋需点到为止，咱们就到这里吧。¤Let's stop here.
我会修炼这竹山剑法，说来倒也是因为有过一番奇遇。¤I practised the Bamboo Mountain Sword Technique because I had a strange encounter.
这奇遇还得从我炼气期时说起。{$TmpTalkString}应该知道，宗门藏经阁内的地阶秘籍，是只对筑基期以上的弟子才开放的。¤This strange encounter also has to start when I was in the Qi Refining stage. {$TmpTalkString}You should know that the secret books of the Earth Order in the sect's Hidden Scripture Pavilion are only open to disciples above the Foundation Establishment stage.
于是那名被叫做青元的前辈便随便点出了我的几处问题，句句都直指要害，许多困扰了我数年的问题都迎刃而解了。¤The senior, who was called Qing Yuan, then casually pointed out several of my problems, and every word was to the point, and many of the problems that had plagued me for several years were solved.
道友的剑招也很高明，此番切磋令我也受益颇丰呐。¤Your swordplay is also very good. I have benefited greatly from this sparring session.
哈哈哈，{$TmpTalkString}说的是，我们都该以这样更高的目标努力才是。¤Hahahaha, {$TmpTalkString} says it all, we should all be aiming higher like that.
好好好，今日相谈甚欢，日后若是有什么见闻感悟，也好与{$TmpTalkString}分享。¤Good, Good, We've had a good chat today and if you have any insights in the future, you can share them with {$TmpTalkString}.
太上长老...莫非...莫非这是哪位化神期的前辈！¤The Supreme Elder... Could it be... Could it be that this is one of the seniors of the Deity Transformation Stage!
另外一人辩解道：太上长老，我这点剑法自然入不了你的法眼。不过你这么说，未免太不在小辈面前给我留面子了吧。¤The other one argued, Elder Tai Shang, naturally this bit of swordplay of mine is not up to your standards. But if you say that, you are not giving me face in front of the juniors, are you?
不错不错，好久没遇到过值得一战的对手了。¤Not bad, I haven't met a worthy opponent for a long time.
哈哈哈哈，看来还是本座略胜一筹。¤Hahaha, it seems that this seat is slightly better.
山清水秀，一览无余，好景色。只是真没想到生死比试会选在这种地方进行。¤The mountains are beautiful, the view is unobstructed, a great view. I just didn't expect the life and death competition to be held in such a place.
初次见面，不清楚你的实力，所以我不会留手。¤The first time we meet, we don't know your strength, so I won't hold back.
...见过会长。¤... Well met Chairman.
好，比试也差不多该开始了，下面就按规矩，请代表唐家和长老堂出战的两位道友上场吧。¤Okay, it's almost time for the competition to begin, so let's follow the rules and invite the two Daoists representing the Tang Family and the Hall of Elders to take the stage.
我并不反对唐家对我发起挑战，但无论今日比试胜负如何，我必须提醒诸位，仔细想一想什么才是我们商会的立足之本。¤I have no objection to the Tang Family challenging me, but no matter how we win or lose today's competition, I must remind you all to think carefully about what is the foundation of our Merchant Guild.
吴长老，我们到了。¤Elder Wu, we are here.
既然你会被吴家选中，想必有些本事，日后由我们唐家主管商会，也会重用你这样的人。早些认输，我会尽量保你不死。¤Since you will be chosen by the Wu family, you must have some skills, and in the future by our Tang family in charge of the Merchant Guild, will also reuse people like you. Admit defeat early and I will try to keep you from dying.
吴会长，这些话就留到比试结束以后再说吧。¤Chairman Wu, let's save these words for after the competition is over.
哈哈哈，{FirstName}供奉。来这里少坐片刻，我已派人通知唐家，想必他们很快便到。¤Hahahaha, guest elder {FirstName}. Come here to sit for a few moments, I have sent someone to notify the Tang family, I think they will soon arrive.
吴四海，你若是手痒，我来做你的对手。不过今日是小辈间的比试，咱们这些长老堂的老骨头们就别凑这个热闹了。¤Wu Sihai, if your hands are itching, I'll be your opponent. But today is the competition between the juniors, we elders Hall of the old bones do not join the fun.
你暗自凝聚一道神识向唐平刺去，只见那唐平霎时间面色铁青，一个踉跄险些跌倒在地，神色惊恐的望着你。¤You secretly condensed a soul sense to Tang Ping stabbed, only to see that Tang Ping suddenly face blue, a stagger nearly fell to the ground, looking at you with a frightened look.
见过会长。¤Well met Chairman.
你闭目养神，并不理睬此人的挑衅。那唐平自感无趣，冷哼一声，也不再说什么了。¤You close your eyes and ignore this person's provocation. That Tang Ping felt bored with himself, coldly snorted, and no longer said anything.
好了诸位，口舌之争便免去了吧。既然人已到齐，那么我就先说几句。¤Well gentlemen, the verbal arguments will be dispensed with. Since people have arrived, I will say a few words first.
不错，生死比试历来是我们碎星商会革新与传承的手段。人的寿元终究有限，早晚有一日，坐在我们现在位置上的会是这些小辈。¤It's true, life and death competitions have always been a means of innovation and heritage for our Shattered Star Chamber. The life span of a person is ultimately limited, and sooner or later, it will be these juniors who will sit in our current position.
四海兄，看来这位道友便是你新找来的帮手吧。能让你看上的，想必修为不俗，这次的比试我可是很期待哟。¤The newest and most important thing that you can do is to find a new helper. I'm looking forward to this competition.
这生死比试的规矩，是当年百里家的前辈定下的。想要在无尽之海上生存，最有效的永远是力量，商会不可能交给软弱之人掌控。¤The rules of this life and death competition were set by the predecessors of the Baili family back then. Want to survive in the endless sea, the most effective is always power, the Merchant Guild can not be given to weak people to control.
我们碎星商会创建之初，只不过是这无尽之海上极为不起眼的一个小商会罢了。当年靠着百里家与我们吴家数代人的努力，才慢慢发展壮大。但若是没有后来唐家与白家的加入，我们定然不可能成为这广阔海域上最大的商会组织。¤Our broken star Merchant Guild was created, but is this endless sea is extremely insignificant a small Merchant Guild. When relying on the efforts of the Baili family and our Wu family for several generations, only slowly developed and grew. But without the later Tang family and the Bai family to join, we certainly can not become the largest Merchant Guild organization on the vast sea.
噢？这位道友倒是面生的很，怎么，吴四海，这就是你找来的救兵？看来你们吴家的那些小辈们是一个拿得出手的也没有啊。¤Oh? This fellow Daoist is quite a familiar face. What, Wu Sihai, this is the rescue you found? It seems that the juniors of your Wu family are none of them.
你暗自凝聚一道神识向唐平刺去，却不料他似早有准备一般，将你的攻击弹了回来。¤You secretly gathered a soul sense to stab at Tang Ping, but unexpectedly he seemed to be prepared and bounced your attack back.
见你出言反驳，唐平冷哼一声，也不再多说什么了。¤Seeing you speak back, Tang Ping snorted coldly and said nothing more.
你闷哼一声，没想到此人修为如此高深，只是暗中的角力便已让你吃了大亏。¤You stifled a grunt, did not expect this person's cultivation is so profound, just a secret wrestling has let you eat a big loss.
那唐平瞥了你一眼，言语讥讽，你决定...？¤That Tang Ping glanced at you, words sneered, you decided...?
白长老可真是无事一身轻啊，可惜比试规定长老会的成员不得亲自参加，否则老夫倒是想亲自会会那唐家小辈。¤White elder can really nothing to do ah, it is a pity that the competition rules that members of the Elders Council may not personally participate, otherwise the old man would like to personally meet that Tang family juniors.
到底是谁送死可不一定，一切用实力说话，我劝道友还是不要太早下结论的好。¤In the end, it is not certain who will die, everything speaks with strength, I advise you not to jump to conclusions too early.
{xiaozi}，我不清楚那吴四海给你许诺了什么报酬，不过，我劝你还是不要趟这趟浑水，白白送死的好。¤{xiaozi}, I'm not sure what kind of reward that Wu Sihai has promised you, but I advise you not to take this trip and die for nothing.
（抓散修...莫非广陵城那位道友的大哥失踪便与此人有关？）¤(Catch an independent cultivator... Could it be that the disappearance of the fellow Daoist brothers in Guangling City is related to this person?)
没想到此番去抓的那几个{color=#d0380a}散修{/color}倒有几分本事...这次元气大伤，怕是要好好调息一段时间了。¤I didn't expect the target {color=#d0380a}independent cultivators{/color} to be this good... I'm badly injured this time, and I am afraid that I will have to take a break for a long while.
正当你懊悔自己跟丢了人时，只听背后传来幽幽冷笑声...¤Just when you regretted that you were ashamed, you only heard a faint sneer from behind...
（不管了，先把他制住了再问也不迟！）¤(It doesn't matter, it's not too late to stop him first!)
哼，都怪那老家伙过分小心，不让我{color=#d0380a}暴露功法{/color}。要不然何至于被这几个散修伤到...¤Huh, it's the geezer fault for being too careful and not letting me {color=#d0380a}reveal my techniques{/color}. Otherwise, I would never be injured by those independent cultivators...
你偷偷跟着他走了一段时间，只见他速度忽快忽慢，七转八扭之间竟不见了踪影。¤You followed him secretly for a while, only to see that he was fast and slow, and disappeared between seven turns and eight twists.
下辈子少管这种闲事，你还能活的久一点。¤Don't worry about this nosy in your next life, you can live longer.
（此人一看便不是什么善与之辈，还是别蹚这趟浑水了...）¤(This person is not a good person at first sight, so don't take this muddy water...)
刚刚突破到金丹期的嗜焰蟒王实力太强了，无论是力量，速度还是施展法门的威力都远胜于你。好在你对于火之道感悟颇深，这才能够勉力支撑到现在。¤The flame-thirsty python king who just broke into the Golden Core Stage is too strong. Whether it is power, speed, or the power of casting spells, it is far better than you. Fortunately, you have a deep understanding of the way of fire, so you can barely support it. right now.
低沉的嘶鸣，嗜焰蟒王被你触怒了，它没有想到刚刚突破到金丹期的自己，竟会被一个筑基期的人类困住。¤With a deep neigh, the Flame-thirsty Python King was offended by you. It didn't expect that it would be trapped by a human in the foundation-building period when it had just broken through the Golden Core Phase.
一次，两次...你的精神高度集中，尝试用各种方法破解火蛇的攻势。慢慢的，你似乎找到了其中窍门，同样开始尝试操控周天密布的火灵气进行反击。¤Once, twice... you are highly concentrated, trying to crack the Fire Serpent's offensive in various ways. Slowly, you seem to have found the trick, and you also start to try to control the fire aura that is densely covered by the sky to counterattack.
而嗜焰蟒王似乎并不准备马上杀了你，反而像是把你当成了某种有趣的玩具一般戏耍。它不断喷吐出蛇形的灵气火焰攻击你，而你也只能疲于应对。¤And the flame-thirsty python doesn't seem to be ready to kill you right away. Instead, it seems to play you like some kind of fun toy. It constantly spews out serpentine aura flames to attack you, and you can only cope with it. .
你被一团炙热的火蛇紧紧围住，难以挣脱。¤You are tightly surrounded by a scorching fire snake, it is difficult to break free.
你大笑着离开了这里，背后传来蛇王不甘的低吼。¤You left here with a big laugh, and the Snake King's unwilling roar came from behind.
以你对于火之道的感悟，学会更高难度的火焰操控技巧只是时间问题，而嗜焰蟒王给你带来的巨大压力正好令你跨出了那一步。¤Based on your perception of the way of fire, it is only a matter of time before you learn more difficult fire control skills, and the tremendous pressure that the Flame-Hungry Python brings to you just makes you take that step.
另一条巨大的火蛇凭空出现，一口将周围的小蛇吞噬干净，然后将嗜焰蟒王硕大的蛇头紧紧缠住。¤Another huge fire snake appeared out of thin air, swallowing up the surrounding little snakes in one bite, and then tightly entangled the huge snake head of the flame-thirsty python king.
嗜焰蟒王不甘地低吼了一声，它没有想到刚刚突破到金丹期的自己，竟会被一个炼气期的人类击败。硕大的身躯跌落在地上，百余年的修为毁于一旦。¤The Flame-Thirsty Python King roared low in reluctance, it did not expect that it would be defeated by a human at the Qi Refining stage, having just broken through to the Golden Dan stage. Its huge body fell to the ground, and its cultivation of over a hundred years was destroyed.
领悟神通：{color=#d0380a}火蛇术{/color}¤Understanding magical powers: {color=#d0380a}fire snake technique{/color}
哈哈哈哈，今天就打到这，嗜焰蟒王，多谢你助我突破！¤Hahahaha, I'll be here today, Flame Python King, thank you for helping me break through!
嗜焰蟒王不甘地低吼了一声，它没有想到刚刚突破到金丹期的自己，竟会被一个筑基期的人类击败。硕大的身躯跌落在地上，百余年的修为毁于一旦。¤The flame-thirsty python roared unwillingly. It did not expect that it had just broken into the Golden Core Stage and would be defeated by a human being in the Foundation-Building Stage. The huge body fell to the ground, and the cultivation base of more than 100 years was destroyed. .
道友，找我何事？¤Daoist, what are you looking for?
道友此事十万火急，还望道友速速行事。¤Fellow Daoists are very anxious about this matter, and I hope fellow Daoists will act quickly.
道友我龙族正直多事之秋。¤Fellow Daoist, my dragon family is upright and troubled.
{FirstName}供奉飞升如此盛事，我龙族自然不会错过。届时我与兄长定会前来为{FirstName}供奉护法。¤Guest elder {FirstName}'s ascension is such a great event that my dragon clan will not miss it. My brother and I will definitely come to guard Guest elder {FirstName}.
不错，不错，丹药的品质上乘，这些灵石是给你的报酬。¤Yes, yes, the pill is of high quality, and these spirit stones are rewards for you.
我们灵药堂的炼丹房当然不会随便对外开放，不过稍稍花些钱，便可以在白帝楼租借到一间地火房，倒也不算麻烦。¤Of course, the alchemy room in our Spirit Herb Hall will not be open to the public casually, but for a little bit of money, you can rent a ground fire room in the Baidi Building, which is not too much trouble.
这不同的药材之间，药性自然不同。但即便是同一种草药，在炼丹时作为主药，辅药或是药引使用，功效也大有差别。¤The medicinal properties of these different medicinal materials are naturally different. But even if the same herbal medicine is used as a main medicine, auxiliary medicine or a medicinal ingredient in alchemy, the efficacy is quite different.
不过若是没有丹方，那就得自行鉴别药材，调整配方，再中和药性...这可就是一门学问了。¤But if there is no pill, you have to identify the medicinal materials, adjust the formula, and then neutralize the properties of the medicine... This is a science.
教嘛倒也谈不上，这炼丹本来也不是什么难事。¤I can't talk about teaching, this alchemy is not difficult at all.
你也会炼制丹药？¤You can also refine pills?
眼下我们的库存的确略有不足，因此{$Var}¤At the moment our inventory is indeed slightly insufficient, so {$Var}
有经验的炼丹师，只需要自己动手炼制一次药材，就可以从药渣中鉴别出它独特的药性。¤Experienced alchemists only need to refine the medicinal materials once by themselves, and then they can identify its unique medicinal properties from the dregs.
我这里正好还有一副“生骨丹”的丹方，倒也不值什么钱，便一起送给你好了。¤I also happen to have a recipe for Minor Healing Pills here, it's not worth much, so I'll add it as a bonus.
就比如咱们宁州最常见的流莹草，作为主药使用可“生息”，作为辅药使用可“培元”。同时，作为一味“性热”的药草，它也可以作为药引，中和其他“性寒”的草药。¤For example, the most common Ebbglow Stalk in Ning Province, used as a main ingredient has a nascent property, and used as an secondary ingrediant have an Enforcing property. At the same time, as a herb that has a heat aspect, it can also be used as to harmonize other cold-aspect herbs.
这种丹药的话...我炼制起来也颇有难度。¤With this kind of pill... it's quite difficult for me to refine it.
我们灵药堂愿意以{$jiangli}的价格收购这批丹药。¤We Spirit Herb Hall is willing to purchase these pills at the price of {$jiangli}.
若是强行用低品阶的丹炉炼制高品阶的丹药，甚至会有炸炉的风险！¤If you forcibly use a low-grade pill furnace to refine a high-grade pill, you may even risk frying!
这丹药的品阶越高越难炼制，这丹方的价格自然也是水涨船高，一些稀有的丹方甚至可以在拍卖会上拍出数万灵石的高价。¤The higher the grade of this pill, the more difficult it is to refine. The price of this pill is naturally rising. Some rare pill can even be sold at auction for tens of thousands of spiritual stones.
若是你也能炼成符合我们品质要求的丹药来，我可以用比市场价略高一筹的价格从你这里收购。¤If you can also refine the pill that meets our quality requirements, I can buy it from you at a price slightly higher than the market price.
这炼丹场地倒也颇有讲究，一般的房间可经受不住“地火”的炙烤。¤This alchemy site is also quite particular, and ordinary rooms can't stand the ground fire.
炼丹用的丹炉也分品阶，高品质的丹炉更耐用，也能够承受更多的药力。¤Pill furnaces used for alchemy are also classified into different grades. High-quality pill furnaces are more durable and can withstand more medicinal power.
托你炼制的丹药你可带来了？¤Did you bring the pill that you refined?
（上下打量）你一个才刚踏入炼气期的{xiaozi}能炼出什么好丹药来？别在这里捣乱了。¤(Looking up and down) What kind of pill can you make from a {xiaozi} who has just stepped into the Qi refining period? Don't make trouble here.
不过光咱们宁州常见的草药便数不胜数，何况还有各种稀有的海外仙草，药性各不相同，恐怕最有经验的炼丹师也没办法鉴别出所有药材功效来。¤However, there are countless common herbs in Ning Province alone. Besides, there are various rare overseas immortal herbs with different medicinal properties. I am afraid that the most experienced alchemist can't identify the effects of all the medicinal materials.
不过若只是炼制常见的基础丹药，丹药不妨去{color=#d0380a}天星城{/color}看看，他们那里不仅出售神通术法也出售各类丹方。¤However, if you are just refining common basic medicine pills, you might as well go to {color=#d0380a}Sky Star City{/color} to have a look. They not only sell magical powers, but also all kinds of pill recipes.
你刚开始学习炼丹，倒是用不上什么太好的炉子。像这种普通的一品丹炉，出个400灵石拿去便是。¤You just started to learn alchemy, but you don't need a great stove. Just like this ordinary first-grade alchemy stove, you can get a 400 spirit stone and take it.
而且若是熟知药理，又精通药性的鉴别，即便没有丹方，也未必不能自己摸索炼制出丹药来。¤Moreover, if you are familiar with pharmacology and are proficient in the identification of medicinal properties, even if you do not have medicinal herbs, you may not be able to explore and refine medicinal medicinal herbs by yourself.
我们灵药堂向来有自己的炼丹大师，不过偶尔也确实会因为某些草药短缺而库存不足。¤We Spirit Herb Hall has always had its own alchemy master, but occasionally, it does happen that the inventory is insufficient due to the shortage of certain herbs.
我们灵药堂近日货存充足，没有什么需要补充的丹药。¤We Spirit Herb Hall have been in sufficient stock recently, and there is no need to replenish the medicine.
没钱？那我可不能白送你。¤No money? Then I can't give you away for free.
备齐了药材，再配上一个高品质的丹炉，按着丹方一步步走，任谁都能炼出一炉上好的丹药来。¤When you have all the medicinal materials, you can equip it with a high-quality pill furnace, and follow the pill recipe step by step. Anyone can make a good pill.
琚长老，你再不出手，我可就撑不住了。¤Elder Ju, if you don't step in, I won't be able to hold out much longer.
赤目老祖狂性大发，不再管你，而是扭身与琚运琦战做一团。¤The red-eyed old man goes berserk and no longer cares about you, but twists around and battles Ju Yunqi.
琚运琦怎么了？是谁告诉你我的行踪的？¤What happened to Ju Yunqi? Who told you about my whereabouts?
琚运琦？是他让你来的？¤Ju Yunqi? Did he send you here?
他虽然身负重伤，但如此不要命的打法却让琚运琦一时之间也不敢用强。¤Although he was badly injured, such a desperate fighting style made Ju Yunqi not dare to use force for a while.
琚长老？¤Elder Ju?
琚运琦，你机关算尽，不惜背信弃义也要除掉我，最后也没能保住你那点小秘密，真是可笑。¤Ju Yunqi, you have done everything you can to get rid of me even at the expense of betraying your trust, but in the end you failed to keep your little secret, how ridiculous.
九幽刺...¤The Nine Spectral Stings...
你正在考虑要不要出手，远处却传来一个熟悉的声音。¤You are considering whether to make a move when a familiar voice comes from the distance.
哈哈哈哈哈，就你这点本事，也想杀我？¤Hahahahahahaha, how can you even think of killing me with this ability?
琚运琦没有理睬赤目老祖，而是面色铁青的看着公孙季。¤Ju Yunqi ignored the red-eyed old ancestor and instead looked at Gongsun Ji with a grimace.
风雨楼的人都来齐了？琚运琦！杀了我对你有什么好处？¤Everyone from Storm Manor is here? Ju Yunqi! What good will it do you to kill me?
别忘了...当年可是我助你坐上了这大长老的位置！¤Don't forget... I was the one who helped you to take the position of Grand Elder back then!
哈哈哈，多亏了琚长老的计谋，我们才能抓住这条大鱼。¤Hahahaha, thanks to Elder Ju's ploy, we were able to catch this big fish.
赤目老祖与琚运琦二人分别化作一道血色与紫色的遁光，向着不同的方向逃去...¤The Red-eyed Ancestor and Ju Yunqi both turned into a blood-coloured and purple vanish light respectively, fleeing in different directions...
一道紫光突然闪过，穿破赤目老祖身边的血色剑气，将他的肩膀捅了个对穿。一时间赤目老祖血流不止，本就泛着红光的眼眸愈发狰狞起来。¤A flash of purple light suddenly pierced through the blood-coloured Sword Qi around the Red-eyed Old Ancestor, stabbing him right through the shoulder. In a flash, the blood flowed out of the Red-Eyed Old Ancestor's eyes, which were already glowing red, became more and more fierce.
赤目老祖，还想活着离开的话，不如你我最后再合作一次，如何？¤Old Man Red Eye, if you still want to leave alive, how about you and I work together one last time?
{$daihao}，你还不出手？¤{$daihao}, you're still not out?
琚运琦...你竟敢...¤Ju Yunqi... How dare you...
好...好...好！¤Well... Good... Yes!
当年公孙璞都没能要了我的命，你这点微末道行，和他还差的远了。¤Back then, even Gongsun Pu failed to kill me, so you're not even close to him with this modest Daoist skill.
也？阿焰连你都被他们耍了？嘎嘎嘎~啊¤Too? Flame even you are fooled by them? Gahhhhh~ ah
咕~¤Goo~
{shidi}也失手了？¤Did {shidi} miss too?
具体的情况，我还没问几句就触发了什么禁制，他就直接气绝了¤The specifics of the situation, before I could ask a few questions about what prohibitions were triggered, he simply ran out of breath
（元婴期大妖一下就是两只。）¤(There are two YuanYing stage great demons at once.)
（没等你开口）¤(without waiting for you to say anything)
你就是{FirstName}{LastName}吧，阿焰让我们在这里等你。¤You are {FirstName}{LastName}, right? Flame asked us to wait for you here.
据传闻年{$year}前，古神教觊觎这炼丹之法，他们难以抵挡就逃亡宁州了。当时还是化尘教处理的此事。¤According to rumors, years {$year} ago, the Ancient God Sect coveted this method of alchemy, and they fled Ning Province when they could hardly resist. At that time, it was the Dust Transformation Cult that handled the matter.
钟焰面露厌恶之色。¤Bellflame's face was disgusted.
呦~你就是{FirstName}{LastName}吧，阿焰让我们在这里等你。¤Yo~ you are {FirstName}{LastName}, right? Flame told us to wait for you here.
此时，钟焰面色凝重的走了进来。¤At this moment, Zhong Yan walked in with a stony face.
你连我都不知道？我乃是炎麟大圣~~~¤You don't even know me? I am the Great Sage of Yan Lin~~~
你呀就是口无遮拦，就不怕炎师弟拔光你的鸟毛？¤Are you afraid that Brother Yan will pull out your hair?
看什么看，没见过帅哥啊。¤What are you looking at? You've never seen a handsome man before.
一只鹤站在一只火蟾的头上，你们的目光在半空中交汇了。¤A crane stands on the head of a fire toad and your eyes meet in mid-air.
看你空手而归，莫不是事情办砸了？¤You came back empty-handed, did you fail to get things done?
你讲所见所闻如实告知。¤You tell the truth about what you have seen and heard.
我擒下一人，自称是玄古门门下。¤I captured a man who claimed to be a member of the Profound Ancient Sect.
{xiaozi}，可是找到了那豹麟兽？¤{xiaozi}, but did you find the leopard-lin beast?
钟焰并不在此地。不过早有别“人”在等你。¤The Bell Flame is not here. But there is someone else waiting for you.
的灵兽。你可以叫我炎鹤大人，他是天蟾子。阿焰有事缠身，就拜托我们在此等你。¤The spirit animal. You can call me Lord Yan Crane, he is the Toad of Heaven. Flame is busy, so he asked us to wait for you.
嘶~衡州？他们和古神教那帮王八蛋什么关系啊？¤Hiss~ Hengzhou? What's their relationship with those bastards of the Ancient God Sect?
这玄古门本是衡州的小宗门，不过门下精善炼药也小有名气，不过...¤This Profound Ancient Sect was originally a small sect in Hengzhou, but it was also famous for its skill in refining medicine, but...
嘶~恒火这傻子干什么吃的，他竟没有察觉么。¤Hiss~ What did this fool Heng Huo eat, did he not even notice?
算了，此事本就是我私人委托。{shidi}已经尽力了，不必放在心上。¤Forget it, this is a personal commission for me. {I've done my best, so don't take it to heart.
这两块赤火元铜是我自己的的收藏，就赠予{shidi}了。¤These two pieces of red-hot metacopper are from my own collection and are presented to {shidi}.
钟焰挥手击落站在蛤蟆头顶的炎鹤。¤Bellflame swung his hand to strike down the Inferno Crane standing atop the toad's head.
他们的炼丹之法多有以妖族血肉入药的法子，虽不似天魔道那班疯子，却也称不上是正道修士。¤Their alchemy methods mostly involve using demon flesh and blood as medicine. Although they are not like the madmen of the Heavenly Demon Dao, they are not considered proper cultivators either.
还未请教，你是？¤Not yet asked, you are?
玄古门？没听说啊。¤The Profound Ancient Sect? Never heard of it.
（睁开眼）咕~¤(Opens eyes) Coo~
既然知道自己的实力还有不足，就更要好好修炼。凭你现在这点修为，还没有资格学习为师的绝学。¤Since you know that your strength is still insufficient, you have to practice hard. With your current level of cultivation, you are not yet qualified to learn to be a teacher.
在师尊的点拨之下，你又有了新的感悟。¤Under the guidance of the master, you have a new insight.
为师的这门绝学可不是那么容易就能学会的，你现在修为到底如何，就让为师来考教一番吧。¤The mastery of being a teacher is not so easy to learn. What is your current level of cultivation? Let the teacher come to test and teach it.
为师此次给你两个月的时间，就让我看看你这段时间的修炼成果吧。¤The teacher will give you two months this time, let me see the results of your cultivation during this time.
你且听好...¤Listen carefully...
贪多嚼不烂，为师也只能传授你一部分的经验见解，悟道修行最终还是得看你自己的悟性与仙缘。¤You are too greedy to chew, and being a teacher can only teach you a part of your experience and insights. In the end, you still have to see your own understanding and immortality.
今日来找为师何事？¤Why come to be a teacher today?
过段时间再来吧。¤Come back later.
哈哈哈...不错不错，你果然没有让为师失望。¤Hahaha... not bad, you didn't disappoint you as a teacher.
若你能战胜为师，那便代表你已经有了足够的实力，为师也可以放心地把师门绝学传授于你，相信你不会辱没了师门威名。¤If you can overcome being a teacher, then it means that you have enough strength. As a teacher, you can safely teach you the mastery of the teacher. I believe you will not shame the reputation of the teacher.
多谢师尊¤Thank you, Master
为师的这门绝学可不是那么容易就能学会的，你如今修为尚浅，等你至少突破到{color=#d0380a}筑基中期{/color}以后再来吧。¤The mastery of being a teacher is not so easy to learn. Your cultivation level is still shallow now, wait until you at least break through to the {color=#d0380a} mid-foundation stage{/color}.
接下来便是你出师前最后的考验了，为师会将自身修为压制与你切磋一番。¤The next step is the final test before you leave the teacher. The teacher will suppress your cultivation base and discuss it with you.
很好，看来你对自己的实力很有信心，希望你不要让为师失望。¤Very well, it seems that you have confidence in your own strength, and I hope you will not let down as a teacher.
“轰！”{vpunch=10,0.5}¤'Boom!'' {vpunch=10,0.5}
你的识海猛的一阵轰鸣，一道阴冷的神识突然锁定了你。¤Your sea of consciousness roars violently, and a cold soul sense suddenly locks onto you.
我说天机阁为何要设在这地方，倒还真是个风水宝地。¤I said why the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion is located in this place, but it is really a feng shui treasure.
与总管告别后，你们一同前往天机阁四周游玩了一番。¤After saying goodbye to the chief steward, you went together to tour around the Heavens Secrets Pavilion.
但见绿树青山，层峦叠嶂，这壮阔又不失清秀的美景被你二人尽收眼底。¤But see the green trees and green mountains, the layers of mountains, this magnificent and yet beautiful scenery was captured by you two.
好，我也回客房休息了。到时候你在擂台上，我一定给你加油助威！¤Okay, I'm also going back to the guest room to rest. When you are in the ring, I will cheer you on!
好，我们到时候见~¤Okay, I'll see you there~
今日一游确是意犹未尽，不过现在天色已晚，我们且回去休息罢。¤Today's trip is really not enough, but now it's late, and we go back to rest.
倪兄所言极是。¤What brother Ni said is very true.
今日一游确是意犹未尽，不过现在天色已晚，我也需回去准备一番，我们明日再会吧。¤Today's trip is really not enough, but now it's late, I also need to go back to prepare, we will meet again tomorrow.
不觉间，竟已是傍晚时分。¤I didn't realize that it was already evening.
我们鳞皮行专售各类妖兽鳞片，外皮类材料。道友看看有什么需要的？¤Our scale skin shop specializes in selling all kinds of monster scales and skin materials. Fellow Daoists, what do you need?
真是好茶！那还麻烦前辈替我谢谢家主前辈和倪道友了。¤What a great tea! Then I would also like to ask senior to thank the family head senior and Daoist Ni for me.
不错，这倪家还真算是客气周到，有了这些灵石，也能让你轻松一段日子了。¤Not bad, this Ni family is really polite and considerate, with these spirit stones, it will be easy for you for a while.
宴上的意外...实在是不好意思，绝非我倪家本意。家主少主他们可担心坏了。少爷还亲自为你开炉炼了丹药...咳咳，你还是别试的好。¤The accident at the banquet... I'm really sorry, it was never the intention of my Ni family. The young master and his family were extremely worried. The young master even personally opened the furnace and made the potion for you... Ahem, it's better if you don't try it.
对了，这个呢，则是我倪家的一点心意，你不必客气，收下便是，希望能成为你修炼路上的一份助力。¤This is a small token of appreciation from the Ni family, so you don't have to be polite and accept it.
前辈哪里话，我是晚辈，待哪日家主前辈得闲归来，我再来府上亲自拜访才是。¤I am a junior, and I will come back to the house to pay a personal visit when the family head returns one day.
若能{color=#d0380a}拜入修真大派{/color}，自然能少走不少的弯路。但凡大宗门传承的神通功法，皆有其独到玄妙之处。¤If you can {color=#d0380a}join a Great School of Cultivation{/color}, you will naturally be able to avoid many detours. But know this, every Great Sect also teaches their own unique and profound powers.
门开了，一位家仆捧着一盏灵茶向你慢步走来，后面跟着一位精神矍铄的老者。¤The door opens and a house servant walks slowly towards you with a cup of spiritual tea, followed by a hale and hearty old man.
莫欺少年穷，我一定会触摸到这个世界的顶端！¤Don't bully young people, I will definitely reach the top of this world!
仙途漫漫，危机四伏，稍不留意便会身死道消。你最能信赖的，就只有自己的实力罢了。¤The journey to immortality is long and full of crises, and if you are not careful, you will die. The only thing you can rely on is your own strength.
可惜...我本就不精于这些事情，如今又失去了大半记忆，想要在这些方面有所成就，就只能靠你自身的机缘了。¤Unfortunately... I was not adept at these things, and now that I have lost most of my memory, I will have to rely on your own chance to achieve something in these areas.
再次睁开眼，你已身在客房之中。枕边的锈剑斑驳依旧，平平无奇。只有满口的酒气和空洞的丹田，让你明白这并非一场梦。¤When you open your eyes again, you are in the guest room. The rusty sword on your pillow is still dappled and plain. Only the smell of wine on your breath and the hollowness of your dantian make you realise that this was not a dream.
你轻抿了一口，只觉得清香袭人，如登仙境，不禁咕咚咚一饮而尽。感到神清气爽，心境通明。¤When you take a sip, you feel like you're in a fairyland, so you can't help but drink it all in one gulp. You feel refreshed and clear-headed.
修真界以强者为尊，想要摆脱这种人为刀俎我为鱼肉的情况，你要走的路可还长着。¤In the cultivation world, the strongest person is the most important, to get rid of this situation where people are the sacrificial lamb, you still have a long way to go.
那咱们也得识相一些，别待太久，尽快离开吧。走之前最好去{color=#d0380a}大厅{/color}和管家打个招呼，打听打听。¤Then we need to be sensible and not stay too long, so let's leave as soon as possible. Better go to {color=#d0380a}the hall{/color}and say hello to the steward and ask around before you go.
门派内的修炼资源较多，而且其中见多识广的长老师兄也会传授你一些经验教训。¤There are more training resources in the Sect, as well as well-versed Elders and Senior brothers who are willing to nurture and guide you.
哈哈哈，好！你若有什么想知道的，随时可以来倪府大厅找我，我自当知无不言，言无不尽。¤Hahahaha, good! If there is anything you want to know, feel free to come to me at the Ni House Hall and I will tell you everything I know and say.
哈哈哈，你有这份志气便可达成夙愿。¤Hahaha, you can fulfill your long-cherished wish if you have this ambition.
同阶修士间的争斗，修为并不是最重要的。若是{color=#d0380a}功法{/color}，{color=#d0380a}神通{/color}掌握的熟练，又有趁手的{color=#d0380a}法器{/color}辅助，面对修为比你高深的对手也不是没有一战之力。¤In a fight between cultivators of the same class, cultivation is not the most important. If it is {color=#d0380a}gong method{/color}, {color=#d0380a} magical powers{/color} have the proficiency, and have the advantage of { color=#d0380a}The magic weapon{/color} , you can win against opponents whose cultivation base is higher than yours.
不错，心性可嘉。¤Not bad, a worthy temperament.
不错，小友举止不俗，恭敬有礼，将来必成大器。¤Not bad, you have a good demeanour, respectful and courteous, you will become a great asset in the future.
小友好好休息，老夫还有公务需要处理，就先行告辞了。从今往后，我倪府你自可随意出入。¤I have some business to attend to, so I will take my leave. From now on, you are free to come and go from my house.
大道三千，殊途同归，个人自有个人的机缘。¤Three thousand avenues, yet all these different routes inevitably lead to the same destination, every individual must seize their own opportunity.
不错，{xiaozi}，收拾一下，咱们离开这里.....等等，有人来了。¤Nice, {xiaozi}, pack it up and let's get out of here ..... Wait, someone's coming.
小友你终于醒了，可还有什么不舒服的地方？¤You are finally awake, are you still uncomfortable?
手中的宝剑瞬间安静下来，没有一丝灵力波动，像极了一把普通老旧的铁剑。¤The sword in his hand was instantly silent, without a single fluctuation of spiritual energy, like a plain old iron sword.
但也不是说散修就不能成就一番作为，无拘无束，只凭自己的本心求道，自会遇到属于你的机缘奇遇。只是会{color=#d0380a}困难非常{/color}罢了，你要仔细斟酌。¤But that's not to say that a independent cultivator can't achieve something. If you seek the path without restraint and with your own heart, you'll encounter your own chance of a miraculous encounter. It will just be {color=#d0380a}very difficult{/color}, so you should consider it carefully.
哈哈哈，小友喝慢点、喝慢点...这茶可不常有，是少爷珍藏的，非要我给你沏了送来。¤Hahahaha, take it easy, young friend... This tea is not often available, the young master treasured it and asked me to bring it to you.
虽然那倪家主并无恶意，但想起那令自己动弹不得的凌厉剑意，你还是不经有些后怕...这次若非自己运气好，此时恐怕早已身首异处！¤Although Patriarch Ni is not malicious, but when you think of the fierce sword intent that makes you unable to move, you are still a little scared... If it wasn't for your luck this time, I'm afraid you would have been in a different place by now!
多谢前辈关心，我已经没有什么大碍了。¤Thank you for your concern, I am no longer in any serious condition.
除了修炼以外，还有炼丹、炼器、布阵等等的技巧，皆可成道。¤In addition to cultivation, there are also skills such as alchemy, weapon refining, and formation, etc., all of which can become enlightened.
你恭敬地接过灵茶，只见碧叶点点，灵气飘飘，一看便不是凡物。¤You respectfully accept the tea and see that the leaves are dotted and the aura floats, so it is no ordinary thing at first glance.
你向倪府管家深施一礼。老者笑了笑，示意不必多礼，便悠然离去。¤You give a deep bow to the Ni House steward. The old man smiled, signalling that there was no need to be polite, and left at a leisurely pace.
家主有要事已经出城，少主在阁中闭关修炼，不便与你相见，有失礼数，小友莫怪。¤The head of the family has left town on important business, and the young master is in the pavilion in seclusion, so it is not convenient to meet with you.
这个世界本就由强者和弱者组成，但我不会永远停步在弱者的行列。¤This world is made up of the strong and the weak, but I will not stop in the ranks of the weak forever.
倪府管家郑重地递给你一个鼓鼓囊囊的储物袋，你神识一探，里面足有一千五百灵石。¤The House of Ni butler solemnly hands you a bulging storage bag, and when your soul sense peeks inside, there are 1,500 spirit stones.
你努力撑起酸痛的身体，倚坐在灵榻上，摸了摸脖子，摸了摸心口，抚摩着锈渍铁剑，长舒了一口气。¤You struggle to hold up your aching body and lean back on the spirit couch, touching your neck, feeling your heart, stroking the rust-stained iron sword and breathing a long sigh of relief.
相反，若只是闭门枯坐，没有任何临战经验，那修炼百年也不过是空有一身无用的修为，真要遇到危险可就束手无策了。¤On the contrary, if you just sit behind closed doors and don't have any experience in battle, then a hundred years of cultivation will be nothing but a useless cultivation base. If you really encounter danger, you will be helpless.
请快快用些茶吧，此茶有解酒提神之效。喝下应该会舒服一些。¤Please use some tea quickly. This tea has the effect of relieving alcohol and refreshing the mind. Drink it and you should feel better.
有心无力的滋味怎么样，{xiaozi}？¤How does it feel to feel helpless, {xiaozi}?
场上刹时风云变幻，转眼之间老者又出现在了正与麒麟近身相搏的红莲身后。¤In a flash the field changed and in the blink of an eye the old man reappeared behind Red Lotus who was fighting the Qilin at close quarters.
无知...¤Ignorance...
人类修士...至多不过千余年寿元。化神大妖...也不过活数万年。¤Human cultivators... At most, they will only live for a thousand years or so. A Deity Transformation beast... They will only live for tens of thousands of years.
夺下两柄魔剑的恶饕老祖也愈发疯狂，不顾身后追来的正魔两道化神，直直的便又朝着你冲了过来！¤The evil gourmets who took the two demonic swords became more and more frantic, ignoring the two demonic Deity Transformation coming after them, and rushed straight towards you again!
老夫苦等数万年...终于等到今天...¤I have waited for tens of thousands of years... I have finally waited for today...
今日，便是我觅得长生之日...而你们...都将死无全尸！¤Today is the day I will find eternal life... And you... You will all die without a trace!
“咕嘟...咕嘟...”¤'Gobble... Gobble...''
就在老者想要转身后撤的当口，血亢剑仙已经追了上来，身下的血剑直冲老者而去，一旁的红莲尊者也手掐法诀，一道凝实的黑气也攻向老者。¤Just as the old man tried to turn around and retreat, the Blood Hyper Sword Immortal had already caught up with him, and the blood sword beneath him went straight for the old man.
就在这众目睽睽之下，恶饕老祖竟突然消失不见了。不...应该说是他快到让人无法再捕捉到他得身影。¤Right in front of everyone's eyes, the Evil Gourmand Ancestor had suddenly disappeared. No... I should say he was so fast that people could no longer catch his silhouette.
半空之上，第八道雷劫正慢慢成型，但此时众人的焦点却都集中在这个怪物的身上。¤In mid-air, the eighth thunderbolt was slowly taking shape, but at this moment the focus of the crowd was on this monster.
粗壮的手臂之上更是伸出无数藤曼，卷着刚刚夺下的魔剑砍向血亢和红莲，将两人击退。¤The thick arms were even stretched out with countless vines that rolled around the demonic sword they had just seized and slashed at the blood hyper and red lotus, knocking them back.
今日四剑齐聚，这确实是个难得的机会。¤With the four swords gathered today, this is indeed a rare opportunity.
而在这红光之中，消失的老者显现出了身形，伸手就夺走了血亢手中的魔剑。¤And in the midst of this red light, the vanished old man manifested himself and reached out to snatch the magic sword from the hands of the blood hyper.
血亢剑仙瞬间清醒过来，闪身避开藤蔓，随即一剑刺出，正扎在恶饕老祖的胸前。¤The Blood Hyper Sword Immortal instantly came to his senses and dodged to avoid Vine Man, then stabbed his sword out, stabbing it right in the chest of the Evil Taotao Old Man.
在老者连绵不绝的攻势下，你最后的防御也被击破。魏无极急忙中再次凝聚虚影，驱使着诛仙剑挡下了一击。¤Under the old man's continuous attack, your last defence was also broken. In his haste, Wei Wuji once again gathered a virtual shadow and drove the Immortal Punishing Sword to block the blow.
刚刚还在交手的众化神也不由的把目光转移到了你们这里。¤The multitude of Deity Transformation cultivators who had just been exchanging blows could not help but turn their attention to you.
化神修士最多在下界逗留千年，这恶饕十万年前便化神了，还能活到今日？¤The most that a Deity Transformation cultivator can stay in the lower realm is a thousand years, this evil beast Taotie reached Deity Transformation stage 100,000 years ago, but is still alive today?
远处的战场上突然爆发出了剧烈的灵气波动，打断了你的思绪。¤A sudden, violent aura wave erupts from the distant battlefield, interrupting your thoughts.
四个化神后期强者神通的对撞，扰乱了整片海域的灵气，一时之间连神识探查到的景象也变得晦涩不清起来。¤The clash of the divine powers of the four late-stage Deity Transformation powerhouses disturbed the aura of the entire sea, and for a while even the scenes detected by the soul sense became obscure and unclear.
噗……老鬼你竟敢！¤Pfft ...... how dare you old geezer!
而就在这一息之间，恶饕老祖已经冲向了此前魔门与正道对峙之地，两条手臂上赫然伸出无数藤曼，卷向血亢剑仙与红莲尊者手中的魔剑。¤And in that very breath, the Evil Gourmets had already rushed towards the place where the Demon Sect had previously confronted the Righteous Way, with countless vine manners extending from both arms, curling towards the demon swords in the hands of the Blood Hyper Sword Immortal and the Red Lotus Venerable.
你就只有这点实力么？在我看来也不过如此。¤Is that all you've got? That's all you've got in my opinion.
那老鬼也不知用了什么秘术，现在即便开启领域我也未必是他的对手。¤I don't know what secret techniques that old ghost has used, but even if I open my domain now I may not be a match for him.
伴随着一阵诡异的声音，老者的一只手臂瞬间扭曲变形，膨胀了数倍的巨大手掌直接捏碎了黑气。而他的小腹处也幻化出一只麒麟兽头，一口咬碎了血剑。¤With a bizarre sound, one of the old man's arms instantly twisted and distorted, and his huge palm, which had swollen several times, directly crushed the black Qi. And a qilin beast's head also manifested at the small of his back, biting into the blood sword.
你只得收回神念，却发现本应在你身前的老者此时却不见了踪影。¤You have to withdraw your divine thoughts, only to find that the old man who should have been in front of you is nowhere to be found.
原来凌轩手上的那柄不是戮仙剑，而是失踪已久的诛仙剑。这下就有意思了...¤It turned out that the one in Ling Xuan's hand was not the Immortal Executing Sword, but the long-lost Immortal Punishing Sword. Now that's interesting...
但若能拥有上古神兽血脉...寿元便可突破十万年，甚至更久...¤But if one can possess the bloodline of an ancient divine beast... You can live beyond 100,000 years, or even longer...
没想到此人竟是恶饕。¤I had no idea that this man was a vicious gourmand.
快追！¤Get after it!
此时你的灵气早已枯竭，只能用缓慢回复的灵气勉强抵挡着老者，即使有魏无极的辅助，还是有不少的神通穿透防御击打到你的身上。¤At this point your aura has long since dried up, and you can only barely fend off the old man with your slowly recovering aura. Even with Wei Wuji's assistance, a number of divine abilities still penetrate your defences and strike your body.
他正待发力，却感觉这怪物的身体内似乎有什么东西顶住了他的剑，不由得愣了一愣。¤He was about to make his move when he felt something inside the creature's body seemingly pushing against his sword and froze.
恶饕？我记得那是古神教创教老祖吧。¤Vicious Taos? I remember that was the founding ancestor of the Ancient God Sect, right?
刚刚的煞气是...戮仙剑？¤The fierce aura just now was... Immortal Executing Sword?
今日四剑齐聚，确实是个难得的机会。¤It is indeed a rare opportunity for the four swords to come together today.
这...这到底是什么东西？¤This... What the hell is this?
一道红光闪过，浓郁的血煞之气顿时布满整片空间，即便是化神强者也不由得感到一阵晕眩。¤A red light flashed, and a dense blood-death aura immediately covered the entire space, and even the strongest of the Deity Transformation could not help but feel a whole lot of dizziness.
伴随着一阵诡异的声音，老人原本有些瘦弱的身躯迅速扩大了两圈，上身包裹着的衣物已经被撑裂，就连肤色都变成了灰暗的墨绿色。¤With an eerie sound, the old man's originally somewhat thin body rapidly expanded by two circles, the clothes wrapped around his upper body had been ripped apart and even his complexion had turned a dull greyish dark green.
血亢剑仙想要拔出魔剑，但剑却被恶饕的身体紧紧的吸住了。不得已之下，他只能松手向后闪去。¤The Blood Hyper Sword Immortal tried to pull out his magic sword, but the sword was tightly sucked in by the body of the evil gourmets. He had no choice but to release his grip and dodge backwards.
只听一声巨响，这古神教老怪最后的防御也被你的神通击破，连带着远处的小岛都在战斗的余波下支离破碎。¤Only a loud sound was heard, and the last defence of this old monster of the Ancient God Sect was shattered by your divine ability, and even the island in the distance was shattered under the aftershocks of the battle.
吼...本座怎么有种熟悉的感觉？¤Ho... Why does this seat have a familiar feeling?
吼，小贼吃我一击！¤Roar, little thief take a hit from me!
“嗖...”¤'Whoosh...''
等等...是恶饕？这老怪物竟然还没死？¤Wait a minute... It's Taotao? This old monster isn't dead yet?
不好...陷仙剑被...¤Not good... Trapped in the Sword of Immortality by...
红莲尊者一时不查，被老者从身后偷袭，正面又吃了麒麟一击，俨然已受到重创，一时之间竟无法凝聚力量反击，眼睁睁地看着手中的魔剑被老者夺下。¤He was attacked from behind by the old man and suffered a blow from the unicorn. He was so badly injured that he could not gather the strength to fight back.
在两个化神后期强者的全力攻击之下，就算这老者同是化神后期恐怕也难以全身而退。¤Under the full force of two late Deity Transformation powerhouses, even if the old man was also a late Deity Transformation powerhouse, I was afraid that he would not be able to escape with his whole body.
此时再看这老者，哪还有原来人类的模样，原本有些瘦弱的身躯膨胀开来，上身包裹着的衣物已经被撑裂，就连肤色都变成了灰暗的墨绿色，散发出恐怖的气息。¤At this moment, if you look at the old man again, there is no trace of his original human appearance, his originally somewhat thin body has swollen out, the clothes wrapped around his upper body have been burst, even his skin colour has turned a greyish dark green, giving off a terrifying aura.
咳咳...没想到...会被逼到这一步...¤Ahem... I never thought... To be pushed to this point...
不过他眼下目标必然是那柄诛仙剑，我们在一旁静观其变，待我调整好伤势后再伺机而动。¤But his immediate target is bound to be the Immortal Punishing Sword, so we will wait and see what happens until I have adjusted to my injuries and then wait for the opportunity to move.
罢了...老夫苦等了数万年...也是时候做个了结了。¤It's just that... I have waited for tens of thousands of years... It's time to bring an end to it.
嘁！¤Chit!
你的伤势越来越重，但老者的攻击的频率也越来越慢。¤Your injuries are getting worse, but the frequency of the old man's attacks is also getting slower.
原来凌轩手上的那柄不是戮仙剑，而是失踪已久的诛仙剑。¤It turned out that the one in Ling Xuan's hand was not the Immortal Executing Sword, but the long-lost Immortal Punishing Sword.
不好……¤Not good ......
难道他的灵气也快耗尽了？¤Could it be that his aura is also running out?
血亢很快就清醒了过来，但此时身前哪还有那老者的身影。¤The blood hyper quickly came to his senses, but at that moment there was no sign of the old man in front of him.
而另一边的红莲尊者更是还未来得及反应，便被夺取了手中的魔剑。¤On the other side, the Red Lotus Venerable was even taken from his hand before he had time to react, and the magic sword was taken from him.
那老鬼也不知用了什么秘术，适才与他对阵之时，我也受了些许损伤。¤I don't know what kind of secret technique that old ghost used, but when I fought against him just now, I also suffered some damage.
恰在此刻，上空的劫云又凝聚起了惊人的威势，横跨过整个天空的闪电爆发又湮灭，让四周的灵气越发紊乱。¤At that very moment, the robbery clouds overhead coalesced again with astonishing power, and the lightning that spanned the entire sky erupted and annihilated, causing the surrounding aura to become more and more disordered.
恰在此刻，正在渡劫中的白帝又凝聚起了一剑劈向劫云，劫云散开的灵气让这片海域越发紊乱。¤At that very moment, the White Emperor, who was in the middle of the tribulation, gathered another sword to slash at the tribulation cloud, which scattered the aura and made the sea more and more chaotic.
见自己的攻击再一次被诛仙剑挡下，老者却丝毫没有急着夺剑的意思，反倒是一边打量着诛仙剑，一边继续慢慢向你攻来。¤Seeing that his attack was once again blocked by the Immortal Punishing Sword, the old man did not have the slightest intention of rushing to seize the sword, but instead continued to slowly attack you while surveying the Immortal Punishing Sword.
但就在这楞神的刹那之间，恶饕老祖的小腹竟幻化出一只麒麟兽头，向着血亢持剑之手咬了上去。¤But in this moment of incoherence, a qilin's head emerged from the belly of the evil gourmand and bit into the sword-wielding hand of the blood hyper.
你凝神看去，却是麒麟与天魔道的化神强者正战斗至关键时刻。而在不远处，血亢也凝聚起了一把惊天血剑，与混元子的虚空一指撞在了一起。¤As you gaze, it is the Qilin and the Heavenly Demon Dao's Deity Transformation powerhouse fighting to a critical point. And not far away, the blood hyper also coalesced a stunning blood sword, clashing with the mixed-genius' empty finger.
是我大意了，没想到这老鬼会突然向我们发难。¤It was my carelessness, I didn't expect this old ghost to suddenly turn on us.
不过他眼下树敌太多，我们先跟上去静观其变就好。¤But he has too many enemies at the moment, so we'll just follow him and wait and see what happens.
没错，只有戮仙剑的血煞之气才能让我心神失守...¤That's right, only the blood-death aura of the Immortal Executing Sword can make me lose my mind...
正当你戒备地环视四周寻找这个老者时，却发现在血亢剑仙的面前闪过了一道红光，浓郁的血煞之气弥漫而出，即便是在稍远之处的化神强者也不由得感到一阵晕眩，血亢更是首当其冲。¤Just as you are looking around warily for this old man, you notice a red light flashing in front of the Blood Super Sword Immortal, and a dense blood-death aura pervades, even from a little distance away, and even the strongest of the Deity Transformation cannot help but feel a whole lot of dizziness, with the Blood Super bearing the brunt of it.
笑话。¤Jokes.
你们...将死无全尸。¤You... will die without a body.
驱使着三柄魔剑的恶饕老祖直直向你冲来，而已经停下手的宁州化神们也正追着他飞速赶来...¤The evil gourmets who are driving the three demonic swords are coming straight at you, and the Ning Province Deity Transformation cultivators who have stopped are speeding after him...
猎魔试炼名次固然重要，但也切勿因此伤了同门情谊。¤Demon hunting trial ranking is important, but don't hurt your fellowship.
我派素来愿帮助陷于沙漠的凡人或修士脱困，你若在门派外围见到有人落难，大可伸出援手。¤I have always been willing to help mortals or cultivators trapped in the desert get out of trouble. If you see someone in trouble outside the school, you can lend a helping hand.

{$shili}自上次后一直龟缩在山门大阵中，鲜有弟子离开，还是别在这无趣的门派上浪费时间了。¤{$shili} has been cowering in the mountain gate's great formation since last time, with few disciples leaving, so it's better not to waste time on this uninteresting sect.
你悠闲地来到{$shili}山门，作为原本宁州五行宗门之一的郊近，如今却是四下无人。只有运转中的大阵依旧在无声地诉说着该宗门仍未消亡。¤You leisurely arrive at the {$shili} mountain gate, the outskirts of one of the original five element sects of Ning Province are now deserted in all directions. Only the functioning Great Formation still speaks silently of the sect's continued demise.
长老正在宗门大殿中等候，{FirstName}前辈请随我来。¤The elder is waiting in the sect hall. Senior {FirstName}, please come with me.
什么魑魅魍魉都敢闯我{$shili}，快滚，这里不欢迎你。¤All monsters dare to break into me {$shili}, hurry up, you are not welcome here.
该外门弟子虽然可能无法分辨白帝令和该信物的区别，但还是恭敬地回答了你。¤The outer disciple answers you respectfully, though he may not be able to tell the difference between the White Emperor's Decree and that token.
不知前辈来我{$shili}有何贵干？¤I wonder if the senior came to me {$shili}, what is it for you?
你……你是{FirstName}{LastName}！快去禀告掌门！¤You...you are {FirstName}{LastName}! Go and report to the head!
白帝楼有些事要与贵派掌门商量。¤The White Emperor's House has some business to discuss with the Master of your school.
不……不好！是{FirstName}{LastName}，快去禀告长老！¤No...not good! It's {FirstName}{LastName}, go and report to the elder!
长老正在宗门大殿中等候，前辈请随我来。¤The elder is waiting in the sect hall, senior please come with me.

抱歉，长老事务繁忙，{FirstName}道友请回吧。¤Sorry, the elders are busy, please come back, {FirstName} fellow daoists.
虽然我们金虹剑派在这次试炼中位列魁首，但却有两位师弟在魔物的手下丧了命。¤Although our Golden Rainbow Sword Sect was the leader in this trial, two juniors were killed by the monsters.
{$TmpTalkString}，何事？{w}{w=0.5}¤{$TmpTalkString}, what is it? {w}{w=0.5}
{$TmpTalkString}，最近修为可有长进？¤{$TmpTalkString}, has your training improved recently?
此次能战胜地魔你功不可没，不愧是我们金虹剑派的弟子！¤You are indispensable for being able to fight the demon this time. You are indeed a disciple of our Golden Rainbow Sword Sect!
你陷入了空灵的状态，但以你目前对阵道的领悟，你觉得距离顿悟相差一步。¤You are in an ethereal state, but based on your current understanding of the battle against Tao, you feel that you are one step away from epiphany.
你陷入了空灵的状态，但以你目前对炼器之道的领悟，你觉得距离顿悟相差一步。¤You are in an ethereal state, but with your current understanding of the way of refining tools, you feel that you are one step away from epiphany.

你抬头看到，一柄剑身铭刻了{SayStcVal=X}灵纹的仙剑漂浮于空中，浩荡的剑气环绕在其周围。¤You look up and see that a fairy sword engraved with {SayStcVal=X} spirit patterns floats in the air, surrounded by mighty sword energy.
地点上传错误¤Location upload error
老头，你还好吗？¤Old man, are you okay?
阴魂岛结束了它不知多少万年的闹剧，回归一片荒芜。¤The Island of Yin Souls ended its farce of many thousands of years and returned to a barren state.
但...我见你落了下风才...¤But... I saw that you fell behind before...
追了半晌后，因为遁速不济，已是不见二人踪影。你不想浪费更多时间，只好选择放弃。¤After chasing for a long time, because of the speed of evacuation is not good, is no longer two trace. You do not want to waste more time, so you have to choose to give up.
不多时，你便是发现这二人正运起法器激战，只是那女性修士略显颓势。你也没多想便已是手捏法诀，介入战局。¤In a short time, you found that the two were fighting with their magic weapons, but the female Vagrant Cultivator was slightly declining. You didn't think much of it, so you intervened in the battle with your hand.
反倒是那女修见有陌生修士突入，一时竟愣在原地，只留你二人打斗。¤On the contrary, the female Vagrant Cultivator saw a strange Vagrant Cultivator burst in, a moment actually froze in place, leaving only you two to fight.
道友，他没伤到你吧。¤Daoist, he did not hurt you, right?
这人不知是先前耗费了太多灵力还是如何，竟在数招过后，被你的神通直接击破护盾，连带着身体也被击穿，就此毙命。¤This person does not know whether he used up too much spiritual energy earlier or how, actually after a few moves, was directly broken through the shield by your divine ability, and with it, his body was also pierced, and he was killed.
少女的话语声脆如银铃，很是好听。只是像在自言自语，声音小到让你完全无法听清她在说什么。¤The young lady's words sounded like silver bells, very nice to hear. Just like talking to yourself, the voice is so small that you can't hear what she is saying at all.
那人对你也不感兴趣，又与先前的女修斗在一处。¤That person is also not interested in you, and with the previous female Vagrant Cultivator fight in one place.
她将一个法器丢过来，并向你扮了个鬼脸，然后运起遁术，仅是眨眼间便已消失在你视野内。¤She throws a magic weapon over and makes a face at you, and then uses her vanishment technique and disappears from your view in just a blink of an eye.
算了...终归是一番好意，这法器就当谢礼送你好了。¤Forget it... Afterall, you had good intentions. Take this treasure as a thank you gift.
要是我认真起来，他才不是我对手呢，哼。¤If I get serious, he is not my opponent, huh.
道友？¤Daoist?
哼，能有啥事，本还想从他嘴里问出这帮修炼采补之术的妖人来自何处，现在倒好，托你的福，我又得去找其他妖人了。¤Hm, what can happen, I wanted to ask from his mouth where this group of demons practicing the art of tapping came from, now it's good, thanks to you, I have to find other demons again.
你暗自盘算下敌我实力差距，有了大致结论后运起遁速头也不回地离开了。\n¤You secretly calculate the difference between the strength of the enemy and me, with a general conclusion after the Speed up the head did not return to leave. \n
可恶，就不应该想着...否则早就...¤Damn, should not have thought ... Otherwise, I would have...
这地方似乎不是很欢迎我...{w}{w=0.5}¤This place doesn't seem to welcome me...{w}{w=0.5}
你在附近的岛屿上寻了一处开阔的空地准备迎接天劫。¤You find an open clearing on a nearby island to prepare for the apocalypse.
哈哈哈，难怪这浪方逃的这么快，原来是怕被这天劫给波及了。¤Hahaha, no wonder this Lang Fang fled so quickly, so he was afraid of being affected by this heavenly tribulation.
与之前给我的那本无二，看来岛主并没有诓骗我们。¤It is the same as the one I was given before. It seems that the island master did not swindle us.
…总之，在下知道的都尽数告诉前辈了。¤...in short, I have told you everything I know.
你转头向声源望去——一块巨石背后，非也解除了敛息功法、小心翼翼地向你跑来。¤You turn your head to look at the source of the sound - a boulder behind, non also lifted the astringent technique, cautiously run towards you.
…你是说？岛主便是在等她飞升的那一天？¤...you mean? The island master is waiting for the day she ascends?
如果说岛主是真的在谋求复生之法，岂不是错怪岛主了？¤If the islander is really seeking the law of resurrection, is it not wrong to blame the islander?
此番…有劳前辈费心了。¤This time...I'm sorry for your trouble.
仔细想想，此条件虽然苛刻，但却并非无法实现，老夫在这铁剑中也不急这一时，有此逆天造化术也算是万幸了。¤Think about it, this condition is harsh, but not unattainable, the old man in this iron sword is not in a hurry this moment, with this heavenly creation technique is also considered a blessing.
你神识扫去，迅速浏览过其中的玄机。¤You swept away your soul sense and quickly browsed through the mysteries.
你可知道岛主那复生秘术的原理？¤Do you know the principle of the island master that rejuvenation secret art?
…既然如此，宝物一事便只得作罢了。¤...In that case, the matter of treasures will have to be left alone.
我没事，这是什么情况？¤I'm fine, what's going on?
嗯，我原以为这只是岛主用来控制其他魂体的噱头罢了。现在看来，岛主倒真有可能在筹划复生之事。¤Well, I originally thought that this was just a gimmick used by the island master to control other souls. Now it seems that the island master may really be planning for the resurrection.
将他打发走后，你找到了岛主原先所在的位置。¤After sending him away, you find the location where the Island Lord was originally located.
还好它对我没兴趣，不然我恐怕也难逃此劫…¤Luckily it is not interested in me, otherwise I'm afraid I can not escape this disaster...
无非只是一群想要重生的可怜人罢了。¤It's just a bunch of poor people who want to be reborn.
回到地面，这哪里还是什么阴魂岛——所有的魂体都消失不见，这座岛空旷的就好像它们一开始便不存在一样。¤Back on the ground, where is the island of ghosts - all the souls have disappeared, the island is as empty as if they did not exist in the first place.
道别后，你们便各自离开了。¤After saying goodbye, you left separately.
据岛主所说，它恰巧需要在其他修士飞升之时施展。¤According to the island master, it happens to need to be cast at the time of the ascension of other cultivators.
他又叹了一口气，便不再作声，只是低头思考着自己的事情。¤He sighed again, then stopped making a sound and just lowered his head to think about his own business.
走吧。¤Let's go.
倒是此人与岛主的图谋，可有什么关联？¤But this person and the island master's plan, can there be any connection?
骚动平息后，非也悄悄靠了过来。¤After the commotion subsided, non also quietly leaned over.
道友可有找到什么宝物？¤Do you have found any treasures?
只见地上静静地躺着一枚玉简，赫然便是那逆天造化术的原本。¤I saw a jade slip lying quietly on the ground, and it was the original of the Heavenly Creation Technique.
…道友若想要神阴石，气旋下面倒是有不少。¤...If you want a divine Yin stone, there are many below the cyclone.
那个时候，又会发生什么呢？¤At that time, what will happen again?
没错，岛主向他们许诺的复生之时，就在{$时间}年后。¤That's right, the time of resurrection promised to them by the island master was just {$time} years later.
需要在他人飞升时使用？条件竟会如此苛刻？¤You need to use it when others are ascending? How can the conditions be so harsh?
你将气旋下面的事情大致地讲述了一遍。起初他一脸难以置信的神情，慢慢的变得越来越阴沉。¤You recount the events beneath the cyclone in general terms. At first he has an incredulous look on his face, which slowly becomes more and more sombre.
…人？¤...people?
在下原以为这只是岛主用来控制其他魂体的噱头罢了，现在看来，岛主倒真有可能在筹划复生之事。¤I originally thought this was just a gimmick used by the Islander to control other souls, but now it seems likely that the Islander is really planning for a resurrection.
前辈可知道岛主那复生秘术的原理？¤Does Elder know the principle of the Island Master's secret technique of rejuvenation?
此术本座已经看过，它恰巧需要在其他修士飞升之时施展。¤This technique has been seen by the throne and it happens to need to be performed at the time of the ascension of other cultivators.
非也突然抬起头来，好像想起了什么东西。¤Non also looked up suddenly, as if remembering something.
你神识扫去，迅速浏览过其中的内容。¤You soul sense swept away and quickly browsed through its contents.
道友？你还活着？¤Fellow Daoist? You are still alive?
刚刚气旋中出现一道人影，将阴魂岛上的灵魂吸噬殆尽后便消失了。¤Just now a figure appeared in the cyclone and disappeared after sucking up all the souls on the Yin Soul Island.
前辈可有找到什么宝物？¤Did the seniors find any treasures?
既然此地已然捞不到什么好处，我便上别处寻觅机缘了。¤Since this place is no longer able to get any benefits, I will go elsewhere to look for opportunities.
既然已经查明没有宝物，再想此事也是无用。¤Now that it has been ascertained that there is no treasure, it is useless to think about the matter any further.
将他支开后，你找到了岛主原先所在的位置。¤After sending him away, you found the original location of the island master.
你们不约而同的沉默了下来，各自思考着其中利弊。¤You coincidentally fell silent, each thinking about the pros and cons.
道友，后会有期。¤Fellow Daoist, I'll see you later.
道友，既然已经查明没有宝物，再想此事也是无用。¤Fellow Daoist, since it has been ascertained that there is no treasure, it is useless to think about this matter.
有价值的东西倒是没有，只是见到了一个人。¤There is nothing of value, just met a person.
我原以为这只是岛主用来控制其他魂体的噱头罢了，现在看来，岛主倒真有可能在筹划复生之事。¤I originally thought that this was just a gimmick used by the island master to control other souls, but now it seems that the island master may really be planning the resurrection.
它恰巧需要在其他修士飞升之时施展。¤It happens to need to be cast when other cultivators are ascending.
…总之，我知道的都尽数告诉道友了，也不枉道友这次以身犯险。¤...In short, I have told you all that I know, and it is not in vain for you to take the risk this time.
既然此间事了，你当即便离开此地，踏上了新的旅程。¤Since this matter is over, you immediately left this place and embarked on a new journey.
此事想来也不会有多简单，现在至少存了一分念想。¤The matter will not be much easier, but now at least a memory remains.
…你若想要神阴石，气旋下面倒是有不少。¤...If you want a divine Yin stone, there are quite a few underneath the cyclone.
起初你说气旋下有个人，我是断然不相信的，不过联想到另一件事，这倒也在情理之中。¤At first you said there was a person under the cyclone, I did not believe it, but when I think of another thing, it makes sense.
前辈？¤Seniors?
这是什么情况，魂体为何都消失不见了？¤What is this, why have all the souls disappeared?
非也¤Not also
获得{color=#d0380a}《逆天造化术》{/color}¤Get {color=#d0380a}The Reverse Heaven Creation Technique{/color}
既然此地已然捞不到什么好处，在下便上别处寻觅机缘了。¤Since this place has not been able to get any benefits, I will go elsewhere to look for the opportunity.
当真？那便多谢前辈了。¤Is it true? Then, thank you very much, elder.
未曾知晓。¤Unknowingly.
当真？那便多谢道友了。¤Is that true? Then thank you very much, fellow Daoist.
我好像没有察觉到魔气的痕迹，倒是灵气有些稀薄。¤I don't seem to detect any traces of demonic energy, but rather the spiritual energy is a bit thin.
而炎萧则在灵舟上寻了一间房安心闭关疗伤。于是乎，你也没有将这不好的消息告诉他的意思，免得打扰到他。只是下意识地在操控灵舟前进的同时，为其注入些灵气以让前行速度更快，而不是单单用灵舟上的聚灵阵吸收天地灵气前进。¤And Yan Xiao is in the spirit boat to find a room at ease to close down and heal. So, you also did not tell him the bad news, so as not to disturb him. Just subconsciously while controlling the spirit boat forward, inject some spiritual energy into it to make the forward speed faster, instead of just using the spirit boat on the spiritual formation to absorb the heaven and earth spiritual energy forward.
但炎萧重伤初愈，体内魔气还未完全排除，恐怕功法运转间都尚还有些凝滞。想到这层，你自信地迎上那气势最强的魔修。¤But Yan Xiao seriously wounded, the body has not yet completely excluded the magic, I'm afraid that between the operation of the gong method are still some stagnation. Thinking about this layer, you confidently meet the most powerful evil cultivator.
这里看起来也不像曾发生过什么，玄道宗怎么就闭门谢客了？¤It doesn't look like anything ever happened here, so how come the Mystic Dao Sect is closed?
你看准一个气势最为强大的元婴后期魔修便迎了上去，剩下的元婴初期以及金丹后期魔修便暂时交给实力未完全恢复的炎萧了。¤You see one of the most powerful late Yuanying evil cultivator will meet up, the rest of the early Yuanying and late Jindan evil cultivator will be temporarily handed over to the strength has not fully recovered Yan Xiao.
有事则长，无事则短。¤If there's something, it's long, but if there's nothing, it's short.
好在除了传音符外，这一路再没出什么意外，让你也是安心了不少。¤The good thing is that apart from the voice transmission talisman, there were no more accidents along the way, so you are also much more at ease.
但你和炎萧皆是身经百战，运转功法，驱动法宝，蓄力神通，一气呵成，全无慌乱之色。¤But you and Yan Xiao are all experienced in a hundred battles, running gong methods, driving magic treasures, storing power divine power, all in one go, no panic color.
那些个金丹期修士甚至没来得及发出声响便已是化作飞灰散落于此，而剩余两个元婴期修士也是满脸绝望之色。¤Those Jindan stage cultivators did not even have time to make a sound before they were scattered into flying ashes, while the remaining two YuanYing stage cultivators were also full of despair.
只是我此前被围攻时有些魔气顺伤口入体，眼下还有少数残留体中。本想着之后再慢慢将之排出，现在却能感觉到那部分魔气在蠢蠢欲动，想必是受附近魔气的引动没错了。¤But I was previously besieged when some demonic energy into the body along the wound, there are still a few residues in the body. I was thinking of slowly expelling it afterwards, but now I can feel that part of the demonic energy is moving, I think it must be triggered by the nearby demonic energy is correct.
不知道，但附近似乎有魔气残留。¤I don't know, but there seems to be a residue of demonic energy nearby.
思虑既定，你驱使着灵舟绕过广陵城大阵，直接往那坐落于宁州东南角的玄道宗而去。¤After thinking about it, you drove the spirit boat around the Guangling City formation and went directly to the Mystic Dao Sect, which is located in the southeast corner of Ning Province.
一边说着，你一边感应这附近的灵气波动。果然不出你所料有微弱的魔气残留，似乎还被始作俑者处理过，若不是你修为高于此人，怕是很难察觉。¤While talking, you sense the spiritual energy fluctuations in this vicinity. As you expected there is a faint residue of demonic energy, it seems to have been handled by the originator, if not for your cultivation level higher than this person, it is difficult to detect.
待灵舟落于玄道宗山门前，你与炎萧早已伫立于船头。将灵舟收回储物袋中后，二人便是向玄道宗封闭的山门而去。¤When the spirit boat landed in front of the Mystic Dao Sect's mountain gate, you and Yan Xiao had already stood at the bow. After taking the spirit boat back into the storage bag, the two of them are heading towards the closed mountain gate of Mystic Dao Sect.
结束？呵呵，似乎还没。¤The end? Oh, it seems not yet.
又是数月过去，广陵城似是染坊围挡的城墙终于出现在你的眼帘中，各路修士穿梭于港口的阵法出入口，或是乘舟狩海兽归来，或是御剑觅奇珍而去。¤Another few months have passed, Guangling City seems to be the dyed-in-the-wool walls finally appear in your eyes, all kinds of cultivators shuttle through the port formation entrances and exits, either returning by boat hunting sea beasts, or the sword for exotic treasures and go.
你仔细感应了一番，但周遭除灵气有些稀薄之外，并未有炎萧所说的魔气。至少不是你能感应到的浓郁程度。¤You have carefully sensed, but the surrounding area, in addition to the spiritual Qi is a little thin, there is not Yan Xiao said the devil Qi. At least not to the extent that you can sense the richness.
魔气的痕迹么，我也没有发现。¤The traces of the devil's qi, I also did not find.
（玄道宗缩在宗门内不出来，只怕是之前战败了，担心附近还有魔修残留。但似乎是没有其他门派前来支援，难道...）¤(The Mystic Dao Sect shrinks inside the sect and does not come out, only afraid that the previous battle was defeated, fearing that there are still evil cultivators remaining nearby. But it seems that no other sects are coming to support, could it be...)
只见你冷哼一声，指掌间灵气隐现，只随手一挥便是勾动天地间灵气响应。¤With a cold snort, the aura between your fingers and palms appeared, and with a wave of your hand, you moved the aura of heaven and earth to respond.
数个隐藏在附近的魔修向你二人袭击而来，霎时间这玄道宗的山门处已经是魔气纵横。¤Several evil cultivators hiding nearby attacked you two, and all of a sudden this Mystic Dao Sect's mountain gate was already riddled with demonic energy.
你只匆忙扫了一眼这嵌在翠绿色山林间闪烁着玄紫色光芒的封印大阵，未发现有何变化后便驱动灵舟匆忙而去。¤You only hastily swept a glance at this embedded in the emerald green mountains and forests shimmering xuan purple light sealing formation, did not find any changes after driving the spirit boat hurriedly away.
（既然如此，等到了玄道宗再叫炎萧{$ChenHu}出关吧。）¤(In that case, wait until the Mystic Dao Sect and then call Yan Xiao {$ChenHu} out of the gate.)
从广陵城外到玄道宗也算不上远，入定再醒转后恰巧是路过天魔眼，离目的地也不过再有半日多光景。¤From outside Guangling City to the Mystic Dao Sect is not far, and after waking up again, I happened to pass by the Heavenly Devil's Eye, so it was only half a day before my destination.
逝者如川流，一去不还，不舍昼夜。¤The passing away is like a river flowing, one goes without returning, and does not give up day and night.
（看来传音符可能只是在阵法中受到了什么影响，导致无法发出消息而已。之前担心的宁州已经沦陷并没有发生。）¤(It seems that the sound transmission amulet may just be affected by something in the formation, resulting in the inability to send messages. The previous fear that Ning Province had fallen did not happen.)
其中两人实力明显是要高过你，且无法感知具体差多少，而其他数位都不过金丹后期而已，倒是不惧。¤The strength of two of them is obviously to be higher than you, and can not perceive the specific difference between how much, while the other several are but late Jindan only, is not afraid.
此处虽有战斗的痕迹，但似乎结束很久了。可不知为何玄道宗依旧全力运转着护宗大阵。¤There are traces of battle here, but it seems to have ended a long time ago. But I don't know why the Mystic Dao Sect is still operating at full power to protect the sect.
（这数年间连日驾驭灵舟，我也有些乏了，不如在路上运功调息一番，若真有什么意外，到时候也更好应对。）¤(I'm a bit tired from driving the spirit boat for several years, so I might as well run my energy on the way to take a rest, so that if there are really any accidents, I can better deal with them.)
我...我顶住他，你快去天魔眼通知其他人！¤I'll... I'll hold him off, you go to the Heavenly Demon Eye and inform the others!
距你们动身赶往宁州已是有些时日。¤It has been some time since you left to rush to Ning Province.
（应该是没错，这魔教和之前伏击炎萧的是同一势力，有毁坏传音符之能，所以玄道宗修士若是不敢以身犯险，根本联系不上其他门派。）¤(It should be right, this devil sect and the previous ambush Yan Xiao is the same force, have the ability to destroy the sound transmission talisman, so Mystic Dao Sect cultivators if they do not dare to risk their lives, simply can not contact other sects.)
（既然如此...）¤(In that case...)
当然，也有不少体修者仗着肉身强悍，轻装戏浪，以借无尽之势而淬形骸。但总有一两人在数个浪头后便是消弭无踪，再难寻其踪迹。¤Of course, there are also many body cultivators rely on the strong physical body, light clothing play waves, to take advantage of the endless potential and quench the form. But there are always one or two people in a few waves is eliminated without a trace, and it is difficult to find its trace.
你看着眼前没什么变化的广陵城，心中的担忧更是放下不少。¤You look at the Guangling City, which has not changed much in front of you, the worry in your heart is even more put down a lot.
你展开神识探查，果然有数个魔修凭借秘法隐藏于附近，但于你而言，他们更像是光明正大地杵在各处。¤You unfold the soul sense probe, indeed there are several evil cultivators with secret method hidden in the vicinity, but in your case, they are more like bright and square pestle in various places.
这一路你操控灵舟的同时还一直在联系宁州的各位道友，却一直没有得到回复，倒是仍能收到其他不相关的消息。¤You have been contacting all the friends in Ning Province while controlling the spirit boat, but you have not received any reply, but you can still receive other unrelated news.
也可能是...¤Or maybe...
师兄！¤Brother!
又有一人，向你冲来！¤There is another person, rushing towards you!
一名离火门的巡逻弟子从前方经过，但因为修为太低，并没有发现你的存在。¤A patrol disciple who was away from the Heavenly Fire Gate passed by, but because his cultivation level was too low, he didn't find your existence.
嗯？敌袭！¤Huh? Enemy attack!
一名巡逻弟子向你袭来。¤A patrol disciple attacked you.
一名巡逻弟子向你点头示意。¤A patrol disciple nods to you.
站住！此地离火门所属，闲杂人等速速离去！¤Stop! This place is Heavenly Fire Gate, and the idlers leave at the same speed!
锈渍铁剑从你的背后挣脱出来，飞至半空之中，红光大盛，将剑灵周身翻涌的魔气不断吸入。那剑灵才被你重创，没能挣扎几下，就彻底消失不见了。¤The rust-stained iron sword broke free from your back and flew into the air. The red light was flourishing, and the devilish energy surged from the sword spirit was continuously inhaled. The sword spirit was hit hard by you. If you didn't struggle a few times, it was completely Disappeared.
要是再能找到这样的宝地让此剑吸收魔气，它的威能大概可以更进一层。对于我魂魄的修复想来也是大有益处！¤If you can find such a treasure again to allow this sword to absorb the devilish energy, its power can probably be improved. It will also be very beneficial to the restoration of my soul!
它刚刚吸收完魔气，应该就已经提升了一个档次了，就连我都觉得自己的魂魄又壮大了几分。想来若是有足够的补充，它是有自行恢复的能力的。\r\n¤It has just absorbed the devil energy, it should have been upgraded to a level, even I feel that my soul has grown a little bit. I think if there are enough supplements, it has the ability to recover on its own. \r\n
再加上它刚刚吸收的可是纯阳法宝级别的剑灵，虽说这剑灵才刚刚被你重创...我想这至少也得是同级别的法宝才能做得到的。¤In addition, it has just absorbed a pure-yang magic weapon level sword spirit, although this sword spirit has just been hit hard by you... I think this can be done only by a magic weapon of the same level.
总之，现在这剑灵老大被灭了，那些小剑灵应该也不会再有什么异动了，还是先离开这里吧。¤In short, now that the sword spirit boss has been annihilated, those little sword spirits shouldn't have any changes anymore, let's leave here first.
看来得想办法打听打听，宁州还有哪些地方可能会产生“魔气”，也许可以获得其它的线索...¤It seems that we have to find a way to find out what other places in Ning Province might produce magic energy, and maybe we can get other clues...
我前些日子出海遇到蓬莎岛的船队，真是让人心惊胆战...要知道他们为了资源可是连自己人都打劫，你若是出海可千万不要招惹他们。¤I met the fleet of Pongsha Island when I went to sea a few days ago. It was really frightening... You know that they robbed themselves for resources. If you go to sea, don't provoke them.
（看来撑不了多久了...）¤（Looks like it won't last much longer...）
正准备摄取自己的战利品时，古树驱使着其他根须向你袭来。¤Just as you are about to ingest your own loot, the ancient tree drives other roots towards you.
修炼时打瞌睡被魏老敲醒。\n与阴鳞蟒战斗时受他指点。\n与他一起闯御剑门。¤The actual fact is that you will be able to get a lot more than just a few of these. \I was instructed by him when I fought with the Yin Scale Python. \nBreaking into the Royal Sword Gate with him.
（我一死，老头怕是也要在这海底躺上个千百年乃至魂飞魄散了...）¤（Once I die, the old man is afraid to lie on the bottom of this sea for a thousand years or even soul...）
结果不但没有起到太好的作用，还令你体内本就是留存不多的灵气又离枯竭近了一步。¤The results not only did not play too good a role, but also make your body is not much left of the aura from the depletion of a step closer.
身前是插在根须上的诛仙剑，剑芒大盛。\n身后是浮在海水中的倪旭欣，行动迟缓。¤In front of the body is inserted in the root beard of the immortal sword, the sword awning is big. \n behind is floating in the sea water Ni XuXin, slow action.
（等出去了，得让你好好面壁思过。）¤（When we get out, we'll have to make you face the wall properly.）
在你沉浸于悲伤时，诛仙剑的剑芒逐渐暗淡了下去，古树也是再次向你和倪旭欣横扫过来。¤As you are drowning in grief, the sword aura of the Immortal Punishing Sword gradually dims, and the ancient tree is once again sweeping towards you and Ni XuXin.
与他一起闯天魔眼。\n与他一起闯宁州古迹。\n与他一起在御剑门密阁猜测凌轩的下落。\n¤Break into the eye of the sky devil with him. \nBreak into the Ning Province monuments with him. \n With him to guess the whereabouts of Ling Xuan in the secret pavilion of the Royal Sword Gate. \n
魏无极满是戏谑的声音传入你的耳中，一点也不像老头子平时的性格。¤Wei Wuji's voice full of banter comes into your ears, not at all like the old man's usual character.
留在原地的，只有断裂的树根，以及你和倪旭欣的鲜血。但也即将散去。¤All that remains in place are the broken roots and the blood of you and Ni XuXin. But also about to disperse.
闻言你也是强打精神，不自觉地，手头的攻击又是强了几分。¤Smell you are also strong spirit, unconsciously, the attack at hand is a few more points stronger.
下一击已至！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤The next blow has arrived! {vpunch=10,0.5}
你只能拼命吸收附近的灵气，然后借此催动护体神通，企图从接下来的攻击中存活。¤You can only desperately absorb the nearby aura, and then use it to activate your body shield divine ability in an attempt to survive the next attack.
往左看...往右看...往上看...甚至是神识探查地底..都不见那半透明的残魂...都没有魏无极的身影。¤Look to the left... Look to the right... Look up... Even the soul sense to search the ground... There is no translucent remnant soul... There is no figure of Wei Wuji.
老头...¤Old man ...
（哼，臭{xiaozi}都到这境地了还不想我点好。）¤（Hmph, the stinky {xiaozi} have reached this point and still do not want me to point good.）
成了！倪兄我们快走！¤It's done! Ni brother we go!
结果不但没有起到太好的作用，还令你体内本就是留存不多的灵气又离枯竭近了一步，再次被古树扎根成功¤As a result, not only did it not work too well, but it also made the aura in your body, which was already not much left, one step closer to depletion, and once again the ancient tree was rooted successfully
不用阴阳颠倒炼，岂无水火淬锋芒？诛仙剑，起！¤The sword is not refined with the inversion of yin and yang, is there no water and fire to quench the sharpness? Immortal Punishing Sword, rise!
眼见逃跑不成，也只得御剑，或是施展神通，再次与古树斗在一处。但你们之前面对单独的根须都只能勉强寻得逃跑的机会，这场战斗的结局自然是不言而喻。¤When you see that you can't escape, you have to use your sword, or use your magic powers to fight with the ancient tree in one place again. But you can only barely find a chance to escape before facing the individual root, the end of this battle is naturally self-explanatory.
一时是剑气破空之音四起，树根挥舞之声跌伏。¤The sound of sword gas breaking the air was heard in all directions, and the sound of roots waving fell.
仔细听来，又感觉他言语中满是决绝。不过他一个元婴修士的残魂此时又能做什么呢，就算想舍身救你，恐怕也...¤Listen carefully, and feel that his words are full of determination. But what can he do at this time a YuanYing cultivator's remnant soul, even if you want to save your life, I'm afraid...
慌乱中你硬接古树一记鞭打，肉身险些崩溃。但也借力拔出了诛仙剑，并靠到倪旭欣附近，确认了他只是晕了过去。¤In a panic you hard to receive the ancient tree a whip, the flesh nearly collapsed. But also used the force to pull out the Immortal Punishing Sword and leaned near Ni XuXin and confirmed that he just passed out.
都怪我...是我太弱了...明明都快成功了...明明都快迈出成仙的那一步了...¤It's my fault... I was too weak... Obviously almost succeeded... I was so close to taking the step to become an immortal...
不由得想起初入仙途的一幕幕...¤I can't help but remember the scene when I first entered the immortal path...
我已经发传音符给师祖了！{FirstName}{xiongdi}撑住啊！¤I've already sent a voice transmission talisman to the master! {FirstName}{xiongdi}Hold on!
还没等你们交流什么，下一击已至！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Before you can communicate anything, the next blow has arrived! {vpunch=10,0.5}
你们二人正准备用遁术冲出古树的范围，却发现其他的根须也是围了上来，显然是没有放你们走的打算。¤The two of you were about to use the vanish technique to rush out of the range of the ancient tree, but found that the other roots and beards were also surrounding you, apparently without the intention of letting you go.
在你回想时，扎根于你的树根也是被斩断，让你得以观察战场的情况。¤As you think back, the roots rooted in your tree are also chopped off, allowing you to observe the battlefield.
你与根须缠斗了不知多少回合，终于是将它从古树本体上击落。数个红中带粉的未知果实也随之滚落在地。¤You tangled with the root whisker for an unknown number of rounds, and finally it was knocked off the ancient tree proper. Several unknown fruits, red with pink, also roll down to the ground.
古树近十人合围粗的根须在你眼前不断飞舞着，但对于你们二人而言，连扎根于身上的“细藤”都已经是疲于应付，更不用考虑更多。¤The roots of the tree, nearly ten people thick, are flying in front of your eyes, but for the two of you, even the 'thin vine' rooted in your body is already tired to deal with, let alone consider more.
不用阴阳颠倒炼，岂无水火淬锋芒？诛仙剑，起！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤If you don't use Yin and Yang to refine, how can you quench your sharpness without water and fire? The Immortal Punishing Sword, rise! {vpunch=10,0.5}
为了你的大弟子...我们才来图南海的...你怎么可以...¤For the sake of your great disciple... We only came to the South Sea of Tu... How can you...
你虽被树根困住不知外界情况，但也不难猜到几分。¤Although you are trapped by the roots of the tree do not know the outside world, but it is not difficult to guess a few points.
你用诛仙剑硬挡了这一记挑击，但也被挑飞。如同御剑飞行一般，从原来的漩涡中心的位置急速向海面飞去。¤You used the Immortal Punishing Sword to block the picking blow hard, but you were also picked off. Like the flight of the sword, from the original location of the center of the vortex to the surface of the sea in a hurry.
（宁州...无尽之海...如此之多的绝境我都闯过来了，没想到竟会陨落在海底古树的树根里变成它的养分。）¤（Ning Province... Endless Sea... So many desperate situations I have broken through, I did not expect to fall in the roots of the ancient tree under the sea to become its nutrients.）
你用诛仙剑硬挡了这一记挑击，但也同倪旭欣一同被挑飞。如同御剑飞行一般，从原来的漩涡中心的位置急速向海面飞去。¤You used the Immortal Punishing Sword to block the blow, but you were also sent flying along with Ni XuXin. As if flying with a sword, from the original location of the center of the whirlpool to the surface of the sea in a hurry.
慌乱中你硬接古树一记鞭打，肉身险些崩溃。但也借力拔出了诛仙剑，并靠到倪旭欣附近。¤In a panic, you took a whip from the tree and your body nearly collapsed. But also used the strength to pull out the Immortal Punishing Sword and leaned to Ni XuXin near.
一时间是根须乱舞，你和倪旭欣躲闪还来不及，更不用说古树还一直想扎根你们的肉体上汲取灵气。¤You and Ni XuXin were too late to dodge, not to mention the ancient tree kept trying to root your flesh to extract the aura.
为了你的大弟子...我们才来图南海的...你怎么可以...就这么...¤For the sake of your eldest disciple... We only came to the South China Sea... How can you... Just like that...
（我纵横一世，难逢敌手，没想到竟会陨落在海底古树的树根里变成它的养分，贼老天，我不甘心啊！！！）¤（I have been across the world, it is difficult to meet an enemy, I did not expect to fall in the roots of the ancient tree under the sea to become its nutrients, thief God, I am not willing to ah!
结果不但没有起到太好的作用，还令你体内本就是留存不多的灵气又离枯竭近了一步，再次被古树扎根成功。¤The results not only did not work too well, but also made your body is not much left of the aura and close to depletion, again by the ancient tree roots success.
身前是插在根须上的诛仙剑，剑芒大盛。\n身后是浮在海水中的倪旭欣，不知死活。¤In front of him is inserted in the root beard of the Immortal Punishing Sword, the sword aura. \n behind is floating in the sea water Ni XuXin, do not know dead or alive.
咱们寨主向来不问世事一心求道，这一次怎么收留了这么多人？¤Our lord has always been unconcerned with worldly matters and is dedicated to seeking the Way, but why has he taken in so many people this time?
嗯？咱们寨主是这么重情义的人？¤Hmm? Is our Lord such a sentimentalist?
嗯，据说是从衡州逃难来的，叫什么玄古门。¤Well, it is said to have fled from Hengzhou and is called something like the Profound Ancient Sect.
听说，他们门主和咱们寨主是师兄弟。¤I heard that the master of their sect and the master of our fortress are master brothers.
你小点声。我听我师父说，寨主境界多年难以寸进，而这玄古门有一套独门的炼丹秘法对那蜕凡化神有不少增益。¤Keep your voice down. I heard from my master that the fortress master's cultivation has been difficult to advance for many years, and this Profound Ancient Sect has a unique secret method of alchemy that is be very beneficial to Deity Transforming.
最近来了好多外人啊。¤So many outsiders have come in recently.
你在逸风城内随意逛了一圈，今日的斗法台虽然依旧热闹，但却都是些修为稀松平常的角色，上并没有什么值得注意的比试。¤You wandered around in Yifeng City. Although today's Doufatai is still lively, they are all characters with ordinary cultivation bases. There is no notable comparison.
你只看了一会儿比试就倍感无聊，便兴致索然地打道回府了。¤You just watched the competition for a while and got bored, so you went back home with uninterestedness.
你又随意逛了逛街道上支起的摊位，发现都是些稀松平常的物件，便兴致索然地打道回府了。¤You wandered around the stalls erected on the street again, and found that they were all ordinary objects, and you went back home with uninterestedness.
{FirstName}供奉过奖了，这只是我们白家世代相传的手艺而已，既然{FirstName}供奉感兴趣，那我便说上一二。¤Guest elder {FirstName} is flattering me, this is just a craft that has been passed down from generation to generation in our Bai family, since guest elder {FirstName} is interested, then I will say a few things.
不过我倒是很好奇，{FirstName}供奉从外族人的角度来看，更愿意支持哪一方呢？¤But I'm curious, guest elder {FirstName}. Which side would you be more willing to support from an outsider's point of view?
我自然支持吴家。碎星商会能够有如今的实力，靠的正是不断吸纳各种人才，唐家和你们白家不也是如此么。¤I naturally support the Wu family. Broken Star Merchant Guild can have today's strength, relying on the continuous absorption of a variety of talents, the Tang family and your White family is not also the same.
若我能自行收集到足够的材料，白长老可愿帮我炼制六品灵舟？¤If I can collect enough materials on my own, would Elder Bai be willing to help me refine a sixth-grade spirit boat?
{FirstName}供奉可是找到了能用来炼制灵舟的{color=#d0380a}六品木属性材料{/color}？¤Guest elder {FirstName}, did you find the {color=#d0380a}sixth grade wood attribute material that can be used to refine the spirit boat{/color}?
比试之日，你们商会的会长曾提及商会的立足之本，在我看来，这立足之本便是团结。从这一点来看，一直保持中立的白家反倒是最好的选择。¤On the day of the competition, the president of your chamber mentioned the foundation of the chamber, and in my opinion, that foundation is unity. From this point of view, the White Family, which has remained neutral, is the best choice.
原来如此，我会好好考虑{FirstName}供奉的意见的...¤I see, I will take guest elder {FirstName}'s opinion into consideration...
既然这次的比试是唐家取胜，那此次选举我可能更倾向于选择唐家的长老。当然，我也需要参考现任会长的建议，在长老会开始前还不好下定论。¤Since this competition was won by the Tang family, I might be more inclined to choose the Tang family's elders for this election. Of course, I also need to refer to the current president's suggestion, and it's not good to make a final decision before the elders' meeting starts.
原来是{FirstName}供奉，不知找我何事？¤Oh, it's guest elder {FirstName}, I wonder what is the matter?
想要炼制六品灵舟对我而言也并非易事，何况最近长老会诸事繁杂，恐怕没有空帮{FirstName}供奉炼制了。¤I'm not sure it's easy for me to refine a sixth-rate spirit boat, not to mention that the Elders' Council has been busy lately, so I'm afraid there's no time to help guest elder {FirstName} refine it.
炼制六品灵舟所必须的{color=#d0380a}六品木属性材料{/color}极为稀有，若{FirstName}供奉真能找来的话，我答应为你炼制便是。¤The {color=#d0380a}sixth-grade wood-attribute material{/color} necessary to refine the sixth-grade spirit boat is extremely rare. If guest elder {FirstName} could actually find them, I'll refine it for you then.
唐家更注重培养族内弟子的想法其实没有错，抛开我的身份而言，我更欣赏唐家。¤There's actually nothing wrong with the idea of the Tang family focusing more on training disciples within the clan, and my status aside, I appreciate the Tang family more.
既然这次的比试是{FirstName}供奉代表吴家取胜，那我可能更倾向于选择吴家的长老。当然，我也需要参考现任会长的建议，在长老会开始前还不好下定论。¤Since this competition was won by Guest Elder {FirstName} representing the Wu family, I might be more inclined to choose the Wu family's elders. Of course, I also need to refer to the current president's advice, and it's not good to make a conclusion until the elders' meeting begins.
一件好的灵舟法宝有三点至关重要，速度，防御，和聚灵能力。若是用最好的灵舟，横跨一片海域也仅需数月，还能抵御各种灵气乱流，闭关修行之时也能更稳定的供给灵气。¤A good spirit boat magic treasure has three vital points, speed, defense, and the ability to gather spirits. If you use the best spirit boat, it will only take a few months to cross a sea, but it can also withstand all kinds of aura turbulence, and can also be a more stable supply of aura when you are in seclusion.
想要炼制上好的灵舟，除了对炼制材料有极为严苛的要求，还需要在炼制时铭刻精妙的防御和聚灵阵法，没有独到的手法是不可能炼制成功的。¤To refine a good spirit boat, in addition to the extremely stringent requirements for refining materials, but also need to inscribe subtle defense and spiritual formation when refining, without the unique techniques is impossible to refine successfully.
早就听闻白家善于炼制灵舟，白长老更是当世为数不多有能力炼制六品灵舟之人，特意来与白长老讨教一番。¤I've heard that the White Family is good at refining spirit boats, and Elder White is one of the few people in the world who is capable of refining a sixth-grade spirit boat, so I came here to discuss with Elder White for some advice.
还有谁？¤Who else?
来到这里比拼擂台的修士大多都是眼馋那连家的传承功法，这无尽之海上多一分实力就多一分保障，哪有修士会放过增强实力的机会呢？¤Most of the cultivators who come here to compete in the arena are greedy for the inheritance techniques of the Lianjia family. If there is more strength in this endless sea, there will be more protection. How can a cultivator miss the opportunity to increase strength?
那血剑宫长老疗伤之所应该就在在九嶷山中...{$daihao}，随我来。¤The place where the Blood Sword Palace elders heal should be in the Jiuyi Mountain... {$daihao}, come with me.
那枯木老祖向{color=#d0380a}东面{/color}逃去了，先跟过去看看吧。¤That Old Man of Deadwood is fleeing to the {color=#d0380a} east{/color}, so let's follow him there first.
根须被斩断了，{xiongdi}快跑！¤The roots are cut off, {xiongdi} run!
这{color=#d0380a}火弹术{/color}乃是火系的基础法门，点击技能图标，调动体内灵气并释放它。¤{color=#d0380a}Fire Bomb{/color} is a basic skill fire utilizes, click the skill icon, mobilize the Qi in your body and cast it.
看来掌握的还不错，不过仙家法门妙用无穷，你若是能领悟{color=#d0380a}五行相生{/color}的技巧，这些基础法术也会威力大增。¤It seems that you have mastered it quite well, but spells used by cultivators are wonderfully versatile. If you can grasp the {color=#d0380a}Synergy of the 5 elements{/color}, these basic spells will be much more powerful.
运气术能够助你调整体内灵气属性，若释放运气术后能吸取到木属性灵气释放{color=#d0380a}木刺{/color}，{color=#d0380a}火弹{/color}的威力也会得到提升。¤The Luck Spell helps you adjust the elements of the Qi in your body. If you can absorb some Wood Qi after casting Luck Spell, then cast {color=#d0380a}Wood Spikes{/color}, and the power of the following {color=#d0380a}Fire Bomb{/color} will be enhanced.
不错，现在尝试先释放木刺，再释放火弹，以触发{color=#d0380a}五行连击{/color}的效果。¤Nice, now try casting Wood Spikes first and then Fire Bomb to trigger the {color=#d0380a}Combo{/color} effect with the five elements.
喂，臭{xiaozi}，你不会连个区区{color=#d0380a}火弹{/color}都使不出来吧？¤Hey, stinky {xiaozi}, you can't even use a measly {color=#d0380a}Fire Bomb{/color}, can you?
运气术可是修真者最最基础的法术了，点击技能图标，然后释放运气术。¤Luck spell is the most basic spell for cultivators. Click the skill icon and to cast Luck spell.
修士之间对决，{color=#d0380a}遁速{/color}尤为重要。遁速更快的一方可以抢先出手，占尽先机。¤In a fight between cultivators, {color=#d0380a}speed{/color} is especially important. The side with more speed can strike first and gain the upper hand.
点击技能图标以释放{color=#d0380a}运气术{/color}。释放技能时，你可以手动调整待选区的灵气。选择三种你暂时无需使用的灵气，便有可能通过{color=#d0380a}运气术{/color}重新吸收到你所需要的灵气。¤Click on the skill icon to cast {color=#d0380a}Luck Spell{/color}. After using the skill, you can manually adjust the selection of Qi. Select 3 types of Qi you don't need at the moment and, with some luck, you maybe able to get the Qi you need with {colour=#d0380a}Luck Spell{/colour}.
如果你体内的灵气已经不足以释放法术了，就只能先{color=#d0380a}结束回合{/color}，再重新吸收天地灵气。¤If you don't have enough Qi in your body to cast another spell, you will have to {color=#d0380a}end your turn{/color} in order to regain Qi from the world.
随着修为的提升，你体内能够储存的{color=#d0380a}灵气上限{/color}也会越来越多。只有这样，你才能使用那些更为强大的神通。¤As your cultivation level rises, the {color=#d0380a}maximum amount of Qi{/color} you can store in your body will also increase. Only then will you be able to use those more powerful divine abilities.
还记得我教你的东西么？仙家法门的诀窍，在于吸收天地间的五行灵气，来释放对应的法术。¤Remember what I taught you? The trick to cultivation spells is to first absorb the five elements of Qi from the world and then cast the corresponding spells.
五行相生便是{color=#d0380a}金生水{/color}、{color=#d0380a}水生木{/color}、{color=#d0380a}木生火{/color}、{color=#d0380a}火生土{/color}、{color=#d0380a}土生金{/color}。这是最简单也是最重要的规律。¤The five elements and theirs synergistic cycle are {color=#d0380a}Metal gathers Water{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Water nourishes Wood{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Wood fuels Fire{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Fire feeds Earth{/color}, {color=#d0380a}Earth yields Metal{/color}. This is the simplest and most important law.
单击{color=#d0380a}结束回合{/color}以进入下一回合，若灵气数量高于上限则需要{color=#d0380a}消散灵气{/color}才可结束回合。¤Click {color=#d0380a}End Round{/color} to advance to the next turn, if your Qi is above your limit you will need to {color=#d0380a}Dissipate Qi{/color} before ending the turn.
所以{color=#d0380a}不要{/color}先急着释放火弹，先使用运气术调整灵气释放木刺，以达到更高的伤害。¤So {color=#d0380a}don't{/color} rush and cast Fire Bomb first, use your Luck Spell to adjust your Qi, and cast Wood Spikes first to deal higher damage with your Fire Bomb.
如果装备了武器，可以在回合的任意时候择机使用。不同的法器妙用无穷，比如我栖身的这把剑，在寻常时候可以作为普通的符器宝剑驱使，在危急时刻则有不一样的神通。¤If equipped with a weapon, it can be used at any time in a round. Different weapons have different uses, such as the sword I am carrying. It can be used as an ordinary sword during normal times, but it will have special power in times of crisis.
若装备了武器且尚未使用，可单击左下武器图标释放武器技能。¤If a weapon is equipped and not yet used, click on the lower left weapon icon to cast the weapon skill.
嗯，以第一次实战来看，你这表现还算不错。¤Well, judging from the first actual combat, your performance is pretty good.
有的时候，你需要重新沟通周天的灵气，{color=red}使用三张不同系{/color}的灵气牌，来释放运气术。¤Sometimes, you need to re-allocate your Qi, {color=red} use three different elements of Qi cards {/color} to cast Luck Spell.
就是这样，现在，用{color=red}两张水系灵气牌{/color}来释放水弹。¤That's it, now, use {color=red}two water aura cards{/color} to release water bombs.
看来你掌握的还不错，不过道家法门妙用无穷，你若是能领悟{color=red}五行相生{/color}的技巧，这些基础法术也会威力大增。¤It seems that you have a good grasp of it, but the Taoist methods are infinitely useful. If you can comprehend the {color=red}Elemental Cycle{/color} skills, these basic spells will also be much more powerful.
修士间的对决，体内五行灵气的数量最为重要。如果你体内的灵气已经不足以释放法术了，就只能先{color=red}结束回合{/color}，再重新吸收天地灵气。¤In the battle between cultivators, the amount of the five elements aura in your body is the most important. If the aura in your body is not enough to release the spell, you can only {color=red}end the round{/color} first, and then re-absorb the heaven and earth aura.
随着修为的提升，你体内能够储存的{color=red}灵气上限{/color}也会越来越多。只有这样，你才能使用那些更为强大的神通。¤As your cultivation level increases, the {color=red} upper limit of aura{/color} that you can store in your body will also increase. Only in this way can you use the more powerful magical powers.
琚长老，这是为何？¤Elder Ju, for what reason?
琚运琦，这也是你们风雨楼的人吧？发生了什么，你就不和我解释解释么？¤Ju Yunqi, this is also someone from your Storm Manor, right? Won't you give me an explanation on what happened?
事发突然，你帮我解决了此人，自会与你解释。¤It happened suddenly, so if you help me with this problem, I will explain all.
道友，我会用灵气护罩抵挡他的攻势，但恐怕支撑不了太久。剩下的就靠你了！¤Fellow Daoist, I will use the aura shield to resist his offensive, but I am afraid it will not last long. The rest is up to you!
不好，附近的阵法已经启动了！¤No, the formation nearby has already been activated!
我们会想办法帮你破除这附近的阵法，你自己多加小心。¤We will find a way to help you get rid of the formation around here, so be careful yourself.
他驱阵用的手法便是传说中的《乾坤百巧诀》，这种手法失传多年，没想到今天在这里又见到了。¤The method he used to drive the formation was the legendary One Hundred Skills of Universe. This method has been lost for many years. I didn't expect to see it again here today.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，最外围的土相仙阵和灵水仙阵都已经破除了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, the outermost earth-phase fairy formations and lingshuixian formations have been destroyed.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我们已经将聚灵阵和霜天寒月阵破除，他如今只能凭本能驱阵，接下来要一口气破除剩下所有的阵法。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, we have already destroyed the Spirit Gathering Array and Frost Sky Cold Moon Array. Now he can only drive the array by instinct, and then he will destroy all the remaining arrays in one go.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，剩下的大部分阵法都已经破除，剩下的就交给你了！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, most of the remaining formations have been broken, and the rest is left to you!
好...好强的吸力...完全动不了...¤Good...so strong suction...can't move at all...
这吞噬秘术不愧是上古神兽的传承，没有那么容易破解。¤This devouring secret technique is worthy of the inheritance of the ancient beasts, and it is not so easy to crack.
不过依我看，这股吸力应当持续不了太久。坚持一段时间，找机会逃到一个相对安全的地方，我们再从长计议！¤But in my opinion, the suction shouldn't last long. Hold on for a while, find a chance to escape to a relatively safe place, and we'll have a long-term plan!
吸力似乎慢慢减弱了...¤The suction seems to be slowly fading...
{FirstName}{xiongdi}小心，我来助你！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi} be careful, I'll help you!
{FirstName}{xiongdi},小心应对，我们不能再继续{color=#d0380a}激怒{/color}煮海长老了。¤{xiongdi} {FirstName},Be careful how you respond, we can't continue {color=#d0380a} to anger {/color} the Boiling Sea elders any more.
龙湛前辈，且慢出手，能否先听我一言？¤Senior Long Zhan, wait a minute, can you listen to me first?
使用{color=#d0380a}相生{/color}的灵气牌释放灵力护罩，如金与水，水与木等，可以提升它的效果。¤Utilize {color=#d0380a}Qi that synergies{/color} to cast a stronger Spiritual Shield with elements such as, metal and water, water and wood, etc.
此人修为与你相当，虽说你刚刚受了一些轻伤，但若能熟练运用{color=#d0380a}灵力护罩{/color}保护自身，便可立于不败之地¤This person's level of cultivation is similar to yours. Although you have just taken some damage from the previous fight, if you can skillfully use {color=#d0380a}Spiritual Shield{/color} to protect yourself, you shall be undefeatable.
尝试使用一点{color=#d0380a}水{/color}灵气，与一点{color=#d0380a}木{/color}灵气，来释放灵力护罩吧。¤Try using a bit of {color=#d0380a}water{/color} Qi and a bit of {color=#d0380a}wood{/color} Qi to cast the Spiritual Shield.
该强调的都说完了，接下来就看你的了，术法无眼，小心点{xiaozi}！¤I've said what's needed to be said, from here on it's all up to you. Be careful {xiaozi}!
仍有未理解的可以随时单击右下角问号打开{color=#d0380a}帮助{/color}界面查阅。¤If you still don't understand something, feel free to click on the question mark in the bottom right hand corner to open the {color=#d0380a}help{/color} screen.
古神教的老鬼，把剑交出来！¤Old devil of the Ancient Gods Sect, hand over the sword!
吼！¤Roar!
一道炙热的气息传来，火麒麟凝聚出数团硕大的火球，砸向恶饕，白鹿真人的攻击也接踵而至。但他全然不顾自身伤势，又向你冲了过来。¤A scorching heat comes from the fire qilin as he gathers several huge balls of fire and smashes them at the evil gourmets, and the attacks of the White Deer Realm follow. But he all but ignored his own injuries and charged at you again.
驱！¤Drive!
无数藤蔓从水下窜出，将恶饕老祖紧紧缠住，但很快，便被其挣脱了大半。¤Countless vines sprang out from underwater and wrapped themselves tightly around the evil gourmand, but soon, they were mostly broken free.
真是棘手...居然只凭蛮力就...¤It's tricky... How can you use brute force to...
哼，让我来会会他。¤Heck, let me meet him.
混元子连掐法诀，只见一只硕大的指印于半空中慢慢浮现，又缓缓向恶饕老祖压去。¤A large fingerprint slowly emerged in mid-air and slowly pressed towards the evil gourmets.
一阵巨响后，指印消散。硬接下这次攻击的恶饕似乎只是被击退了一些距离，却并未受到太致命的伤害。¤After a loud bang, the fingerprints dissipated. The evil gourmets who took the attack hard seemed to have been knocked back some distance, but were not too fatally injured.
小心。¤Beware.
白鹿真人闪身挡在恶饕老祖身前，凝聚出一道灵气屏障，硬接下他这次的攻击。¤Real White Deer dodged and blocked in front of the Evil Gourmand Ancestor, forming an aura barrier to take his attack hard.
再接我一招！¤Catch me again!
吼，这老怪物还真不好对付。¤Roar, this old monster is not easy to deal with.
保护好{FirstName}小友！¤Take care of yourself {FirstName} little friend!
破！¤Shatter!
冷静点红莲，现在出手对我们不利。¤Calm down Red Lotus, it's not in our interest to strike now.
这老怪物...居然真的还活着？¤This old monster... Is it true that he is still alive?
他快不行了，一起上！¤He's dying, let's go!
{vpunch=10,0.5}给我破！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}Shatter before me!
这冥蛛神识过于强大，我只能勉强压制它，得靠你出手对它造成致命的一击了！¤This ghost spider is too powerful, I can only reluctantly suppress it, and I have to rely on you to deal a fatal blow to it!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你那边好像还挺棘手的，不过放心，我这边撑得住。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, your side seems to be quite tricky, but don't worry, I can hold it here.
该死的，这个毒气也太强了。{FirstName}{xiongdi}，不过我还能撑一会。¤Damn, this poison gas is too strong too. {FirstName}{xiongdi}, but I can hold out for a while.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我撑不住了！快动手！¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, I can't hold it anymore! Get started!
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，我这边有点麻烦，你可能要多撑一会了。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, I have a little trouble here, you may have to hold on for a while.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你还活着吗，我可能还需要一点时间。¤{FirstName}{xiongdi}, are you still alive, I may need a little more time.
{vpunch=10,0.5}{FirstName}{xiongdi}，就是现在！动手吧！¤{vpunch=10,0.5}{FirstName}{xiongdi}, it’s now! Let’s do it!
不过我的秘术应该能帮你多撑一会！¤But my secret technique should be able to help you hold on for a while!
风雨楼的人？¤Someone from Storm manor?
（先交手几个回合，假装不敌，看看那琚运琦到底想干什么...）¤(Let's fight for a few rounds and pretend to be defeated to see what Ju Yunqi is up to...)
我现下没有什么需要你帮助的事。¤I don't have anything that needs your help right now.
城内戒备森严，真要动起手来，引来了守卫，再想脱身可就不容易了...¤The city is heavily guarded. I really want to start and attract the guards. It won't be easy to get out anymore...
门派内戒备森严，直接在这里动手了恐怕只有死路一条...¤The sect is heavily guarded, I am afraid there is only a dead end if you start directly here...
天机阁戒备森严，若是在这里直接动手被人发现，恐怕难以脱身...¤The Heavens Secrets Pavilion is heavily guarded. If someone finds out directly here, I'm afraid it will be difficult to get out...
岛上戒备森严，真要动起手来，引来了守卫，再想脱身可就不容易了...¤The island is heavily guarded. I really want to start and attract the guards. It won't be easy to get out again...
东石谷人多眼杂，还有各大家族的门人维持秩序，在此动手风险颇大...¤There are many people in East Stone Valley, and the clans of various big families maintain order. It is quite risky to do it here...
还是不要在这里动手了...¤Don't do it here...
我的确遇到了一些麻烦。此番我{$TmpTalkString}{$TmpStrValue}。¤I did have some trouble. This time I {$TmpTalkString}{$TmpStrValue}.
没想到这只{$TmpStrValue}的实力远超寻常的{$yaoshoulv}妖兽，我以寻常方式根本拿不下它，还险些命丧于此。¤Unexpectedly, the strength of this {$TmpStrValue} is far beyond the ordinary {$yaoshoulv} monster. I can't hold it in an ordinary way, and I almost lost my life here.
不知你是否愿意出手助我？集我们两人之力，想必拿下这{$TmpStrValue}定然不在话下。当然...事成之后我也会将一部分的报酬分于你。¤I wonder if you are willing to help me? Combining the strength of the two of us, I must win this {$TmpStrValue}. Of course...I will also share part of the reward with you after it's done.
可惜...可惜...那我只能另想办法了。¤It's a pity... a pity... then I can only find another way.
如此甚好！¤It's so good!
{$daoyou}先在此地稍作准备，待我将那{$TmpStrValue}引来，我们再一起出手！¤{$daoyou} first prepare here for a moment, then when I draw that {$TmpStrValue} in, we'll strike together!
我们正准备在城里收购一些的材料，如果运气不差的话，最后我们会在{color=#d0380a}碎星岛{/color}出手这些货物。¤We are preparing to purchase some materials in the city. If we are lucky, we will finally sell these goods on {color=#d0380a}Broken Star Island{/color}.
当然，如果你愿意分担我一部分修理灵舟的费用，大概是{color=#d0380a}{$money}灵石{/color}，我不介意带你一程。一切顺利的话，我想我们会在{color=#d0380a}{$TmpTalkString}{/color}后抵达那里。¤Of course, if you are willing to share part of the cost of repairing the spirit boat, probably {color=#d0380a}{$money}spirit stone{/color}, I don't mind taking you for a ride. If all goes well, I think we'll get there after {color=#d0380a}{$TmpTalkString}{/color}.
哼，此事与你何关？¤Huh, what does this matter to you?
准备好，我们这便要出海了。¤Get ready, we are going to sea now.
不好，被发现了...¤No, it was found...
我们之间的交情似乎还没有这么深吧？¤The friendship between us doesn't seem to be so deep, right?
你还是不要急着拒绝比较好。¤It is better for you not to reject in a hurry.
（就境界而言，我的威胁力还不太够，得尝试一下其他方法...）¤（In terms of realm, my strength is not quite enough, I have to try other methods ...）
（这是他喜好的高品阶物品，我的威胁力还不太够，得尝试一下其他方法...）¤（This is a high quality item of his preference, my threat is not quite enough, have to try other methods...）
你可听说过{$TmpStrValue}强者{$HaoyouId1}?那可是我{$Relation}！识相的话就赶紧交出来。¤Have you ever heard of {$TmpStrValue} the strongest {$HaoyouId1}? That's me {$Relation}! Hand it over if you know what's good for you.
你可听说过{$TmpStrValue}强者{$HaoyouId2}?那可是我{$Relation}！识相的话就赶紧交出来。¤Have you ever heard of {$TmpStrValue} the strongest {$HaoyouId2}? That's me {$Relation}! Hand it over if you know what's good for you.
你可听说过{$TmpStrValue}强者{$HaoyouId3}?那可是我{$Relation}！识相的话就赶紧交出来。¤Have you ever heard of {$TmpStrValue} the strongest {$HaoyouId3}? That's me {$Relation}! Hand it over if you know what's good for you.
这...你是认真的么？¤This... Are you serious?
没有想到我们会走到这一步...¤Didn't think we'd come this far...
既然你执意如此，那你我二人便缘尽于此吧。¤Since you insist on this, you and I will end up here.
我似乎还没有属于自己的洞府...¤I don't seem to have an abode of my own...
好，那我这便出发...¤Good, then I'll set out here...
我希望你能来...¤I hope you can come...
现在不是做这些的时候...¤Now is not the time for this...
{$TmpTalkString}，想起当年在东石谷外与你的相遇，真是恍若隔世。¤{$TmpTalkString}, it's like a lifetime ago when I remembered my encounter with you outside the East Rock Valley.
你经历了这么多才走到今天这一步，可不能在这里倒下了啊！¤You've been through so much to get to this point, you can't afford to fall down here!
咦...{$TmpTalkString}，你是在紧张么？¤Huh... {$TmpTalkString}, are you nervous?
放心吧，以你的实力，一定没有问题的！¤Don't worry, with your strength, you'll have no problem!
只是看着这天劫的威势，我就感到兴奋起来了。¤Just looking at the power of this heavenly calamity made me feel excited.
有朝一日，我定也要与这天斗上一斗！¤One day, I will have to fight with the sky!
{$TmpTalkString}一切可都准备妥当了？¤{$TmpTalkString}Is everything ready?
据我所知，这九道天劫中有一道唤作五行劫，此劫不仅会打乱一方天地灵气，更会让身中此劫者一身灵气完全散尽，极难对付。¤As far as I know, one of the nine heavenly tribulations is called the Five Elements Tribulation. This tribulation will not only disrupt the spiritual energy of the heaven and earth, but will also completely dissipate the spiritual energy of the person who is struck by this tribulation, making it extremely difficult to deal with.
{$TmpTalkString}务必要好好提防。¤{$TmpTalkString}Be sure to be on your guard.
{$TmpTalkString}...我...我会一直在这里陪着你的。¤{$TmpTalkString}... I'm... I'll always be here for you.
你当前的状态为{color=#d0380a}灵思枯竭{/color}，无法获取论道值。确定要开始论道么？¤Your current status is {color=#d0380a}Spiritual Thought Depleted{/color} and you are unable to obtain the value of the Discourse. Are you sure you want to start the argument?

你当前的状态为{color=#d0380a}天人感应{/color}，准备开始此番论道了么？¤Your current status is {color=#d0380a}Celestial {/color}, are you ready to begin this discourse?
清月潭只能进入一次，{shidi}的清月令上已留有印记，{shidi}还是请回吧。¤You can only enter Lake Bright Moon once, and there's already a mark on your Bright Moon Decree, so please return.
清月令无误，不过星河弟子只可进入清月潭一次，{daoyou}要好好珍惜这机缘。¤The Bright Moon Decree is genuine, but disciples of Celestial River are only allowed to enter Lake Bright Moon once, so make the most out of this opportunity ,{daoyou}.
得了你的应允，倪旭欣迫不及待地把丹药揣入怀中。 ¤With your permission, Ni XuXin eagerly stow the pill into his pocket.
你在港口寻找了一圈都没找到先前那个蓬莎修士，想来上次目睹交易纠纷已经是{$yearDiff}年多前的事了，可能他们早就出海了。¤You searched around the harbor but couldn't find the previous Pongsha cultivator you saw during the trading dispute, which had happened more than {$yearDiff}years ago. It's possible that they had already set sail.
你在港口寻找了一圈都没找到先前那个蓬莎修士，想来上次目睹交易纠纷已经是{$monthDiff}个月前的事了，可能他们已经出海了吧。¤You searched around the harbor but couldn't find the previous Pongsha cultivator you saw during the trading dispute, which had happened more than {$monthDiff}months ago. It's possible that they had already set sail.
林沐心还没能理解你的意思，已然被那束寒芒击中。¤Before Lin MuXin could understand what you meant, she was already struck by the cold beam.
这寒芒速度之快，甚至在你想到出言提醒之前就已经离林沐心后脑不过数尺。¤The cold beam was moving so fast that it was only a few feet away from the back of Lin MuXin's head before you could even think to warn her.
你正准备展示自己的阵道领悟时，却瞥见一束寒芒飞刺向毫无防备的林沐心。¤Just as you were about to demonstrate your comprehension of the Dao of Array,  you caught sight of a cold beam of light flying towards the unguarded Lin MuXin.
直到这时你方才看清，那道寒芒竟是一道夹杂着千年冰心石的神识攻击。也难林沐心在猝不及防之下身受重伤。¤It was only then that you could see clearly that the cold beam was actually a soul sense attack enhanced with Millenium Ice Heart Stone. It was no wonder that Lin MuXin was seriously injured when she was caught off guard.
可惜因为其炼制繁杂，算是有价无市。除了各大宗门之外，也就只有我们武陵城灵药堂的丹师才有能力炼制。¤Unfortunately, due to its complicated refining process, it's considered priceless. Apart from the major sects, only the alchemists from our Spirit Herb Hall in Wuling City are capable of refining it.
远处一名弟子眉头紧皱，似是对你之前所讲的内容不甚理解。¤A disciple in the distance frowned, as if he did not quite understand what you had said before.
道友之前对化神这个境界可有了解？¤Fellow Daoist, do you have any previous knowledge of the realm of Deity Transformation?
 不像，若是阵法，这排列的图案应该有迹可循才对……也许去旁边的山顶能看出些端倪。¤It doesn't seem like it. If it were an array, the pattern of this arrangement should give us some clues... Perhaps we can find some clues by going to the mountaintop next to us.
哼，没想到...是你救了我。¤Hmph, I didn't expect... it was you who saved me.''
若非你出手，今日我恐怕便要殒命于此。这些灵石是答谢你的救命之恩，但你我之间的旧怨可不会就这么一笔勾销。¤If it weren't for you, I'm afraid I would have perished here today. These spirit stones are my gratitude for saving my life, but the old grudges between us won't just disappear like that.
（邪魅地）怎么可能？？？ ¤(Evilly) How is that possible???
不必了，顺手而已。¤No need for that, it's no big deal.
{$DaoyouPlayer}可愿与我结为道侣，共求长生大道？¤Would you be willing to become my Daoist partner, {$DaoyouPlayer}, and seek the path to eternal life together?
那好，等我解决了魔修便来支援你。 ¤Alright, I'll come to support you once I have dealt with this evil cultivator.
我说，{xiongdi}你也太厉害了吧，这等赛事，竟能拔得头筹？¤I have to say, {xiongdi}, you're amazing! To win the top spot in this kind of competition is truly impressive!
我记得敖玄道友你曾言令尊当时是在闭关疗伤。¤I remember that Fellow Daoist Ao Xuan said that your father was in seclusion to recover from his injuries at that time.
但如果我也把这个当作一个对弟子的考验，就算你成功战胜了那筑基巅峰妖王，那也只能说明你比他厉害罢了，{$ShiXiongStr}的面子也勉强算是保住了。¤But even if I see this as a test for my disciples, if you can successfully defeat that Beast King at the Foundation Establishment pinnacle, it only means that you're stronger than him. {$ShiXiongStr} can barely save face in this matter.
此前{$ShiXiongStr}不是让他的弟子前去解决嘛？若是我亲自出手解决，岂不是说明{$ShiXiongStr}的决断出了问题？{$ShiXiongStr}素来好面子，这样做他肯定会生气。¤Didn't {$ShiXiongStr} send his disciples to deal with it before? If I were to personally intervene and solve it, wouldn't it mean that his decision was wrong? {$ShiXiongStr} has always cared about his face, so he will definitely be angry if I do that.
灼烧流由于在筑基期可供修习的功法较少，所以主要以神通为主。¤Because there are few Techniques available at the Foundation Establishment stage, cultivators who utilize ''Burn'' mainly focuses on Divine skills.
此前{$ShiXiongStr}手下的弟子前去与之交手了一番，都差点没能活着回来，你还是不要掉以轻心为好。¤Previously, {$ShiXiongStr}'s disciples went to fight it and almost didn't make it back alive, so you shouldn't take it lightly.
{$ShiXiongStr}那暴躁脾气，稀里糊涂的就让徒弟上了。哼，我可不会像他那样。¤{$ShiXiongStr}'s temper is so violent that he sent his disciple without much consideration. Hmph, I won't be like him.
别担心，{$ShiXiongStr}性格直爽，没有弄清楚实力差距而已。不过我可是心里有数。¤Don't worry, {ShiXiongStr} is straightforward and just didn't understand the power gap. But I have a good sense of it.
此前{$ShiXiongStr}手下的弟子前去与之交手了一番，都能活着回来，相信你去应该不是问题。¤Previously, {ShiXiongStr}'s disciples went to fight with it and all came back alive, so I believe it shouldn't be a problem for you to go.
我为了炼制一把武器正在收集材料，而这材料倒也不是非要蓬莎巨蟹螯，是要天阳、水属性的四品材料，另外也最好是牙、骨类的。¤I'm currently gathering materials to forge a weapon, and it doesn't have to be Pongsha crab claws. I need fourth-grade materials with the attributes of Yang and Water, and preferably teeth or bone materials.
啊！且不说这些了，{$daoyouPlayer}为何这么想要蓬莎巨蟹螯呢？¤Oh, never mind that. Why do you want Pongsha crab claws so badly, {$daoyouPlayer}?
既然{$daoyouPlayer}这么说了，那就还是按正常价格吧。¤Since {$daoyouPlayer} has said so, then let's stick to the normal price.
她眨巴着眼睛看着你，眼里充满了期待。¤She blinked her eyes at you, full of anticipation.
好，我且帮你去打探一下吧。¤Alright, I'll help you inquire about it.
想不到你也坐地起价，我真是看错你了！¤I didn't expect you to hike up the price. I misjudged you!
正是如此，我是要向他们购买蓬莎巨蟹螯。¤That's right, I want to buy Pongsha crab claws from them.
算是一点心意，{$daoyouPlayer}不必客气了。¤It's just a little token of my appreciation, {$daoyouPlayer}, no need to be polite.
而地阴、水属性材料对应着【{color=#d0380a}疗{/color}】的效果，虽不影响成器，但阴阳相斥，混着来则两边的灵力都会被浪费不少。¤Materials with attributes of Yin and Water correspond to the effect of 【{color=#d0380a}Heal{/color}】. Although it doesn't affect the crafting process, as Yin and Yang repel each other, mixing them together will waste a lot of spiritual power on both sides.
{$daoyouPlayer}也许有些误会，其实他们蓬莎岛修士也不隶属于什么商会，而是个散修组织，谈不上垄断海外材料的贸易。¤{$daoyouPlayer} may have some misunderstandings. In fact, the Pongsha Island cultivators do not belong to any Merchant guild, but rather a loose organization of independent cultivators, and they do not monopolize the trade of overseas materials.
我们既是同门，这材料{$daoyouPlayer}就不必客气了。¤Since we are fellow disciples, you don't need to be so polite about taking this material, {$daoyouPlayer}.
不过我也听说，蓬莎修士之间也经常以物易物，没准可以用他们需要的物品换取你想要的材料呢。¤But I also heard that Pongsha cultivators often exchange goods with each other. Maybe you can exchange the materials you want with what they need.
为了弄到这蓬莎巨蟹螯，我还是费了些精力和财力，还请{$daoyouPlayer}多付些灵石。只要多付平价的一半就可以了，这已经比原来便宜不少了吧。¤I had to spend some effort and money to get these Pongsha crab claws, so please pay more spirit stones, {$daoyouPlayer}. Just pay half of the fair price, which is already much cheaper than before.
这四品材料大多是从金丹妖兽身上产出，都主要靠金丹以上修士猎杀得来，这可不是件简单的差事啊。¤Most of these fourth-grade materials are produced from the bodies of Golden Core Spirit Beasts, and they are mainly hunted by cultivators above Golden Core. This is not a simple task.
真是不好意思，让{$daoyou}听了我这么多抱怨。¤I'm sorry for complaining so much to you, {$daoyou}.
我这些日子就要赶回神兵阁炼制武器去，{$daoyou}替我找来的材料我一定好好使用。¤I have to hurry back to the Divine Weapon Pavilion to refine the weapon with the materials you've found for me, and I will make good use of them.
既然{$daoyou}这么说，我愿意相信{$daoyou}是为了保本。那好，我就多付些灵石，谢谢{$daoyou}帮忙。¤Since you say so, I'm willing to believe that you're just trying to break even. Okay, I'll pay more spirit stones. Thank you for your help, {$daoyou}.
是啊，你说气不气人，他们海外修士，就是倚靠着商会，向宁州高价倾销材料，弄得大家都买不起了。¤It's really frustrating that these overseas cultivators rely on the Merchant guild to sell their materials at high prices in Ning Province, making it impossible for everyone to afford them.
那有劳{$daoyou}了！¤Thank you for your help, {$daoyou}!
为了这蓬莎巨蟹螯，我可是煞费精力，而且据说现在这广陵城只有这一份蓬莎巨蟹螯了，这价格我就和港口那些修士看齐了。¤I put a lot of effort into getting this Pongsha Crab Claw. I heard that this is the only Pongsha Crab Claw left in Guangling City. At this price, it will be the same as what those cultivators in the port are selling for.
{$daoyouPlayer}收集材料不易，这东西我就赠与你吧。¤Collecting materials is not easy, so I'll give this to you as a gift, {$daoyouPlayer}.
哎，我的灵石也不多，大多材料都是尽量自己猎杀妖兽或者在坊市购买，听说广陵城港口能买到海外金丹妖兽的材料，才想来碰碰运气，没想到这价格这么黑！¤Oh, I don't have many spirit stones as well. I gathered most of the materials myself from hunting Spirit Beasts or buy them in the market. I heard that the port of Guangling City sells materials from overseas Golden Core Spirit Beasts, so I came to try my luck, but I didn't expect the price to be so high!
唉，早知道刚才多问两句的。可这样一来，恐怕不能再从他们那儿弄到材料了。¤If only I had asked more questions earlier. But now, I'm afraid I won't be able to get any more materials from them.
其实确切一点，应该说是怕海，看到这一望无际的海面，深不见底的海水，想想都可怕吧。而且，这片凶恶的海...¤Actually, to be more precise, it's a fear of the sea. Just the sight of the endless expanse of water, the unfathomable depths, is terrifying. Moreover, this treacherous sea...
不过刚才在港口看{$daoyouPlayer}的反应，似乎无法出海亲自去收集材料，莫非是有什么难言之隐？¤But judging from {$daoyouPlayer}'s reaction just now, it seems that she is unable to go out to collect the materials herself. Could there be some untold reason behind this?
哪里哪里，我也只是懂些皮毛，而且，凑不到这最后一块材料，我也只能纸上谈兵。¤Oh no, I only have some surface-level knowledge. Besides, I can't get my hands on that last piece of material, so I can only talk about it in theory.
{$daoyou}不用客气了，我还是半价卖给你吧。¤Don't worry about it, {$daoyou}. I'll sell it to you at half price.
那就请倪兄引路了。¤Then please lead the way, Brother Ni.
涵虚仙人成名火属性地阶上品剑阵，《炙炎三才阵》。¤Immortal Hanxu's famous fire-attribute Earth grade sword array, the Scorching Flame Array.
我听说这南崖城是由蓬莎岛，碎星商会和各大家族所共同管理的，而且每隔数百年便会依照一套复杂的规则重新从各势力中进行选拔，组成长老会。¤I heard that South Cliff City is jointly managed by the Pongsha Island, the Merchant Guild, and the major families. And every few hundred years, a set of complex rules are used to select members from various factions to form the Elder Council.
听说{color=#d0380a}碎星岛{/color}有不少了不得的功法传承，碎星商会所举办的拍卖会上也是珍宝如云，我们便先去那里见识一番吧！¤I heard that {color=#d0380a}Shattered Star Island{/color} has many powerful technique legacies, and the auction held by the Merchant Guild is also full of treasures. Let's go there first to take a look!
噢？看来道友对此还不知情。碎星商会的人常常会在这附近的海岛上开设一些临时的交易场所，收购草药和丹药。¤Oh? It seems that you don't know about this yet, Fellow Daoist. The people of the Merchant Guild often set up temporary trading places on the nearby islands to purchase herbs and pills.
在当年金虹剑仙一剑开天，引来雷劫以前，可从未有人引来天劫，飞升到过上界。但如今，只要踏足这化神之境，天劫便会在千年后如期降临...¤Before Immortal Radiant Sword split the sky in half and summoned a Lighting Tribulation, no one had ever attracted it or ascended to the Upper World. But now, as long as you step into the Deity Transformation realm, the Lighting Tribulation will arrive as scheduled a thousand years later...
你能来...我很高兴...¤I'm glad you came...
你向半空中的身影望去，正对上{$name}坚定的目光。千年修为，只为今朝，你能感受到{$ta}对上界的向往。¤You look up at the figure in mid-air and meet {$name}'s resolute gaze. A thousand years of cultivation, just for this moment. You can feel {$ta}'s yearning for the Upper World.
{$TmpTalkString}，日后有缘，上界再见。¤{$TmpTalkString}, we'll meet again in the future in the Upper World.
第八道雷劫轰然落下，早就摇摇欲坠的灵气护罩一触即溃，{$name}再也支撑不住，被落雷淹没...¤The eighth lighting Tribulation falls, and the already precarious spiritual shield collapses upon contact. {$name} can no longer hold on and is engulfed by the lightning...
再见了...¤Farewell...
千年修为，只为今朝，我相信你可以的！¤Millennia of cultivation, all for this moment. I believe in you!
你看到{$name}找了一片空旷的开阔地，正在养精蓄锐，静心准备渡劫。¤You see that {$name} has found a spacious area and is preparing for their tribulation with intense focus.
{$TmpTalkString}，谢谢你能来。¤{$TmpTalkString}, thank you for coming.
劫云渐渐散去，阳光重新穿过云层，洒下道道光柱。但光柱之下，却空无一人...¤As the tribulation clouds gradually disperse, the sun shines through the clouds and casts beams of light. But under the light, there is no one to be found...
凭我这十方御劫阵，今日一定可以...¤With my Tribulation Omniguard Array, I will definitely...
{$TmpTalkString}，保重！¤{$TmpTalkString}, take care!
相持许久，灵气护罩终于被击溃，{$name}再也支撑不住，被落雷淹没...¤After a long struggle, the spiritual shield is finally shattered and {$name} can no longer hold on, engulfed by thunder...
{$name}仅有化神中期修为，在连绵不绝的雷劫下很快便有些支撑不住，险象环生...¤With only a mid-stage Deity Transformation cultivation, {$name} can barely withstand the endless waves of tribulation, and the situation is dire...
纵使明白天道无情，但想起与{$name}相识的点点滴滴，一时间仍让你有些难以接受...¤Even though you understand that the path toward immortality is merciless, you still find it hard to accept when you think of all the moments you shared with {$name}...
即便你已经在现场见证了师兄白帝飞升的情景，此时在这煌煌天威之下还是不禁为{$name}捏了一把汗。¤Even though you have witnessed Senior Brother White Emporer's ascension, you can't help but feel nervous for {$name} in the face of this magnificent Heavenly might.
很多年没有这种感觉了...只是看着这天劫的威势，我就感到兴奋起来了。¤It's been many years since I've felt this way... Just looking at the power of this heavenly tribulation made me feel excited.
这一天...我等了很久了...¤This day... I've waited a long time...
我明白。¤I understand.
别紧张，我会一直在这里陪着你。¤Don't be nervous, I'll be here with you all the way.
终究...还是失败了么...¤After all... did it still fail...
你向半空中的身影望去，正对上{$name}兴奋的目光，你能感受到{$ta}难以抑制的激动心情。¤You look up at the figure in the sky, meeting {$name}'s excited gaze, and you can feel {$ta}'s difficult-to-control excitement.
最后一道雷劫轰然落下，暗红色的雷柱重重的砸在灵气护罩上，爆发出耀眼的闪光。翻涌的灵气四散开来，让你很难看清劫云中心到底发生了什么...¤The last thunder tribulation falls with a bang, the dark red thunder pillar smashing heavily against the spiritual shield, erupting into a dazzling flash. The surging spiritual energy scatters, making it difficult for you to see what happened in the center of the tribulation cloud...
轰！！！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤Boom!!! {vpunch=10,0.5}
你向半空中的身影望去，正对上{$name}有些平静的目光。仙凡两隔，自此以后，{$ta}与这下界便再也没有瓜葛了。¤You look up at the figure in mid-air, meeting {$name}'s somewhat calm gaze. Immortals and mortals are separated, and from now on, {$ta} and the mortal world have nothing to do with each other.
第一道雷劫应声落下，紧随而来的是第二，第三道...¤The first thunder tribulation falls in response, followed by the second, third...
{$TmpTalkString}...你说上界会是什么样子的呢？¤{$TmpTalkString}... What do you think the upper world will be like?
嘻嘻...刚刚还在想，你什么时候来呢。¤Hehe... I was just thinking, when will you come?
但若没有这天劫桎梏，本宫倒也未必真就想飞升去那上界。¤But if it weren't for the constraints of this heavenly tribulation, I might not really want to ascend to that upper world.
{$TmpTalkString}，想起当年在东石谷外与你的相遇，真是恍若隔世...¤{$TmpTalkString}, thinking back to our encounter outside Dongshi Valley that year, it feels like a lifetime ago...
{$name}已有化神后期修为，面对一道道落下的雷劫虽说不上轻松，但尚可勉力支撑。¤{$name} has already reached the late stage of deity transformation, and although it is not easy to face a falling thunderstorm, they can still withstand it.
你向半空中的身影望去，正对上{$name}有些哀伤的目光，不由得心中一颤...{$ta}是在为这离别而感到悲伤么？¤You look up at the figure in the sky, meeting {$name}'s somewhat sorrowful gaze. Your heart can't help but tremble... is {$ta} feeling sad about this parting?
伴随着阵阵低沉的雷鸣之声，天色骤然暗了下去，仅仅几息之间，几乎小半个宁州的天空都被漆黑的劫云笼罩。¤Accompanied by the low rumble of thunder, the sky suddenly darkens. In just a few breaths, almost half of Ning Province's sky is covered by pitch-black tribulation clouds.
天劫共有九道，每道各不相同。但归根结底，不管用什么手段，只要能活着扛过雷劫，便可得道飞升。¤There are nine tribulations in total, each one different from the others. But ultimately, no matter what method is used, as long as one can survive the tribulations, they can achieve ascension.
太好了...¤Great...
最后一道雷劫轰然落下，暗红色的雷柱与重重的砸在灵气护罩上，而护罩之下，只见{$name}的脸色愈发苍白，嘴角也沁出血迹。¤The last tribulation thundered down, the dark red thunder pillar heavily crashing onto the spiritual shield. Under the shield, {$name}'s face turned even paler and blood seeped out at the corner of {$ta} lips.
化神寿命亦有尽时...即便没有天劫，面对终将耗尽的寿元，岂不是更加绝望。¤The life of a deity transformation cultivator will also come to an end, even without the tribulation. Isn't it more despairing to face this eventual demise?
{$TmpTalkString}，看着吧。看我是如何破开这雷劫，飞升上界的！¤{$TmpTalkString}, just watch. Watch how I break through this tribulation and ascend to the Upper World!
天劫不可小觑，你可别大意了。¤The heavenly tribulation is not to be underestimated, so don't be careless.
这些年来要不是你数次在危难关头帮我，我也无法走到今天这一步。¤If it weren't for your help several times in the past, I wouldn't have made it this far.
{$TmpTalkString}不必为我担心，我知道该怎么做。¤{$TmpTalkString}, don't worry about me, I know what to do.
不用为我担心，我不会有事的。¤Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
再见了，{$TmpTalkString}...¤Goodbye, {$TmpTalkString}...
本宫化神千年，游遍人间，在这下界原本应该已经没有什么可留恋的东西了...¤I have been in the deity transformation stage for a thousand years, wandering the mortal world. There should be nothing left for me to miss in this lower world...
{$name}仅有化神初期修为，在连绵不绝的雷劫下很快便有些支撑不住，险象环生...¤With only an early-stage Deity Transformation cultivation, {$name} can barely withstand the endless waves of tribulation, and the situation is dire...
嗯...奇怪。原本我还有些紧张的，不过看到你来了以后，好像就安心了不少。¤Hmm... how strange. I was feeling a bit nervous earlier, but I feel much more at ease now that you're here.
你今日...似乎和往常不太一样。¤You seem.... a little bit different today.
劫云渐渐散去，万道光柱穿破云层，在光柱的正中心，能够清晰的看到一个身影正缓缓向上飞去...¤As the tribulation clouds gradually dissipated, countless beams of light pierced through the clouds. At the center of the light, you could clearly see a figure slowly ascending into the sky...
这是你第一次在现场见证化神强者飞升的情景，在这煌煌天威之下，你不禁为{$name}捏了一把汗。¤This is your first time witnessing the scene of a Deity Transformation cultivator ascending to the divine realm in person. Under this magnificent heavenly might, you couldn't help but worry for {$name}.
嘻嘻...我只等着这雷劫有些不耐烦了而已。¤Hehe... I was just getting a bit impatient waiting for the thunder tribulation.
{$TmpTalkString}，我成功了！¤{$TmpTalkString}, I did it!
除你以外，还有不少修士被这里的天地异象所吸引。但他们不敢靠近，只能远远的围观。¤In addition to you, many other cultivators were also attracted by the extraordinary phenomenon here. But they dare not approach and can only watch from afar.
成功了！¤Success!
青玉符剑-主动：吸收1点灵气。冷却时间2回合。\n¤Green Jade Rune Sword - Active: Absorbs 1 point of Qi. Cooldown: 2 rounds.
驱火剑-主动：造成6点火系伤害。冷却时间1回合。¤Fire Quenching Sword - Active: deals 6 points of fire damage. Cooldown 1 round.
火铜符剑-主动：敌方获得【灼烧】*2。冷却时间2回合。¤Fire Copper Rune Sword - Active: Enemy gains 【Burn】*2. Cooldown 2 rounds.
我们碎星商会收购这些东西也有不小的成本，你能用这样的价格买到已经很不错了，若是到其它城市里的拍卖行买，那可要贵多了。¤We at the Shattered Star Merchant Guild have to pay a high price to purchase these items. You're already getting a good deal at this price. If you were to buy them from an auction house in another city, they would be much more expensive.
你可以试着先依照功法运转一下，在运转的过程中试着领悟，领悟不出来的话，可以去打听打听，看看其他人都有什么见解。¤You can try to run the technique first, and then try to comprehend it during the process. If you can't comprehend it, you can ask around and see what other people think.
...夫剑者，心中有剑，万法皆可为剑，或生生不息，或厚积薄发，或行走偏锋，或贵于神速。不拘泥于形，不凝滞于物。¤...Sword cultivators, with a sword in their heart, can make use of all things as a sword, giving rise to endless possibilities. They can attack relentlessly, build up power, take unconventional approaches, value speed above all else. They are not bound by form, nor restrained by matter.
这功法...着实精妙...连老夫我一时间都看不透，不过可以确定，肯定是举世罕见的剑修功法。¤This cultivation technique... is truly a masterpiece... even I, an old master, cannot fully comprehend it. However, I can tell for sure that it is an extremely rare sword cultivation technique.
这运气之法看似平常，与五行剑法相匹配后居然如此精妙...果然是前代能人才有的手笔！¤This technique of channeling Qi may seem ordinary, but when combined with the Five Elements Sword Techniques, it becomes so elegant... truly the work of a remarkable master of old!
来到高高的白玉石台之下，最显眼的便是陈长老的告天下剑修书。¤Arriving at the towering white jade platform, the most conspicuous thing is Elder Chen's book ''Announcement to all Sword Cultivators.''
不管怎么讲，能够重续五行剑诀道统，也算是你一桩机缘，得好好把握才行，咱们走吧。¤In any case, being able to revive the Five Elements Sword Art lineage is an opportunity for you to seize. Let's move on.
......你仔细阅览了一下，玉简中是一部五行运气之法，署名是金虹剑派大长老，名字已无法辨认。¤......You carefully read through the jade slip, and it turns out to be a technique of channeling the Qi of the five Elements. It is signed by the Elder of the Radiant Sword Sect, but the name is no longer legible.
你循着功法运气，慢慢地感觉到一股幽远玄妙的感觉，却难以言表，总觉得缺了些什么，绞尽脑汁地进行领悟，却依旧是一无所获。¤As you practice the technique, you slowly feel a profound and intangible sensation, difficult to put into words. You feel as though something is missing, and you rack your brain to try to comprehend it, but to no avail.
老夫坦荡一生，无悔无愧，只可惜未能亲身运转此功法，实乃大憾，若有有缘者获取此法，集齐...【残缺】五种神通，则自可运转此功，若此功当真有效，则我死而瞑目矣...¤I have lived an honest and upright life, with no regrets or shame. It is just a pity that I was not able to personally practice this technique, truly a great regret. If someone with fate is able to obtain this technique and gather the five 【Incomplete】 divine skills, then they will be able to practice this technique. If this technique is truly effective, then I can rest in peace...
这功法...着实精妙...你可以试着先依照功法运转一下，在运转的过程中试着领悟，领悟不出来的话，可以去打听打听，看看其他人都有什么见解。¤This technique... It's really elegant...You can try to run the technique first, and then try to comprehend it during the process. If you can't comprehend it, you can ask around and see what other people think.
不错，这回你也算是出了个大风头。不过话说回来，这功法还是当真有趣，但想要发挥最大的战斗力，估计还有很长一段路要走，是否要加以使用，还需要深思熟虑才行。¤Not bad, this time you really made a big splash. However, speaking of which, this technique is really interesting, but it seems there is still a long way to go if you wish to utilize its maximum power. Whether to use it or not requires careful consideration.
陈某不才，忝列白帝楼长老之位。数十年前，机缘巧合之下获得此功。¤I am just a humble Elder of the White Emperor Pavilion. Several decades ago, I obtained this technique by chance.
果然如此......看来啊，是功夫未到，机缘未至，不可强求啊。¤That's true... it seems that the level of cultivation is not sufficient and the opportunity has not arrived, you can't force it.
没错，我刚才运转的时候就感觉到了，要不是此处灵力充沛，我运转这功法绝对没有那么轻松，战时能发挥多少实力，还是未知数。¤That's right, when I was practicing just now, I could feel it. If the spiritual energy here wasn't so abundant, it wouldn't have been so easy for me to practice this technique. It's still unknown how much power I can unleash in battle though.
陈道友谬赞了，在下不过是运气好罢了。¤You flatter me, it was just luck on my part.
陈长老察觉到此处的异象，迫不及待地赶来，满眼之中尽是欣喜之色。¤Elder Chen noticed the anomaly here and rushed over eagerly, his eyes full of joy.
...故取五行之气相生之理，化为剑用，得此要者，必能厚积薄发，克敌制胜，若精通五行之道，更能生生不息，绵绵不绝。¤... Therefore, taking the principle of the Synergy of the five elements, it can be applied to swords. Those who comprehend it will be able to accumulate power steadily and overcome their enemies, and if they master the Synergy of the five elements, they can have it their way endlessly and continue without end.
确实奇特，也不知道该如何领悟为妙。¤Peculiar indeed, and not sure how to comprehend it.
已经领悟过一遍了，咱们就别逗留了吧。¤You have already understood it once, let's not linger anymore.
......你阅览了一下这篇告示，后面基本都是陈长老对这篇功法的介绍，可真是玄乎其玄。¤...You read through this notice and the rest of it is basically Elder Chen's introduction of this technique, which is truly mysterious.
厚积薄发，路过的修士皆被你磅礴的剑意所深深震慑，甚至不敢直视，只有高境界的剑修才敢上前一探，他们神情各异，但相通之处便是眼中都闪烁着兴奋的光芒。¤With years of accumulation, your sword intent has absolutely astonished passing cultivators, who dare not even look at you directly. Only high-level sword cultivators dare to approach, with excitement shining in their eyes.
你深吸一口气，缓缓将剑脱鞘，缓缓运转玉简内的运气之法，屏息凝神，身体内似有一股温润的冲动在引导着你，你不知不觉地施展起了五行剑法之神通。¤You take a deep breath and slowly unsheathe your sword, gradually running the technique in the jade slip, holding your breath and focusing your mind. Your body seems to be guided by a warm impulse, and you start to unconsciously display the Divine skill of the Five Elements Sword.
原来是这样，没想到其他三派的名不见经传的剑法，配合起来，竟还有这样的神通！！！¤So that's how it is, I didn't expect that the little-known sword techniques of the other three sects, when combined, could produce such a divine skill!!!
吾素善阵、气之道，偶得此阵之图，观其精微，查其至理，模仿阵中气机运转，耗费毕生心血，创立此功，取名五行剑诀，然吾于...【残缺】一战中，困于此地，修为尽失。¤I have always been good at the Dao of arrays and Qi. I happened to obtain the design this array , studied its subtleties, and imitated the flow of Qi in the array. After spending all my effort, I created this technique, named the Five Elements Sword Art. However, in the battle of...[the missing part], I was trapped here, and lost all my cultivation.
原来如此...这就是五行剑诀吗，当真是精妙绝伦。只是不知临战之时，有没有时间和机会让你运转足够多的五行灵气了。¤So this is the Five Elements Sword Art, truly elegant. I just wonder if you will have enough time and opportunity to run enough Qi of the Five Elements in a battle.
好！好！好！道友真是了结了在下平生一大夙愿！¤Good! Good! Good! My fellow Daoist, you have fulfilled one of my lifelong wishes!''
好，正合我意。¤Good, that's just what I wanted.
陈长老诚恳地向你请教了五行剑诀的相关要点。你领悟五行剑诀的事迹很快传遍了整个宁州，为天下剑修所津津乐道。¤Elder Chen sincerely asked you for advice on the key points of the Five Elements Sword Art. Your understanding of the Five Elements Sword Art quickly spread throughout Ning Province and became the talk of the town among sword cultivators throughout the world.
没想到啊没想到，这五派剑法看似平常，结合起来居然有如此威能，这作者的确是天才。¤I didn't expect it, I didn't expect it. These five Sword Arts seem ordinary, but combined, they have such power. The inventor is indeed a genius.
...五行剑诀，当真是...名副其实，厉害非常！¤...The Five Elements Sword Art, truly lives up to its name, very powerful!
一股难以置信的力量牵引着你，\r配合着剑花飞舞，五行之力生生不息，剑气剑意绵绵不绝，手中之剑轻若无物，力道却重似千钧。¤An unbelievable force pulls you along, accompanied by the dancing of sword flowers. The power of the Five Elements is endless, and the sword Qi and intent are endless. The sword in your hand is as light as a feather, but the force is as heavy as a thousand pounds.
一个古朴的玉简在阵法的加持下悬浮于石台之上，借助阵法，每个人都可以自行阅读。¤An ancient jade scroll is suspended on the stone platform under the support of an array. With the help of the array, everyone can read it on their own.
原来这五行剑诀，需要五派剑法相互搭配才能使用。离火、竹山、化尘三派剑法千百年来，一直被人所忽视，能集齐这五派剑法，道友可真是不简单啊！¤It turns out that the Five Elements Sword Art requires the combination of the sword arts from the five sects. The sword techniques of of Heavenly Fire Gate, Bamboo Mountain Sect, and Shifting Sands School have been overlooked for thousands of years. To be able to gather all the sword arts from the five sects, my fellow Daoist, you are really something!
感觉...好奇怪，到底缺了什么呢？¤It feels... So strange, what's missing?
本功脱胎于...【残缺】，相传魔道入侵之时，为抵御外敌，古金虹掌门结合...【残缺】剑法创立...【残缺】授于其余各三宗，若结为阵法，则可将五行之力化为剑用，然三宗善剑法者鲜，无人能驭，故废之。¤This technique originated from... [Incomplete]. Legend has it that when the demonic clans invaded, the former leader of the Radiant Sword Sect combined... [Incomplete] sword technique to create... [Incomplete] and taught it to the other three sects. If they form an array, they can turn the power of the Five Elements into swords. However, there were few sword experts in the three sects, and no one could master it, so it was abandoned.
玉简上用古修文字写着五行剑诀四个大字，经文内容虽全部是古文字，但好在以你和魏老的阅历，阅读起来并没有什么障碍。¤On the jade slip, there were four big characters ''Five Elements Sword Art'' written in the script used by ancient cultivators. Although the entire text was written in ancient characters, it was fortunate that with your and Senior Wei's experience, there were no obstacles to reading it.
看似稀松寻常，实则幽远玄妙，在下才疏学浅，苦思数年仍未能领悟，今日公之于众，邀天下剑修共同参悟，望有能者为其解密，使古代剑修之道统续存于今。¤It may seem ordinary at first glance, but it is actually profound and mysterious. As someone with limited knowledge and understanding, I have been pondering it for years without success. Today, I am sharing it with everyone, inviting sword cultivators from all over the world to study it together. I hope that someone with the ability will decipher it, so that the legacy of ancient swordsmanship can continue to exist in the present.
此功名曰五行剑诀，乃宁州古迹中金虹剑派大长老所遗，其撰者名氏，今已不存。¤This technique is called the ''Five Elements Sword Art.'' It was left behind by the Grand Elder of the Radiant Sword Sect in the Ning Province Ancient Ruin. The name of the author who wrote this technique is no longer known.
星河剑法、竹山剑法、离火剑法、化尘剑法、金虹剑法...水、木、火、土、金...周而复始、环而无端。¤Celestial River Sword Art, the Bamboo Mountain Sword Art, the Heavenly Fire Sword Art, the Shifting Sand Sword Art, and the Radiant Sword Art... Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal... the cylce repeats itself and is endless.
有点意思...咱们再看看功法经文的内容吧。¤That's interesting... Let's take a look at the contents of the Technique's scripture again.
我去，这啥啊？{xiongdi}你什么时候背着我偷偷学的，这么厉害，快教教我！！！¤What the hell is this? {xiongdi}, when did you learn this secretly behind my back? So good! Please teach me!!!
{FirstName}道友，目前没有更多关于图南漩涡的消息告诉你了。  ¤{FirstName} Daoist, currently there is nothing more to tell you about the South Tu Whirlpool.
{$daoyouPlayer}误会，我只是正巧路过听到了你们争吵而已。请问你们可是专门卖这些海外材料的？¤That was a misunderstanding. I just happened to be passing by and overheard you arguing. May I ask if you specialize in selling these overseas materials?
{$daoyou}又有何事啊？¤What's the matter again, {$daoyou}?
这具体怎么定就是因人而异了，只要两边谈妥了就行。¤It depends on the individual, as long as the two sides agree on a deal.
我数数...不对啊，这补天芝还少一株呢，{$daoyou}还是凑齐了再来吧。¤Let me count...Hold on, you're still missing one stalk of Skymend Shroom, so {$daoyou} should probably come back when you have all ten.
这种草药反倒是宁州独有，我们正准备拿来炼制一些丹药。你要是能拿来10株补天芝，我们便可以用蓬莎巨蟹螯和你交换。¤This kind of herb is unique to Ning Province, and we're planning to use it to refine some pills. If you can bring us 10 stalks of Skymend Shrooms, we can trade Pongsha Crab Claws with you for them.
嘿嘿，正好10株，{$daoyou}收好这蟹螯。¤Good, exactly 10 stalks of them, {$daoyou} can keep these Crab Claws.
嗯...以{$daoyou}显露出来的修为，去海上闯一闯应该不是什么难事，不过还是要十分小心。即便是身经百战的蓬莎到修士出海，仍有舟毁人亡的风险，这种事我们见得太多了。¤Hmm... With {$daoyouPlayer}'s cultivation level, it shouldn't be too difficult to venture out to sea, but one must be extremely careful. Even for the experienced Pongsha cultivators, there's still a risk of lives being lost. We've seen too many incidents like that.
我想想...应该只有{color=#d0380a}南崖城{/color}的坊市了吧，不过南崖城离这儿最远，要从这里出海一路{color=#d0380a}南下{/color}，穿过两三个海域，为此跑一趟太耗时。¤Let me think... The only market for these materials is probably in {color=#d0380a}South Cliff City{/color}, but it's the furthest from here. You'll need to sail {color=#d0380a}south{/color} from here, through two or three seas, which would take too much time.
这就是我们蓬莎岛上经常干的“以物易物”了，{$daoyou}有机会去蓬莎岛啊，得先多准备些好东西，好去交换嘛。¤This is what we often do on Pongsha Island - ''bartering goods for goods.'' If {$daoyou} ever has a chance to go to Pongsha Island, make sure to prepare plenty of good items to trade.
我看{$daoyou}现在修为尚显不足，还是好好修炼，离出海还早着呐。¤I think {$daoyou} is still lacking in your level of cultivation and it's too early to think about going to sea.
之前与{$daoyouPlayer}约好用补天芝换取蓬莎巨蟹螯，这补天芝我带来了。¤I previously made an agreement with {$daoyouPlayer} to trade Skymend Shrooms for Pongsha Crab Claws, and I've brought the Skymend Shrooms with me.
只不过猎杀得来的材料会拿去各地交易，但依然是以个人名义售卖，哪来的什么商会。¤Just that the materials hunted will be traded in different regions, but they are still sold by individuals, there's no merchant guild involved.
他看到你向他走去，警惕地打量着你。¤He sees you walking towards him and looks at you warily.
听前辈这么一解释，这个价格我也只好认了，那有什么办法能便宜点弄到这些材料呢？¤After hearing senpai's explanation, I have no other choice but to accept this price. Is there any way to get these materials cheaper?
哼，今天真是倒霉，刚上岸就和人吵了一架。¤Heck, it's been a bad day, I just got into an argument with someone as soon as I got ashore.
弄到这些草药也颇为麻烦，不如还是直接用灵石买吧。¤Getting these herbs is also quite a hassle, so it is better to just buy them with spirit stones.
海上的妖兽？那自然是海上到处都能碰见，但近海大都是一些实力接近于筑基后期的妖兽，他们身上的材料没啥值钱的.¤Spirit Beasts on the sea? They can be encountered everywhere, but most of the Spirit Beasts near the coast are at a strength close to the late Foundation Establishing stage, and the materials on them are not worth much.
想不到{$daoyou}出手还挺豪爽，那这蓬莎巨蟹螯还是原来讲好的价，总计八千二百二十六灵石。怎么样，{$daoyou}买不买？¤I can't believe {$daoyou} is so generous with your offer. So the price for the Pongsha Crab Claws is still the same as agreed upon, totaling 8,226 spirit stones. What do you say, {$daoyou}, are you buying it?
依我的经验，这时候散修卖得材料大多会比商会卖的便宜一些，你要是运气好啊，这片北宁海没准就会有交易会。¤Based on my experience, materials sold by independent cultivators are usually cheaper than those sold by merchant guilds. If you're lucky, there might be a trade fair in the North Ning Sea.
啊对了，忘了同你说，我们蓬莎岛修士是经常{color=#d0380a}以物易物{/color}的。既然大家所需的东西在别人身上都有，何必再换成灵石折腾一番。¤Oh, I almost forgot to mention, us Pongsha Island cultivators often engage in {color=#d0380a}bartering{/color}. If everyone has what the others need, why bother exchanging it for spirit stones?
现在还是先不换吧。¤Let's not exchange for now.
况且这些东西我们要是便宜着卖给你们，那可就动了他们百里家的财路啦。¤Besides, if we sell these items too cheaply to you, it will hurt the business of the Bai Li family.
不过听说后来在海外惹出什么事，闹过一阵子，价格就差不多稳定到现在这样了，具体的事我也不太清楚，毕竟距离现在有些时间了。¤But I heard there was some trouble overseas later on, and it caused quite a stir. After a while, the prices stabilized to what they are now, but I'm not sure about the specifics as it's been some time since then.
怎么，你也想吵架？¤What, you want to start a fight too?
他说完抬起头四处张望了一下。¤After speaking, he looked around.
到也谈不上专门卖这些，我们只是些散修，比不上那些大商会，不过此番确实是从蓬莎岛特地来广陵城售卖些材料。¤We don't specialize in selling these materials. We are just some independent cultivators, so naturally we can't compare to those big merchant guilds, but we did come to Guangling City from Pongsha Island to sell some materials.
{$daoyou}看看有什么想买的？¤{$daoyou}, take a look and see if there's anything you want to buy?
他摆摆手示意你走近些。¤He waved his hand, motioning for you to come closer.
相比起来，蓬莎岛离这儿就近的多，从广陵城港口出海，一路{color=#d0380a}向东{/color}便能到蓬莎海域了。¤Compared to others, Pongsha Island is much closer. From the Guangling City port, just head {color=#d0380a}east{/color} and you'll reach the Pongsha Sea.
嘿嘿，分文不少，这材料{$daoyou}可收好咯。¤Hehe, that's the right amount. {$daoyou}, take these materials.
最省钱的办法，自然是像我们一样去海上猎杀妖兽，不然呢，就是上蓬莎岛去买，甚至还能去海上的交易会找找嘛。¤Naturally, the most cost-effective way is to hunt Spirit Beasts at sea like we do. Otherwise, you can go to Pongsha Island to buy, or even go to a trade fair at sea.
这些补天芝，分明看着数量不够吧。换不了换不了，{$daoyou}还是凑齐了再来吧。¤There's clearly not enough Skymend Shroom here. No deal. {$daoyou}, come back when you have enough.
你又要来作甚！¤Why are you here again!
时间对于修真者来说很是宝贵，我们散修也就靠着这样来回跑能多挣些灵石，也不能靠着这差事发财。¤As independent cultivators, we rely on traveling back and forth like this to earn more spirit stones, and we can't make a fortune with this.
我好心和你说了这么多，而你转头便要抢我财物，你们宁州人好没良心!¤I kindly told you so much, but you turn around and want to rob me. You peole from Ning Province have no conscience!
动了百里家的财路？此话怎讲。¤Hurting the Bai Li family's business? What do you mean?
不过我看你也算好讲道理，这样吧，我们此番来宁州除了售卖这些货物，还想顺便找些{color=#d0380a}补天芝{/color}。¤But I see that you're also reasonable. How about this, besides selling these goods, we also want to find some {color=#d0380a}Skymend Shrooms{/color} in Ning Province.
除了蓬莎岛，还有哪儿能买到海外的材料？¤Besides Pongsha Island, where else can we buy materials from overseas?
对了，你刚才也瞧见那百里家的少爷了吧。他这一发话，就没人敢闹事了，所以在这广陵城啊，他们百里家才是一手遮天的。¤By the way, you just saw the young master of the Bai Li family, right? As soon as he speaks, no one dares to cause trouble. That's why in Guangling City, they can do whatever they want.
以物易物？那这交换的物品种类和数量如何来定呢？¤Bartering? Then how do we determine the types and quantities of items to be exchanged?
那自然要先准备一艘{color=#d0380a}灵舟{/color}了，海上会碰到一些乱流和风暴，要是没有灵舟的保护就会伤及自身。¤Naturally, we need to prepare a {color=#d0380a}spirit boat{/color} first. There are some turbulence and storms on the sea, so without the protection of a spirit boat, you can get hurt.
（这定价虽然听着像是迫不得已，但细想来，他们的利益也是和百里家绑定了吧。）¤(Even though the pricing sounds like they have no other choice, when you think about it, their interests are also tied to the Bai Li family.)
如此甚好，那{$daoyouPlayer}何时会离开港口？¤That's great, when will you be leaving the port, {$daoyouPlayer}?
{$daoyou}是来交换的吧。¤{$daoyou}, are you here to exchange goods?
去店铺买的好处自然是种类齐全，毕竟也是我们蓬莎修士的主要集散地，所以岛上各种妖兽材料都有得卖。¤Going to a shop has the advantage of having a wide variety of goods, after all, it is the main gathering place for us Pongsha cultivators, so all kinds of materials from various Spirit Beasts on the island are available for sale.
这个嘛，虽然我们船队会等下一个风浪较小的时段才出海，还会多待一些时日，但还望你尽快，这材料指不定会被谁先买走呢。¤Well, although our fleet will wait for a period of time when the waves are smaller before setting sail, so will be staying for a few more days, we still hope you can hurry up, who knows who might buy up the materials before you.
非也非也，{$daoyou}不会不知道我们蓬莎岛吧，我们只是个散修组织，平时组队猎杀些妖兽。¤No, no, {$daoyou}, how could you not know about our Pongsha Island? We are just a loose organization of independent cultivators who usually team up to hunt Spirit Beasts.
今天可真是怪了，怎么现在你也要这玩意儿。但是说好了，我这儿可不能便宜卖给你，价格还是八千多灵石。¤It's really strange today, why do you suddenly want this thing too? But we agreed on the price so I cannot sell it cheaply to you, the price is still over 8,000 spirit stones.
哎，摆摊之余随便聊聊罢了。{$daoyou}将来若是修为长进，也可以出海猎杀些妖兽，到各处去售卖材料嘛。¤Oh, it was just small talk while selling goods. {$daoyou} can also go out to sea to hunt Spirit Beasts and sell materials in the future if your cultivation level improves.
{$daoyou}不像前面那丫头，还是个说得通道理的人。看你也没出过海，那我且告诉你吧。¤Unlike that girl earlier, {$daoyou} is a reasonable person. Since you haven't been out to sea, let me tell you.
你不愿再理会他的咒骂声，扭头便走。¤You turned your head and walked away, unwilling to listen to his curses anymore.
嗨，这些灵石分明不够嘛。¤Hey, these spirit stones are clearly not enough.
这些我都是听说来的啊，可别说是我讲给你听的，惹上什么麻烦我们不负责啊。¤Those are what I heard, but don't say that I told you, we're not responsible if you get into trouble.
海上除了四座较大的岛屿，更多的是一些无人的小岛，不过有时会有碎星商会的人在岛上组织一些交易会，也会有不少散修聚到这些岛上用收集来多的妖兽材料换一些补给。¤Apart from four larger islands, there are many unmanned small islands on the sea. However, the Shatterd Star Merchant Guild sometimes organizes trade fairs on these islands, and many independent cultivators gather here to exchange materials of Spirit Beasts for supplies.
我们这些零散的修士如今也能来港口卖点东西，不过价格还是得和百里家统一的。要是我们海外来的修士降价，大家都买我们的东西了，谁还买他们百里家的呀。¤Nowadays, we scattered cultivators can also sell things in the port, but the prices still have to be unified with the Bai Li family. If we lower our prices as overseas cultivators, everyone will buy our things and nobody would buy from the Bai Li family.
（原先对百里家还不甚了解，今日倒是获得了不少消息，到时候去百里府上拜访可要多留个心眼。）¤(I didn't know much about the Bai Li family before, but I've gained a lot of information today. When I visit the Bai Li mansion later, I have to be careful.)
还有啊，在海上一漂少则几个月，动辄好几年，你要是{color=#d0380a}遁速{/color}不快，恐怕是早晚老死在海上。¤Also, when you're traveling on the sea, it can take a few months or even several years. If your {color=#d0380a}Speed{/color} is not fast enough, you'll probably die at sea sooner or later.
哎哟，连你也来讨价还价？这价格真不算贵了，你可要知道我们从蓬莎海域大老远的跑来，海上至少可是要走一两年的，你算算这花在路上的时间不都是成本？¤Hey, even you want to bargain? This price is not expensive at all. You should know that we came all the way from the Pongsha Sea Region. It takes at least a year or two to travel by sea. Have you calculated the time spent on the road as a cost?
当然蓬莎岛上还有坊市，价格会再便宜些，但找到特定的材料就需碰碰运气了。¤Of course, there are also markets on Pongsha Island where prices can be even cheaper, but you will have to take your chances in finding specific materials.
若你去的是专门售卖材料的店铺，这价格嘛，倒也没便宜到哪儿去，也就相比你在这里买能便宜个两千灵石吧。¤If you go to a shop that specializes in selling materials, the prices won't be much cheaper than here. You might save about two thousand spirit stones compared to buying here.
没多少时日我们便要出海了，{$daoyou}看看还有什么要买的。¤We'll be setting sail soon, {$daoyou}, take a look and see if there's anything else you want to buy.
原来海外还有这种交易的方法，今日多谢{$daoyouPlayer}指点，让我了解诸多海外之事。¤I didn't know there was such a method of trading. Thank you, {$daoyouPlayer}, for enlightening me and letting me learn more about overseas affairs.
不错，此番还算有所收获。刚才你这{xiaozi}还算机灵，要是你把心里话抖搂出来，恐怕此人就没那么好心情跟你说这么多了。¤Not bad, we've gained something this time. That was quite smart of you. If you had revealed what was really on your mind, this person might not have been so willing to share so much with you.
你们既然并非属于商会，那这些材料是否还有些还价的余地？¤Since you are not part of the Merchant Guild, is there still room for negotiation on these materials?
等今日所有的比试结束以后，那边的外门执事会负责你入门的相关事宜。¤After all the competitions are over today, the outer deacon over there will be responsible for your admission-related matters.
潜入公孙府后，几经寻觅得两幢疑似酒窖的建筑。这两处的阵法强度相差无几，只是规模略有不同。 ¤After infiltrating the Gong Sun Mansion, we searched and found two buildings that seem to be wine cellars. The strength of the arrays in these two places is almost the same, but the scale is slightly different.
好，我已神识传音宫主告知{FirstName}{$NickName}将一同前往，有你助力肯定会轻松上不少。 ¤Okay, I have informed the palace master that {FirstName}{$NickName} will be going with us using my soul sense. With your help, it will definitely be much easier.
若要接取任务的话，可以看看那边的告示牌。¤To pick up a quest, check out the bulletin board over there.
这些暂且不多说，还是让老夫来为小友解释一番此前的问题吧。¤Let's put those aside and I'll explain the previous issue for you.
你身为化尘教弟子，出入正阳山，倒也方便。¤As a disciple of the Shifting Sands School, it's convenient for you to come in and out of Mt. Rising Sun.
{size=31}嘿，这玄骨倒也算是个人物。{/size}¤{size=31}Hey, this Xuan Bone is quite a character.{/size}
咦，莫非是{FirstName}道友？在宁州久闻你的名号，今日一见果然不同凡响。¤Oh, could it be Daoist {FirstName}? I've heard of your name for a long time in Ning Province, and seeing you today confirms that you are indeed extraordinary.
天机阁可是堪称神州第一商号了，据说延续已有近万年。上至天才地宝，下到柴米油盐，甚至消息秘闻，无不可以出售。¤Heavens Secrets Pavilion can be regarded as the number one trading organization in the Divine Land, and it is said to have been in existence for nearly ten thousand years. From divine treasures to rice and oil, even secret information, everything can be sold.
碧玉符剑-主动：敌方获得【中毒】*2。冷却时间2回合。¤Jasper Rune Sword - Active: Enemy gains【Poisoned】*2. Cooldown: 2 turns.
陨铁符剑-主动：造成18点剑系伤害，获得【滞气】*5。冷却时间4回合。¤Meteor Iron Rune Sword - Active: deals 18 points of sword damage and gains【Obstructed Qi】*5. Cooldown: 4 turns.
宗门广场上的{color=#d0380a}告示{/color}栏每隔一段时间会发放宗门任务，{shidi}完成任务后便可获得元灵石。¤On the {color=#d0380a}Notice{/color} board at Sect Square, new sect missions will be issued every once in a while, and {shidi} can receive Yuan Ling stones after completing the missions.
慕容颖正在闭目沉思，同行的其他几位弟子正在其周围小声交谈。¤MuRong Ying is pondering with closed eyes, while other fellow disciples around her are whispering.
慕容颖正在闭目沉思，一脸认真投入的样子。¤MuRong Ying is pondering with her eyes closed, looking serious and fully concentrated.
与星河剑法有关...运用五行灵气...嗯，有点意思。¤It's related to the Celestial River Sword Art...using the five-element spiritual energy...hmm, quite interesting.
我虽代表星河剑派受邀带队前来，可惜我本人并不擅长剑法，实在是惭愧非常。¤Although I am here on behalf of the Celestial River Sect, I'm ashamed to say that I am not good at sword techniques myself.
按理说，大部分功法都会有灵根上面的偏好，但这个功法却需要几乎相同数量的五行灵气才行，一旦有误就会彻底中断，真是奇怪非常。¤Normally, most cultivation techniques have preferences in terms of spiritual roots, but this technique requires almost the same amount of five-element spiritual energy. It will not work if there's a slight imbalance, which is really strange.
倒没什么需要藏着掖着的，因为我们还没有什么有意义的发现，各种剑法都尝试过，不过收效却甚微。¤There's nothing to hide, because we haven't made any meaningful discoveries yet. We've tried various sword arts, but the results have been minimal.
{$TmpTalkString}要是有什么头绪，记得及时告诉我们哦！¤Let us know if you have any ideas!
对了，说起五行之道，我倒是确实有个疑惑之处，就是这个运气之法很少见地需要连续运转五种灵气，而且条件非常苛刻。¤Speaking of the Five Elements, I do have a question. The technique requires the continuous operation of five types of spiritual energy, which is very rare and demanding.
五行剑诀，当真是名副其实，{$TmpTalkString}能够领悟，可真是不简单啊！¤The Five Elements Sword Art is truly deserving of its name. It's incredible that {$TmpTalkString} was able to comprehend it!
不过啊，我派各剑法中，唯独这星河剑法对其有反应，这剑法虽是我星河的入门剑法，但其历史是极其悠久，有什么渊源也说不定。¤However, among all the sword techniques in our sect, only the Celestial River Sword Art has a reaction to it. Although it's an entry-level sword technique in our sect, its history is extremely ancient, and it's possible that they share the same origin.
先不打扰她了，星河剑法会和五行剑诀起反应，有点意思，咱们再去问问别人吧。¤The fact that the Celestial River Sword Art reacts to the Five Elements Sword Art is interesting. Let's go ask someone else.
这位道友...打扰了，不知您对此事有何见解？¤Fellow Daoist.. Excuse me, what is your opinion on this matter?
慕容道友，你也到了，不知对此事你怎么看？¤Fellow daoist MuRong, you're here too. What do you think about this?
不劳慕容长老啦，这点小事，我们说就是了，也没什么要藏着掖着的。我们哪，还没有什么有意义的发现。各种方法都试过，但收效却甚微。¤No need to bother Elder MuRong for this small matter. We'll tell you about it, there's nothing to hide. We haven't made any meaningful discoveries yet. We have tried all kinds of methods, but with little success.
慕容颖言语中满是钦佩之意，微笑着用欣赏的眼光看着你。¤MuRong Ying's words were full of admiration, smiling as she looks at you with appreciative eyes.
不过我派各类剑法中，唯独这星河剑法对其有反应，这剑法虽是我星河的入门剑法，但其历史是极其悠久，有什么渊源也说不定。¤However, among all the sword techniques in our sect, only the Celestial River Sword Art has a reaction to it. Although it's an entry-level sword technique in our sect, its history is extremely ancient, and it's possible that they share the same origin.
慕容颖向你微微一笑，刚要开口解释，其余几位弟子笑盈盈地向你主动解释道。¤MuRong Ying smiled at you and is just about to explain when several other disciples take the initiative to explain it to you.
慕容长老您谦虚了，您虽然不善于剑道，但在五行和气道方面的造诣可是厉害非常。¤Elder MuRong, you're too humble. Although you're not good at sword Dao, your achievements in the Five Elements and Qi Dao are impressive.
对了，说起五行之道，我倒是确实有个疑惑之处。就是这个运气之法很少见地需要连续运转五种灵气，而且条件非常苛刻。¤By the way, speaking of the Five Elements, I do have a question. The technique requires the continuous operation of five types of spiritual energy, which is very rare and demanding.
慕容颖眼含笑意，向你点了点头，示意你她们说的没错。¤With a smile in her eyes, MuRong Ying nods to you, signalling to you that the girls are right.
我虽代表星河剑派受邀带队前来，可惜我本人并不擅长剑法，只能从五行的角度加以参悟，不过暂时没什么头绪，还得再继续钻研一二。¤Although I was invited to lead the team on behalf of Celestial River Sect, unfortunately I'm not skilled in sword techniques. I can only approach it from the perspective of the Five Elements and try to comprehend it. I don't have an idea for the moment and still need to study it further.
是啊，长老您不用担心，剑法方面有我们呢，而且功法的抄本已经都奉您的命令递交宗内其他前辈了，应该很快就有回应了。¤That right, there's no need to worry, Elder. We'll take care of the sword techniques, and the copies of the manuals have already been submitted to other senior members of our sect in accordance with your orders. We should receive a response soon
同行的诸弟子有些戒备地看着你，慕容颖向她们示意无需担心，轻启朱唇，向你耐心解释道。¤The fellow disciples around you are somewhat wary, but MuRong Ying indicates to them that there's no need to worry and patiently explains to you with a gentle smile
我们目前的发现就是这些，希望能有所帮助，若没什么事的话我就先继续领悟了，就先不奉陪了。¤These are our current findings, I hope they help. If there's nothing else, I'll continue on with my study of it. Please excuse me.
虽然我金虹剑派是被特邀前来参悟此功法，但我们也深知仅凭我们的能力也许难以达到，得摒除门户之见，集思广益才行。¤Although we, the Radiant Sword Sect, have been specially invited to come and study this technique, we are aware that it may be difficult for us to achieve anything with our abilities alone. We have to set aside our prejudices and brainstorm together.
原来是萧千绝道友，对于此事，不知你有何见解？¤So it's fellow Daoist Xiao QianJue. What are your thoughts on this matter?
萧千绝正在和同行弟子讨论，甚是嘈杂。¤Xiao Qianjue is currently discussing with his fellow disciples, making a lot of noise.
这位道友...可是有所领悟？¤The Daoist here... have you gained any insights?
{$TmpTalkString}也是来参悟五行剑诀的吧，倒没什么好隐瞒的，你也可以听一听我们的猜想。¤{$TmpTalkString} is also here to understand the Five Elements Sword Art, right? There's nothing to hide really. You can hear our theory out.
哈哈哈，{$TmpTalkString}也是来参悟五行剑诀的吧，咱俩之间没什么不可以说的，我就告诉你吧。¤Hahaha, {$TmpTalkString} is also here to understand the Five Elements Sword Art, right? There's nothing we can't talk about between us, so I'll tell you.
先不要打扰他了呢，刚才提到的与金虹剑法有关，那么还可能与什么有关呢？得好好思考一下。¤Let's not disturb him for now. It was mentioned that it's related to the Radiant Sword Art, but what else could it be related to? Got to have a think about it carefully.
嗯，金虹剑法会和五行剑诀起反应，也不算稀奇之事，毕竟是金虹前人所创功法，接着问问别人吧。¤Well, it's not surprising that the Radiant Sword Art would have a reaction with the Five Elements Sword Art, considering it was a technique created by predecessors of the Radiant Sword Sect. Let's ask others about it.
不过啊，真没想到其他三派的剑法，配合起来竟然还有这样的神通...那按经文中所说的，这三派的五行剑法本身就是我金虹所创了...这块历史的空白算是补上了，得禀报掌门才是。¤However, I never thought that the sword arts of the other three sects could be combined to create such Divine skill... According to the scriptures, the sword arts of these three sects were originally created by us Radiant Sword Sect... This fills in a gap in our history, and I need to report it to the Sect Leader.
萧长老说的没错，我们目前就想到了这么多。¤Elder Xiao is right, that's all we've come up with so far.
嘈杂的金虹剑派弟子此时居然安静了许多，萧千绝正对着功法的抄本念念有词。¤The noisy disciples of the Radiant Sword Sect suddenly quiet down, and Xiao QianJue is murmuring to himself while looking at a transcript of the technique.
我金虹剑派道统不知多少万年，宁州本土的剑法大都与我们剑派有关，这个功法也不例外。¤Our Radiant Sword Sect has been in the cultivation realm for tens of thousands of years, and most of the local sword techniques in Ning Province are related to our sect, and this technique is no exception.
金虹剑法会和五行剑诀起反应，也不算稀奇之事，毕竟是金虹前人所创功法，接着问问别人吧。¤It's not surprising that the Radiant Sword Art would have a reaction with the Five Elements Sword Art, considering it was a technique created by predecessors of the Radiant Sword Sect. Let's ask others about it.
我们金虹剑派道统不知多少万年，宁州本土的剑法大多都与我们剑派有关，这个功法也不例外。¤Our Radiant Sword Sect has been in the cultivation realm for tens of thousands of years, and most of the local sword techniques in Ning Province are related to our sect, and this technique is no exception.
希望能够有所帮助，重续古代剑修道统，是我们宁州剑修的夙愿。¤I hope this can help. It is the long time wish of all Ning Province sword cultivators to revive the ancient dao of sword cultivation.
能够集齐五行剑法、重续五行剑诀道统，{$TmpTalkString}可真是厉害非常，在下佩服！佩服！¤To be able to gather all five elements of the sword arts and revive the Dao of Five Elements Sword Art, {$TmpTalkString} is truly impressive, you have my sincere admiration!
我看这功法与我们金虹剑派其他所有神通都无反应，唯独金虹剑法有所不同，定是有所道理，我想以此应该能够解出这个功法的奥秘。¤It seems that this technique does not react to any other Divine skills in our Radiant Sword Sect except for Radiant Sword Art, and there must be a reason for this, which should be the key to unlocking the secrets of this technique.
我们发现这功法与我们金虹剑派其余神通皆无反应，唯独金虹剑法有所不同，想必定是有所道理，这应该是一个突破口。¤We found that this technique does not react to any other Divine skills in our Radiant Sword Sect except for Radiant Sword Art, and there must be something going on. This should be the key to unlocking the secrets of this technique.
若没什么事的话我就先继续领悟了，就先不继续讨论了。¤If there is nothing else I will continue to study it, so I won't be discussing from now on.
竟是{FirstName}道友么？我常听别人提及你的名号，当真是年轻有为！¤Are you Daoist {FirstName}?  I often hear others mention your name, you are really young and talented!
你想做什么？敢动我们碎星商会的货？¤What are you trying to do? Dare to touch the goods of Shattered Star Merchant Guild?
噢？看来你对这片海域还所知甚少。我们碎星商会可是这片无尽之海里最大的商会组织。¤Oh? It seems that you know very little about this sea area. We Shattered Star Merchant Guild is the largest merchant guild in this endless sea.
你们这卖的蓬莎巨蟹螯，怎么价格都翻番了，既然都是从金丹妖兽身上扒下来的材料，凭什么你们卖得这么贵？¤Why have you doubled the price of the Pongsha Crab Claw you sell here? Since they are all materials stripped from Golden Core Spirit Beasts, why are you selling them at such a high price?
那几个蓬莎岛修士发出讥讽的笑声，只见那女性修士的脸瞬间涨的通红。同时，一旁的人群也开始骚动起来，有几个修士站上前理论。¤At this, several Pongsha Island cultivators burst into mocking laughter, and the female cultivator's face instantly turned red. At the same time, the crowd nearby began to stir, and several cultivators stepped forward to argue.
说罢，其中一个蓬莎修士摆出架势，释放出灵力威压，展露出自己金丹期修士的身份。¤With that, one of the Pongsha cultivators made a show of releasing their spiritual power, revealing his identity as a Golden Core cultivator.
一时间，大家的目光都聚集与那女性修士身上，仿佛都在等待她的下一步举动。¤For a moment, everyone's gaze was fixed on the female cultivator, as if waiting for her next move.
人群自动闪出一条通道，目送她离开港口，向着客栈的方向走去了。没等她走多远，人群便一哄而散了。¤The crowd automatically made way, watching her leave the harbor and walk in the direction of the inn. Before she had gone far, the crowd dispersed.
但切莫在港口大打出手，免得扰乱了港口的秩序。还请给我们百里家一个面子，今日就此散了吧。¤But let's not fight here at the harbor, in case we disturb the order here. Please give the Bai Li family some face and let's disperse today.
你随着人流朝港口靠了过去，费了些劲才挤到人群中的前几排，一个女性修士高亮的声音愈发清晰。¤You followed the crowd to the harbor and worked hard to squeeze your way to the front rows of the crowd, where the voice of a female cultivator became increasingly clear.
在下百里奇，诸位前辈和道友若是有何交易上的争议可以私下商议，实在谈不拢可以找我们百里家协调。¤I am Baili Qi. If any seniors or fellow Daoists have any disputes in trade, we can discuss it privately. If we really can't agree, you can come to the Bai Li family to negotiate.
只见这个女性修士身着星河剑派道袍，站在个摊位前，手指着摊位上摆放的各种材料与摊位后的几位修士大声理论道。¤The female cultivator, dressed in the robe of Celestial River Sect, stood in front of a stall, pointing at the various materials on the table and arguing loudly with the several cultivators behind the stall.
这是什么道理，你们那些妖兽在海上也没稀有到哪儿去吧，明明大家猎杀妖兽都花了一样的功夫，难不成你们运个货就能让价格翻一倍？¤What kind of reasoning is this? These Spirit Beasts on the sea are not that rare. Everyone would have put in the same amount of effort hunting these Spirit Beasts, don't tell me that the price doubled because of your shipping?
诸位前辈，诸位道友！¤Seniors, fellow Daoists!
她抿着的嘴唇动了两下，似乎是在把已经到了嘴边的话又咽了下去。沉默片刻后，她转过身大步向人群走来。¤She pursed her lips and seemed to swallow the words that had already come to her lips. After a moment of silence, she turned and strode towards the crowd.
哼！怎么着，你们这是要挑事不成！¤Hmph! What's the matter, are you trying to start something?
还真是差点摊上些麻烦呢...¤It was really close to becoming trouble...
哼，就以这群人的修为能闹到哪儿去。不过他们为之争吵的材料似乎挺稀有，回头可以找他们问问，看看是否有能为你所用的消息。¤Hmph, with their cultivation level, how far can they make trouble? But the materials they argue over seem quite rare. I'll ask them later and see if there is any useful information for you.
哟，真能说啊，那你怎么不自己出海猎杀妖兽，看来是既没那胆子也没那本事，只能在此大放厥词，唬得住谁啊？¤Oh, you can talk, but why don't you go hunting Spirit Beasts on the sea yourself? Seems like you don't have the courage or ability, so you can only boast here. Who are you trying to impress?
正当气氛愈发紧张之时，一道洪亮的声音从身后传出。¤Just as the tension was mounting, a loud voice came from behind.
你们一帮修士仗着人多势众欺负一个女子算什么本事！这位姑娘说的不无道理，哪有你们这么坐地起价的，我们也早就看你们不惯了！¤A group of cultivators bullying a woman, what a noble thing to do! This woman speaks with reason, how can you arbitrarily raise prices? We have long been fed up with you!
也不瞧瞧你们宁州哪儿来的蓬莎巨蟹，这都是我们蓬莎海域的妖兽，物以稀为贵，小姑娘莫非不明白这道理？¤Have you ever considered that there are no Pongsha Crabs in Ning Province? These are all Spirit Beasts from our Pongsha Sea. Miss, don't you understand that rarity makes things precious?
人们纷纷转过头去，只见人群中一个身影闪转腾挪，眨眼功夫便来到了人群聚集的中央。¤People turned their heads and saw a figure moving nimbly through the crowd, appearing in the center in no time.
你们就是垄断！攫取暴利！这个价格让其他散修怎么买得起。¤You are monopolizing the price and making huge profits! This makes it impossible for other independent cultivators to afford.
绝焰堂直属于麟庙的常驻组织，麟庙人数稀少行事低调，即使是我也接触不多，其中甚至有火系大妖存在。¤The Absolute Flame Hall is a resident organization of the Lin Temple. The Lin Temple has a small number of people and keeps a low profile. Even I have little contact with them, and there are even Fire demonic monsters among them.
你转过身悄悄地离开，留李相书一人黯然神伤。¤You turn around and quietly leave, leaving Li Xiangshu alone, feeling gloomy.
这位{FirstName}长老，是近年来唯一破入金丹的本门长老。¤Elder {FirstName} is the only Elder in our sect who has broken through to Golden Core Stage in recent years.
 我们现在有些家务事要处置，阁下还是请回吧。¤We have some family matters to attend to, so please leave for now.
难道那就是{$ShiXiong}所说的{color=#d0380a}灵核{/color}？¤Could that be the {color=#d0380a}Spirit Core{/color} that {$ShiXiong} was talking about?
（原先对百里家还不甚了解，今日倒是获得了不少消息。）¤(I didn't know much about the Baili family, but today I have gained a lot of information.)
好，那你且把草药拿出来让我对对数。\r\n¤Alright, bring out the herbs, and let me check the quantity. \r\n
刚才那位和你争吵的女修士，她要的蓬莎巨蟹螯你这儿还有吗？¤About the female cultivator you were arguing with just now, do you still have the Pongsha Crab Claws she wanted?
对你们来说，这说不定也是一种便宜的方式嘛。\r¤This might as well be a cheap way for you guys. \r
当年就是靠着广陵城这个出海口，掌控了海外货物往宁州的流通，你说这下价格不就任凭他们说了算了。¤Back then, it was through the sea port of Guangling City that the flow of overseas goods to Ning Province was controlled. You can see that prices were literally set by them.
不过猎杀妖兽可没嘴上说说那么容易，因此我们大都寻找信得过的修士结伴出海，算是相互照应吧。¤But hunting Spirit Beasts is not as easy as it sounds. Most of us look for trustworthy cultivators to go to sea with us, so we can look after each other.
如果要找金丹妖兽就得到深海区域了，像刚才那丫头要买的蓬莎巨蟹螯，产自金丹期的蓬莎巨蟹，主要出没于我们蓬莎海域的深海区。¤If you want to find Golden Core Spirit Beasts, you have to go to the deep sea areas. For example, the Pongsha Crab claws that the girl wanted to buy, they are produced by the Pongsha Crab in the Golden Core stage and mainly appear in the deep sea areas of our Pongsha Sea.
{$daoyou}看来是不知道此事呀，他们百里家啊，就是靠着倒卖海外来的这些货物在宁州发家的嘛，而且和海上的商会还颇有渊源呐。¤It seems that {$daoyou} doesn't know about this. The Bai family relies on the sale of these overseas goods to make a fortune in Ning Province, and they also have deep ties with the maritime Merchant Guilds.
哎，摆摊之余随便聊聊罢了。我看{$daoyou}也有几分本事，日后也可出海猎杀些妖兽，到各处去售卖材料嘛。¤Oh, it was just small talk while selling goods. I can see that you also have some skills, you can also go hunting for some Spirit Beasts at sea in the future and sell the materials in various places.
这...还是算了吧。¤It's... let's forget about it.
{$daoyou}不像先前那些人，和你做生意痛快多了。此番也是和{$daoyou}有缘，我这儿有份北宁海图，就送给你吧，待你下次出海便能派上用场。¤Unlike the people before, doing business with you is much more enjoyable. In that case, here's a map of the North Ning Sea, and I will give it to you. It will come in handy for your next voyage.
刚才听你们争吵，还以为你们是隶属于什么商会的呢。¤I thought you were affiliated with some merchant guild when I heard you arguing just now.
虽说你已是正式踏入修仙之道的筑基修士，但在这妖兽四伏的荒野之中赶夜路也不见得是一桩易事。只能暗自期待少遇着些是非。¤Although you are already a Foundation Establishment cultivator who has officially entered the path of immortal cultivation, it is not always an easy task to travel at night in this wilderness where demons and beasts abound. I can only hope that I will encounter less trouble.
好想吃美味的烤肉啊！{vpunch=10,0.5}¤I'm craving some delicious roast meat! {vpunch=10,0.5}
还是算了，我可没这闲工夫。¤Forget it, I don't have the time.
怎么样？是不是比看起来好一点？¤How was it? It's better than it looks, right?
不多时，你看见一头野兽躺倒在地，俨然已无声息，身上却不见有明显的伤口，想必出手的是一位主修神之道的修士。¤Not long afterwards, you see a beast lying on the ground, dead, with no wounds visible on its body; it must have been a cultivator who specializes in soul sense who struck.
这声音，似乎有些熟悉？难不成是天星城的林沐心姑娘？¤This voice seems somewhat familiar? Could it be Miss Lin Muxin from Starsky City?
上次的事，多谢帮忙了，不然我和姐姐最近的日子可没这么自由。喏，刚好姐姐教了我一些有意思的厨艺小技巧，就让你沾沾光吧。¤Thanks for the help last time, otherwise my sister and I wouldn't have had such a free time lately. Here, it just so happens that my sister has taught me some interesting cooking tips, so I'll let you have them.
感谢什么的也不用了。\n¤You don't have to thank me or anything. \n
你走向林沐心，却见她正在试图用凡人的法子生火，不由得问候中多了些调侃。¤You walk towards Lin Muxin, but see that she is trying to make a fire using mortal methods, and cannot help but make a quip in your greeting.
正当你以为林沐心是在为自己失败的厨艺而失落，打算出言安慰她时，没说出口的话却被打断了。¤Just when you think Lin Muxin is getting upset because of her failed cooking and intend to make a comment to comfort her, the unspoken words are interrupted.
当然，你对于火系妖兽是否会喜欢这种“美食”，其实也保持着怀疑态度。¤Of course, you remain sceptical as to whether fire type Spirit Beasts will like this "delicacy".
简单来说，烧烤不过是用火焰来处理生肉而已，林沐心对火焰的掌控力不足又没有相关的经验，这才会出现肉化为焦炭的情况。但你对火道早有颇多领悟，简单的控火烤肉自是不在话下。¤In simple terms, roasting is just using flames to treat raw meat. Lin Muxin's lack of control over flames and lack of experience in this area is why the meat turns into charred meat. But you have a good understanding of the fire dao, so it is easy to control the fire and roast the meat.
直到手头的食材全都被消耗完毕，林沐心又缠着让你传授了一番控火之法后，方才迎着朝霞分别离去。¤It was not until all the ingredients on hand had been used up and Lin Muxin had pestered you to teach her some fire control techniques that she left content under the morning sun.
你居然在用神识辅助烤肉！？¤You're actually using your soul sense to assist in the roasting of the meat!
对于一坨焦炭，你实在无法将之和美味联系在一起，硬要说的话，这不是人类能领会的烹饪艺术，倒是嗜焰蟒一类的火系妖兽说不定能享受一番。¤You can't really associate a pile of char with deliciousness; if anything, it's not a culinary art that humans can appreciate, but a flame-thirsty spirit beast like a Flame Eating Boa might be able to enjoy it.
日暮西沉，天色渐晚。¤The sun is sinking in the west and it is getting late.
直到手头的食材全都被消耗完毕，又聊了一会近来的见闻后，方才迎着朝霞分别离去。¤After using up all the ingredients on hand and chatting for a while about what they had seen recently, they departed in the sunset.
{$name}，好久不见，没想到竟有如此雅兴竟深夜在这荒野之中露营。¤{$name}, It's been a long time since I've seen you, but I didn't expect to see you camping out in the middle of the wilderness late at night.
虽然你对自己的手艺有信心，但似乎没必要为了利用上那些奇形怪状的肉块而徒增几分麻烦。¤Although you have confidence in your cooking skill, but it doesn't seem necessary to add a few bits of trouble in order to make use of the oddly shaped pieces of meat.
一时间着荒郊野岭似乎是安静了下来，只听得生肉上的油脂在火焰的炙烤下，发出“滋滋”的声音。此外便只有木签被你旋转时与烤架发出的轻微摩擦声。¤The wilderness seemed to be calming down for a while. The only sound that could be heard was the grease on the raw meat being roasted in the flames. The only other sound is the slight scraping of the wooden skewers against the grill as you spin them around.
以至于，你忍不住小声问了一句。¤So much so, that you can't help but ask in a whisper.
你摇了摇头，没继续问什么，继续将注意力放到手头的生肉上。¤You shake your head, not asking further questions, and continue to focus on the raw meat at hand.
要不你自己尝尝？¤Why don't you try it for yourself?
很好吃诶，但似乎比姐姐做的差那么一点，嗯，有些地方嚼起来太硬了，这里调料撒多了有点咸。¤It is actually quite good, but it seems to be slightly worse than my sister's. Well, some parts are too hard to chew, and the seasoning here was a bit too salty.
这...这是什么？¤This is... What is this?
显然，眼前的物事和林沐心预期中的烤肉也存在”些许“差别，以致于她并没有第一时间回答你，而是试图说服自己。¤Apparently, there was also a "slight" difference between what was in front of her and what Lin Muxin expected from the roast, so that she did not answer you first, but tried to convince herself.
虽然仅凭经验要做一份烤肉也不是难事，但你一时兴起用神识包裹住生肉，伴随着“滋滋”的炙烤声细致地观察着各个部位的变化。¤It's not difficult to make a roast from experience alone, but on the spur of the moment you wrap your soul sense around the raw meat and watch carefully as the parts change with the sound of sizzling.
怎么会...姐姐上次明明也是这么烤的...调料也是姐姐准备好的...为什么差距会这么大...¤How come... My sister did the same thing last time... She also prepared the spices this time... Why is there such a big difference...
你还在思考着什么，一个大头从野兽背后探了出来，眨巴着眼睛无辜地看向你。仿佛在说这里发生的一切都与她无关，她什么都不知道。¤You are still thinking about something when a large head peeks out from behind the beast, blinking innocently at you. As if to say that everything that happens here has nothing to do with her, that she knows nothing.
只有调料不错么？¤Only the seasoning is good?
这是...这当然是烤肉！你快试试，它只是看起来比较黑其实很美味的！¤It's... It's a roast, of course! Try it, it just looks darker but it's actually delicious!
林沐心显然是忘了自己的杰作，大快朵颐的同时，竟开始挑三拣四。¤Lin Muxin apparently forgot about her masterpiece and, while feasting on it, actually began to pick and choose.
嗯...既然{$name}如此自信，那我就试试吧。¤Hmmm... Since {$name} is so confident, I'll give it a try.
在林沐心殷切的注视下，你试探着咬下一块烤肉，并小心翼翼地咀嚼了几下。¤Under Lin Muxin's eager gaze, you tentatively bite into a piece of roast meat and chew it carefully a few times.
你说完便转身准备离去，林沐心虽觉扫兴但也未作挽留，只是将自己的注意力放在了身前的营火和食材上。¤You left after you finished saying. Lin Muxin felt disappointed but didn't try to make you stay, and turned her attention on the campfire and ingredients in front of her.
总之，林沐心毫不迟疑地接过竹签，咬下一大块烤肉。¤Anyway, Lin Muxin took the skewer without hesitation and bit into a large piece of roast meat.
林沐心本也是精于神之道，你又未曾遮掩自己的举动，自然是不难发现。¤Lin Muxin is also originally skilled in the ways of soul sense, and you have not concealed your movements, so it is naturally not difficult to detect them.
打定主意后，你调转方向，准备去凑个热闹。¤Having made up your mind, you turn around and get ready to go along for the ride.
虽说暮色之下总是危机四伏，但你作为金丹修士，单凭实力已是在宁州有一席之地，别说普通些的妖兽，纵是有修士拦路抢劫或是寻仇，也得掂量掂量自己有几分能耐。¤Although there are always dangers under the moonlight, as a Golden core cultivator, you already have a place in the Ning Province based on your strength alone, not to mention ordinary Spirit Beasts, even if there are cultivators stopping the road for robbery or seeking revenge, they have to weigh up their capabilities.
你看着眼前这一串串的黑色碳状物，完全无法将之和食物联系在一起。¤You look at the strands of black carbon in front of you and can't relate it to food at all.
你不知林沐心打算如何评价自己的“杰作”，但至少，你可以从她的表情看出，她姑且还是人类，不是什么火系妖兽。¤You don't know what Lin Muxin intends to say about her "masterpiece", but at least you can tell by the look on her face that she is still human and not some fire Spirit Beast.
我还以为是谁呢，原来是你。¤I was thinking who was it, so it was you.
话音未落，两个精致的小包已经递到了你手上，随之而来的便是林沐心满是希冀的目光，似乎要占满你的眼帘。¤Before the words are out of your mouth, two small, delicate bags are handed to you. And with them comes Lin Muxin's hopeful eyes, seemingly trying to fill your entire view.
一时间，你竟有些期待烤肉完成的那一刻。¤For a moment, you actually look forward to the moment when the roast is finished.
一段时间后。¤After a while.
面对她不甘心的追问，你陷入了沉默。¤You lapse into silence in the face of her reluctant questioning.
不过小道耳，要是感兴趣我待会教你。¤It's just some little tricks, if you are interested, I will teach you later.
至少这个烤肉用的调料还是不错的，虽然你撒多了一点...¤At least the seasoning for this roast is good, although you sprinkle a little too much...
虽说你已是正式踏入修仙之道的炼气修士，但在这妖兽四伏的荒野之中赶夜路也不见得是一桩易事。只能暗自期待少遇着些是非。¤Although you are already a Qi refining cultivator who has officially entered the path of immortality, it is not always easy to travel at night in this wilderness where demons and beasts are everywhere. You can only hope that you will encounter less trouble.
林沐心似乎沉迷享受烤肉，不但没有听清你问的是什么，还因为完全不顾形象地边吃边回答，让你也没太听懂她的回答。¤Lin Muxin seems to be engrossed in enjoying the grilled meat. Not only did she not hear what you were asking, and by answering while eating with total disregard for her image, you don't quite understand her answer either.
“嘿！”¤"Hey!"
但还未等你为自己辩解什么，方才做好的几串烤肉都已经消弭无踪，她显然对你的手艺还是挺满意的。¤But before you can say anything in your defence, the few skewers of roast meat you've just made have disappeared into thin air, and she's clearly quite pleased with your cooking skill.
一道脆生生的娇喝从不远处传来，应该是有个女修正在附近与人争斗。但动静却不是很大，兴许只是个筑基修士。¤A delicate cry came from not far away, it should be a female cultivator fighting with someone nearby. But the commotion was not very loud, so perhaps it was just a Foundation Establishment cultivator.
你默默地运起遁术，趁林沐心还未反应过来，早已溜之大吉。¤You silently activate your mobility technique and slipped away long before Lin MuXin could react.
{$name}你平时吃东西都这样么...¤{$name} Do you usually eat like this...
于是，犹豫再三之后...¤So, after much hesitation...
可能是对自己手艺充满了信心，也可能是你的表现给了她信心，亦或是她从未见过被考成焦炭的食物而有些好奇。¤It could be that she is confident in her cooking skill, or that your performance has given her confidence, or that she has never seen food that has been burnt and is a little curious.
林沐心高兴的邀请你在营火旁坐下后，便自顾自地忙碌了起来。¤After happily inviting you to sit down by the campfire, Lin Muxin went about her business on her own.
为了不打击林沐心的信心，你点了点头，而后试图在这坨“焦炭”上找到一个足以说服自己和林沐心的亮点。¤You nod so as not to undermine Lin Muxin's confidence, and then try to find a good thing to say about the pile of "charcoal" that would convince you and Lin Muxin.
一道脆生生的娇喝从不远处传来，应该是有个女性修士正在附近与人争斗。但动静却不是很大，兴许是与你实力相当。¤A delicate cry comes from not far away, it should be a female cultivator who is fighting with someone nearby. But the commotion is not very loud, so perhaps it is of equal strength to you.
调料还有么，要不让我来试试吧。¤Do you have any more spices, how about letting me try?
吼次，很吼次，和给给烤的一样吼次。¤Delisos, vewy delishos, i's as delisious as w'at wy sish cook'd
你将剩余的生肉如法炮制了一番，两人在享受烤肉的同时闲聊着近来的见闻，直到东方泛白才各自离去。¤You cooked the rest of the raw meat, and the two of you enjoyed the roast while chatting about what you had seen recently until there was sun light coming from the east before you each left.
鲜嫩多汁，肥而不腻什么的也不用多说，仅是看林沐心大快朵颐的样子便已经能感受到这烤肉的魅力。¤Nothing needs to be said about the juicy, fatty greasy meat, just by seeing Lin Muxin gobble it up, you can already know how delicious this roast meat is.
褪毛，去骨，切成大块，用削好的细枝串好，再支起一个简易的架子在营火上炙烤。¤Remove the fur, remove the bones, cut into large chunks, skewer them with sharpened thin branches and set up a simple rack to roast them over the campfire.
火还未灭，烤架也有现成的， 也就是需要重新切肉然后穿成串而已。至于林沐心切好的那些，你可没打算直接用。¤The fire is still going and there's a ready-made grill, so you just need to re-cut the meat and put it on skewers. As for the ones Lin Muxin has cut up, you don't intend to use them straight away.
她的动作虽是有些笨拙，切出来的肉块大小不一，形状也各有特色，可谓每一块肉都像是有自己的故事，但总的来说还是有模有样。¤Her movements were a little clumsy, and the pieces of meat she cut were of different sizes and shapes, and each piece of meat seemed to have its own story, so to speak, but in general they were decent.
可惜我还有任务在身，看来是与{$name}烹饪的美味无缘了，告辞。¤Unfortunately, I've got work to do, so it looks like I'm out of luck with {$name}'s culinary delights, so goodbye.
再加上被高温激发的食材和香料的香气，可谓色香俱全，只差好好品尝一番滋味如何了。¤Coupled with the aroma of ingredients and spices that have been stimulated by high temperature, it is a perfect combination of color, aroma and taste, only awaiting for someone to give it a try.
你听倪旭欣这么一说，心中的怀疑顿时消散不少，仔细想想，他除了爱惹事，关键时候掉链子，炼的丹药总是一言难尽等，其他时候还是挺靠谱的，大概？¤Hearing Ni XuXin's words, the doubt in your heart dissipated. When you think about it, aside from his tendency to cause trouble, falter at critical moments, and make questionable pills, he was generally reliable. Probably?
既然如此，那就有劳{$name}了。¤In that case, I'll have to trouble {$name}.
但事已至此，烤肉的味道也确实不错，你只能无奈地继续享用这奇怪的“灵草烤肉”了。¤But since things have come to this point and the taste of the roast is indeed good, you have no choice but to continue to enjoy the strange "spirit herb roast meat".
这个我也问过杨管家啦，按他的说法就是修炼这事急不来。¤I've asked Steward Yang about this, too. According to him, cultivation is not something that can be rushed.
这样一来享受美味的同时，还可以提升修为。¤This way you can enjoy a delicious meal and improve your cultivation at the same time.
你看着倪旭欣手中的泽莽，但脑中挥之不去的却是林沐心专心烤制焦炭的样子。¤You look at the swamp python in Ni XuXin's hand, but what lingers in your mind is the image of Lin Muxin intently roasting charcoal.
蛇肉原本因为脂肪极少，在烤制过程中很容易肉质变老，也不知他用了什么技巧，外表呈现出一层金黄色的烤焦表层的同时又可以看出内部依旧处于鲜嫩多汁的状态。¤The snake meat, which has very little fat, would have easily become overcooked during the roasting process, but somehow he managed to get a golden brown charred layer on the outside while still being tender and juicy on the inside.
其实也不常吃啦，只是突然来了兴致而已。上次正经吃烤肉还是小时候杨管家带我野营来着，一晃也是许多年前的事了。¤I don't really eat it that often, it's just a sudden craving. The last time I had a proper barbecue was when I was a kid and steward Yang took me camping, that was many years ago.
{$name}刚才说杨管家做的烤肉特别美味，难道他精于烹饪一道？¤{$name}, you just said that the roast meat made by Steward Yang is particularly delicious, is he a good cook?
自然是不会拒绝，但...我有些担心修仙者的厨艺水平...¤Naturally, I would not refuse, but... I was a bit worried about the level of cooking skills the immortal cultivators have...
不过我小时候可是跟杨管家学了一手的，他做的烤肉那滋味，啧，这么多年我都没忘，不信你就等着瞧好了。¤But I learnt from Steward yang when I was a kid, and the taste of his roast meat, tsk, I haven't forgotten it after all these years, just wait and see.
{$name}所说果然不假，这等手艺竟只是同杨管家学过几手，看来{$name}在烹饪方面颇有天赋啊。¤{$name} is so right about this. To have only learnt a few skills from the steward Yang and cook so well,  it seems that {$name} is pretty talented in cooking.
{FirstName}{xiongdi}，你说我这么热爱炼丹，是不是有朝一日也会成为炼丹大师？¤{xiongdi} {FirstName}, do you think if I love alchemy so much, I will become an alchemy master one day?
我真不愧是未来的炼丹宗师啊，哈哈哈哈。¤I am truly worthy of being a future master of alchemy, hahahahaha.
烤制时间虽是不长，但其中滋味已是非同凡响，让你不禁赞叹连连。¤The roasting time is not long, but the taste is already extraordinary and you can't help but admire it.
（ 反正焦炭我也尝过了，这次总不能更惨吧。）¤(I've had a taste of burnt food anyway, so it can't be worse this time.)
没想到{$name}居然也对烧烤这么有兴趣....¤I didn't realize {$name} was so interested in roasting too ....
那不应该多花些时间修炼么？¤Shouldn't you spend more time cultivating then?
闻言，倪旭欣一脸喜色地点了点头，有机会和你分享美食似乎让他很是开心。¤At his words, Ni XuXin nodded with a happy face, the opportunity to share the food with you seemed to make him very happy.
至少我很难见到父亲和振南叔他们有闲下来的时候，但不论有什么事找杨管家，他总在倪府大厅或是厨房里。¤At least I rarely saw my father and Uncle Zhennan and the others idle, but no matter what I asked of Steward Yang, he was always in the hall or kitchen of the Ni Manor.
是啊，他对美食很感兴趣的。你别看他是倪府管家，其实挺清闲的，大事有父亲，振南叔他们负责，小事又只用吩咐一声，所以没事的时候特别爱捣鼓这些。¤Yes, he is very interested in food. Don't be fooled by his position as the Ni Manor steward, he actually has a lot of time to spare, as he has his father and Uncle Zhennan to take care of the important matters, and he only has to give orders for the small matters, so he likes to tinker with these things when he has free time.
你嘴角一抽，想起他给你的那些废丹。但也不想打击倪旭欣，只能口是心非的回答一句。¤The corner of your mouth twitches, thinking of the useless pills he gave you. But you don't want to discourage Ni XuXin either, so you could only say something that you don't really mean.
一般来说是这样啦，悟道学习功法神通什么的就已经足够消耗时间了，哪有这个兴致再去研究无关紧要的烹饪呢。¤Generally speaking, it's enough time consuming to learn techniques and divine skills, so you don't have the inclination to study inconsequential cooking .
哎？只要一小会就...¤What? It only takes a little while to...
嘿嘿，不错吧，而且我还稍微调整了一下杨管家教我的调料配比，在里面加入了很多有生息、聚元功效的灵草磨成的粉末。¤Hey, it's not bad, right? And I've also slightly adjusted the seasoning ratio that Steward Yang taught me. I've added a lot of powdered spirit herbs that helps with vitality and Qi-absorbing.
倪旭欣满意地打量自己的杰作一番后，径直将烤肉递到了你手上。¤After surveying his masterpiece with satisfaction, Ni XuXin handed the roast straight to you.
话语间，倪旭欣的第一串烤肉已经完成了。¤As the words were spoken, Ni XuXin's first skewer of grilled meat was finished.
也许是吧？¤Maybe?
真巧啊，这不是{FirstName}{xiongdi}么？我正好杀了一头上好的泽蟒打算做烧烤。¤What a coincidence, isn't this {xiongdi} {FirstName}? I happened to kill a good Pond Boa intended for a barbecue.
可能是泽蟒块头相对比较小的关系，倪旭欣处理的速度倒是不慢，切出的肉块也较林沐心更为规则平整，让你对他的手艺有了更多信心。¤Probably because of the relatively small size of the Pond Boa, Ni XuXin was not slow in handling it, and the pieces of meat cut out were more regular and flat than Lin Muxin's, giving you more confidence in his cooking skill.
未等倪旭欣开口，你御起遁术就跑，最后追上来的也不过是半句没说完的话而已。¤Before Ni XuXin can say anything, you charge up your mobility technique and run, and the last thing that reaches you is only an unfinished sentence.
修仙者对饮食是没什么要求，但谁又会拒绝偶尔来一顿美味呢哈哈哈哈。¤Cultivators have little requirement for food and drink, but who would refuse a delicious meal once in a while hahahaha.
而且要是喜欢烹饪用不了多少时间就能学好的，更不用说还对调整心境有好处。¤And if you like cooking you can learn to do it in no time at all, not to mention that it's good for your state of mind.
也不至于这么清闲吧...¤It can't be that free...can it?
你撕下一块烤肉放入嘴中，慢慢地咀嚼着。¤You tear off a piece of roast meat and put it in your mouth, chewing it slowly.
你嘴角一抽，想起熟识的另一位“炼丹爱好者”。但也不想打击倪旭欣，只能口是心非的回答一句。¤The corner of your mouth twitches as you remember another "alchemy enthusiast" you know well. But you don't want to discourage Ni XuXin either, so you could only say something that you don't really mean.
一时间，你竟不知道自己是该吐槽些什么，还是该干脆动手揍他一顿。¤For a moment, you don't know whether you should roast him or simply punch him in the face.
先是混杂着一股草药味的麻辣味刺激着你的味蕾，紧接着恰到好处的焦香在唇齿间四溢，还未等你仔细品味，又有肉汁充盈了你的味觉。¤The spicy, herbal flavour tingles your taste buds, followed by just the right amount of char on your lips and teeth, and before you can taste it, the juices fill your mouth.
你循声望去，引入眼帘的却是漫天的红色剑气，其中还夹杂着从血亢剑仙眼中涌出的狠厉之色。¤As you turn towards the sound, you are greeted by a sky of red Sword Qi, interspersed with the ruthlessness that pours from the eyes of the Blood-Crazed Sword Immortal.
得到你的允肯后，百里奇急不可耐地欺身进攻。¤After receiving your consent, Baili Qi eagerly strikes.
前辈放水可就没意思了。¤It wouldn't be interesting if you went easy on me.
深林之中，一声震天的怒吼从远处传来，随后是一声修士的咆哮，声音如同狂风般席卷而来，稳稳的盖住了怒吼声。¤In the midst of the deep forest, an earth-shattering roar came from the distance, followed by a cultivator's shout. The shout is like a hurricane sweeping over, firmly covering up the sound of the roar.
百里奇已是满足于刚才的切磋，你也不想再提烤肉的事，便各自分头离去了。¤Baili qi was already content with the sparring session just now, and you didn't want to mention the roast any more, so you each went your separate ways.
那...¤So...
都什么奇奇怪怪的，既然今天恰好遇到{FirstName}道友，不如来切磋一番吧。¤What's all this weirdness? Since we happened to meet Daoist {FirstName} today, why don't we come and have a sparring session?
{FirstName}道友还是少惦记那什么烤肉，多多修炼为好。¤Daoist {FirstName} should think less about that roast meat and cultivate more.
烤肉？什么烤肉？¤Roast meat? What roast meat?
不等你拒绝，百里奇已是欺身抢攻而来。¤Without waiting for you to refuse, Baili qi already starts his attack.
{FirstName}道友真是不简单啊。¤Daoist {FirstName} is really something.
难道你不是因为馋烤肉才来猎杀推山兽的？¤Did you not come to hunt the Mountain Pushing Beast because you had a craving for roast meat?
那你是一时兴起要回味曾今的美味来猎杀推山兽的？¤So you're hunting the Mountain Pushing Beast on the spur of the moment to relive the culinary delight of the past?
眼见有人靠近，他似乎是对推山兽失去了兴趣，不再与之硬碰硬战斗，而是一个错身躲开攻击，然后连续三道踢击命中推山兽要害之上。¤Seeing someone approaching, he seemed to have lost interest in the Mountain Pushing Beast and stopped fighting it head-on, but instead dodging the attacks and hitting the beast's vitals with three consecutive kicks.
百里奇一脸失望，但也不敢多说什么，只得看着你离去。¤Baili qi looked disappointed, but didn't dare say anything more, so he just watched you leave.
那巨兽只来得及发出一声悲鸣，而后便倒在坑中，溅起一圈黄土。¤The giant beast only had time to let out a mournful cry before it collapsed into the pit, splashing a circle of yellow dirt.
多谢前辈指点，过瘾，过瘾！¤Thank you for your guidance, Senior, it was very satisfying!
都什么奇奇怪怪的，既然今天恰好遇到{FirstName}前辈，还请前辈指点一番。¤What's with all these strange things? Since I happened to meet Senior {FirstName} today, I would like to ask for you to give me some guidance.
巨坑正中间则是一头约莫筑基后期的推山兽，与一位身形高大的修士。此人正用不亚于推山兽的强壮臂膀与后者贴身战斗。¤In the middle of the huge pit is a Mountain Pushing Beast at about late Foundation Establishment stage, fighting in close combat with a tall cultivator whose strength was no less than that of the beast.
不是。¤No.
不多时，一个巨坑赫然出现在你眼前，几棵不知生长了多久的树木残骸凌乱地倒在巨坑外围，其他的也不知是在战斗中被掀飞了出去，还是在余波中被绞成了齑粉。¤Soon, a giant pit appeared before your eyes, with the remains of several trees that had been growing for god knows how long scattered around the edge of the pit. Other trees were either thrown out during the battle or ground to dust in the aftermath.
百里奇虽还未满足于刚才的切磋，但你也不想和他再打过，便各自分头离去了。¤Although Baili qi was not yet satisfied with the sparring session just now, you did not want to fight him again, so you each went your separate ways.
你们四大家族的少主难道都对烤肉情有独钟么？¤Do all the young masters of the four major families have a penchant for roast meat?
原来是{FirstName}道友，当年英杰会上道友的英姿让我回味至今啊哈哈。¤Ah, it's Daoist {FirstName}. Your heroic appearance at the Elites' Gathering years ago has stayed with me until now, hahaha.
不错不错，与{FirstName}道友一战真是过瘾！¤Not bad, not bad, it was really satisfying to battle with Daoist {FirstName}!
{FirstName}道友实力对于炼气修士已经很不错了，但还是少惦记那什么烤肉，多多修炼为好。¤Daoist {FirstName} strength is already very good for a Qi refining cultivator, but it's better to think less about that grilled meat and cultivate more.
但未等你提出第三个问题，百里奇已经急不可耐地打断了你。¤But before you can ask a third question, Baili Qi already interrupts you impatiently.
原来是{FirstName}道友。¤Ah, it's Daoist {FirstName} .
眼前的是一副巨大的蛇骨，一根根机关锁链从一节节从玉石状的脊骨中穿过。虽已身死，连血肉都在时间流逝中消散，但一股威压仍从骸骨上散开。¤Before your eyes is a huge snake skeleton, with chains of mechanical locks passing through each section of its spine, shaped like jade stones. Although it is already dead, and even the flesh and blood have dissipated in the passage of time, yet a sense of oppression still emanates from the bones.
嗯，通常鳞甲一族会激发自己的龙族血脉化龙，修己身证道的少之又少，只是可惜了...哎。\n¤Well, usually those from the Scale Clan would stimulate their dragon bloodline to transform into dragons, and there are very few who cultivate their own bodies to attain the Dao, it's just a pity... sigh.
这尸体生前至少也是化神强者吧。¤This corpse must have been at least a Deity Transformation stage when it was alive.
不过，这可是化神妖圣骸骨，六品炼器材料别浪费了。¤However, this is the skeleton of a Deity Transforming Saint Beast, don't waste this sixth-grade Forging material.
空中是一条空间裂隙，肆虐的空间风暴湮灭了周围的一切。¤In the air is a spatial rift, and a raging spatial storm annihilating everything around it.
还是小心避开吧。¤It's better to be careful and avoid it.
虽说石碑上写着矿脉二字，但是眼前的不过是一个深坑罢了，但细细看去也有零散的矿物散落其中。¤Although the stone tablet reads 'Ore Vein', what is in front of us is just a deep pit, but upon closer inspection, there are scattered minerals within it.
此地之前已经被人采伐一空了，不过灵气充裕又有新的矿物生成。¤This place has already been completely harvested by someone before, but there is still abundant spiritual energy and new minerals are being generated.
此地似乎还有别的玄妙，我现在要离开这里么？{w}{w=0.5}¤It seems that there are other mysteries in this place. Should I leave now? {w}{w=0.5}
此地似乎还有别的玄妙，我还是再转转吧。¤It seems that there are other mysteries in this place, I'll take another look around.
眼前是一张木桌，上面放了一本秘籍。\n¤In front of you is a wooden table with a secret book on it. \n
“世人总觉阵修布阵多多益善，我偏要反其道行之。”¤"People always think that for an Array Cultivator, it is always better to have more arrays, but I prefer to go against the norm."
拿了典籍，发现桌面上还刻了几行小字。¤Having taken the secret book, I found a few small lines inscribed on the table.
这位前辈，倒也有趣。¤This senior is quite interesting.
应对天劫自然全力以赴，肯定不会有好东西留下。¤It is natural to go all out when facing the heavenly tribulation, and there will certainly be no good things left behind.
这炼器室空无一物。¤This Forging room is completely empty.
字条上书“耐药了，便宜你了。”¤The note reads "Good news for you. I'm already resistant to these pills."
眼前是几个药瓶，和一张字条。¤In front of you are several vials of pills, and a note.
...那就多谢前辈啦。¤... Thank you very much, Senior.
你冲着主殿的方向喊道。¤You shout in the direction of the main hall.
阴。¤Yin.
仔细观察石碑，上面书写了一个你从未见过的字符，但是你却下意识的念出了声。¤Examining the stone tablet intently, you come across characters that are unfamiliar to you, yet you find yourself pronouncing it automatically. 
这就是我们在幻阳境看到的修补空间的灵纹吧。¤This is the same spirit pattern that we saw in the Illusory Yang Realm to mend space.
一道道灵纹从石碑上散发而出融入这片空间。¤One by one, spiritual patterns emerge from the tablet and merge into the surrounding space.
那您也读出来了？¤So you could read it too?
是的，看来此地颇有玄妙啊，一会见机行事。¤Yes, it seems that this place is quite mysterious. Let's act accordingly when the opportunity arises.
从未耳闻。¤Never heard of it.
魏老，您见过这种文字么？¤Old Wei, have you ever seen this kind of writing?
不过目前我们没有见到尸首血迹，这里不像是发生了争斗，倒像是被主动弃置了。¤However, we have not seen any corpses or bloodstains at the moment. It doesn't seem like a fight happened here, but rather like it was abandoned voluntarily.
这一路上都是废墟，看起来此地也是经历了一场浩劫。¤It has been nothing but all ruins along the way. This place appears to have being through a catastrophe as well.
突然眼前的雕像漂浮空中，一阵不弱于化神修士的威压四散开来，你能感受到以他的神识已经牢牢锁定了你。¤Suddenly, the statue in front of you floats in mid-air, and a pressure no weaker than that of a Deity Transformation cultivator spread out. You could feel that his Soul Sense has firmly locked onto you.
又是这所谓的灵文。¤It is this so-called spiritual pattern again.
低头看地上的匾额有两个字符¤Looking down at the plaque on the floor there are two characters
破界..¤Boundary Breaking...
眼前的废墟之上漂浮着一座巨大的六臂雕像宛如一个黑洞鲸吞此界灵气。¤A huge six-armed statue floats above the ruins in front of you, swallowing the Qi of this place like a black hole .
地面上繁复的灵纹构成了一个太极图，正上方远远不断的阳气被抽入次方空间又输送向远方。¤The complex spiritual patterns on the ground form a Tai Ji diagram, and far above, the continuous yang energy is drawn into the subspace and transported to distant places.
从左右而来的阴阳两气在此地汇聚，相互作用之下融合为一到先天灵力输入前方的六臂人像。¤The Yin and Yang energies from the left and right converge here, blending together into primordial spiritual energy that is inputted into the six-armed figure ahead.
眼前的建筑，已经在狂暴的灵气和空间乱流中坍塌。在废墟中可以看到幻阳境三个字。¤The building in front of you has collapsed amidst the raging spiritual energy and chaotic spatial turbulence. The words 'Illusory Yang Realm' appears in the ruins.
你看到一玄武雕塑，浮于石台之上，强大的灵力从其上散发而出。¤You see a sculpture of Black Tortoise, floating on a stone platform, with powerful spiritual energy emanating from it.
好大的一块焚天火玉，这一块若是用来炼器至少有十份的数量。¤What a huge piece of Burning Heavens Jade. If it were used for forging, it would be enough for at least ten artefacts.
石台上铭刻的阵法从这边空间中源源不断的汲取极阳之力，再通过其上的晶石传导入整个机关城。¤The Array inscribed on the stone platform continuously draws extreme Yang energy from this space, and then transmits it into the entire mechanical city through the crystals on top of it.
你看到一龙形雕塑，浮于石台之上，强大的灵力从其上散发而出。¤You see a dragon sculpture floating on a stone platform, with powerful spiritual energy emanating from it.
你看到一座龙形雕塑，浮于石台之上，强大的灵力从其上散发而出。¤You see a dragon sculpture, floating on a stone platform, with powerful spiritual energy emanating from it.
你看到一朱雀雕塑，浮于石台之上，强大的灵力从其上散发而出。¤You see a sculpture of Vermilion Bird, floating on a stone platform, with powerful spiritual energy emanating from it.
此处的阵法从另一界抽取至阴之气来维持此界，也不知什么东西需要如此恐怖的阴气源源不断的供给。¤The array here draws extreme Yin energy from another realm to maintain this world. God knows what requires such a terrifying amount of endless Yin energy.
地面上繁复的灵纹构成了一个太极图，正上方远远不断的阴气被抽入次方空间又输送向远方。¤The complex spiritual patterns on the ground form a Tai Ji diagram, and far above, the continuous Yin Qi is drawn into the subspace and transported to a distance.
在这极阳之地这名字倒是贴切，不过此地的极阳之力汇聚到此地之后消失不见了。¤The name of this place, Extreme Yang Land, is quite fitting. However, the Extreme Yang energy here disappears after it converges here.
我想起传说中千机子的洞府其实分为阴阳两面，你尝试向那信物注入灵力？¤I remember that according to legend, the abode of Venerable Myriad Secrets is actually divided into two sides, yin and yang. Have you tried infusing spiritual power into that token?
天...阳...阁...¤Heavenly... Yang... Pavilion...
以你的阵道修为，你很快理清了此地的布置。你手掐法诀一道传送门出现在你眼前。¤With your knowledge of arrays, you quickly figured out the layout of this place. You formed a hand seal and a teleportation portal appeared before your eyes.
你是说眼前的这些，不过是一些外围建筑罢了?¤Are you saying that these in front of us are just some peripheral buildings?
走，看看这位前辈还有什么手段。¤Let's go and see what else this Senior has up his sleeve.
你手持信物，随着灵力的注入一道传送门出现在你眼前。¤You hold a token in your hand, and with the infusion of spiritual power, a teleportation portal appears before you.
以你的阵道修为，你难以分辨此地阵法之中的玄妙。¤With your skill in Dao of Array, it is difficult for you to discern the subtleties within this array.
进入眼前的建筑,建筑内部十分单调，和外面的四象阵基如出一辙，不同的是眼前的石台上悬浮的是一块玉牌。¤Entering the building in front of you, the interior is very monotonous, similar to the Four Symbols Array outside. The difference is that there is a suspended jade plaque on the stone platform in front of you.
我想起传说中千机子的洞府确实分为阴阳两面，居然被你提前开启了。¤I remember that according to legend, the abode of Venerable Myriad Secrets was indeed divided into two sides, yin and yang. It's unbelievable that you are able to opened it.
{xiaozi}快走，这里留不得。¤{xiaozi}, hurry up and leave. You can't stay here.
话音未落，远处最后一块完整的石碑轰然碎裂。同时这片空间开始崩溃。¤As soon as the words fell, the last intact stone tablet in the distance shattered with a loud noise. At the same time, this space began to collapse.
看来此地也没什么收获了。¤It seems that there is nothing more to be gained from this place.
虽不知这门后是什么，但也只有冒险一试了。¤I don't know what's behind this door, but I can only take the risk and give it a try.
阳？¤Yang?
不好，这片空间已经维持不住了，我们快走。¤Not good, this space can no longer be sustained. Let's leave quickly.
阴阳两字成旋涡状融合，阴阳之力撕开一道空间门。¤The two characters of Yin and Yang merge into a vortex, and the power of Yin and Yang tears open a spatial door.
你御起遁光直奔出口，但随着空间波动入口也消失不见了。¤You used your mobility technique and headed straight for the exit, but as the spatial fluctuations occurred, the entrance disappeared without a trace.
突然，从石碑碎片中散溢出一道至阴之气，在空中汇聚成你熟悉的“阴”字，同时空中也出现了另一个字符。¤Suddenly, a burst of extremely yin energy emanates from the fragments of the stone tablet and converges in mid-air, forming a familiar Chinese character for "yin". At the same time, another character appeared in the air.
八成是此原因。¤It's probably because of this reason.
我们再去别的地方看看吧。¤Let's go take a look somewhere else.
能有影响到一方异空间的话...我们也必有耳闻。¤We must also have heard of it if it could affect some other world.
这一处阵基居然自爆损毁了，看来也是因此这地方才现世了。¤The array base for this place has unexpectedly exploded and was completely destroyed, which seems to be the reason for its reappearance in the outside world.
你看到破碎的石台阵基和四周散落的晶石碎片。¤You see the broken stone platform for the array and scattered crystal fragments around it.
按理说此地阵法，汲取空间中的极阳之力，不应出现这种变故。¤Normally, such anomaly should not have occured to the array here since it draws on the extreme yang energy in the space.
宁州古迹？¤The Ning Province Ancient Ruin?
这块焚天火玉应该是突然承受了一股巨大的灵力之后爆炸了，看来是最近有什么原因导致此处空间的灵气出现巨变。¤This Burning Heavens Jade appears to have exploded due to a sudden surge of spiritual power. It appears that something recent has caused a significant shift in the spiritual energy of this area.
细细观察一番，但以你的阵道修为也看不出什么端倪。\n¤You take a closer look. Nevertheless, with your current skill in Dao of array, you are unable to come up with anything useful. \n
眼前是一道灵力屏障，你出手试探一击屏障纹丝不动。¤In front of you is a spiritual barrier, and when you try to strike it, it does not budge.
嗯。先看看维持此地运转的阵基吧。¤Okay. Let's first take a look at the array that maintains the operation of this place.
眼前是一道灵力屏障，在你靠近之时就散开了。¤In front of you is a spiritual barrier that disperses as you approach. 
这屏障与整个空间相连接，很难蛮力破开。¤This barrier is connected to the entire space, and it's difficult to break it with brute force.
看来解除了四象阵基，这屏障也就难以为继了。¤It seems that with the removal of the Four Symbols Array, the barrier will be no longer be sustainable.
和之前的天阳阁一样，这里也不是这机关城的核心。¤Like the Heavenly Yang Pavilion before it, this is also not the heart of this mechanical city.
天阴阁，这位前辈的起名字可真偷懒。¤Heavenly Yin Pavilion... seems like a lazy choice by the Senior who named it.
阴阳两气汇聚在一起没入地面。“咔咔咔”一阵机关响动之后，地面露出一道门。¤The two energies of Yin and Yang converged together and entered the ground. After a series of mechanical clicking sounds, a door appeared on the ground.
眼前只有一个石台，上面的凹槽正好可以放入你在幻阳境得到的信物。¤There is only a stone platform in front of you, and the socket on it is just right to hold the token you obtained in the Illusory Yang Realm.
此处秘境居然是天地异象极阳之地¤This secret realm is actually place of extraordinary phenomena - the extreme Yang realm !
刚一进入，一阵阵狂暴的热浪扑面而来。¤Upon entering, you are immediately met with waves of intense heat.
来都来了，就见识一下这位前辈万年前的技艺吧。¤Since you're already here, let's see what this Senior from thousands of years ago has got.
不过此地已经被人占据，布置了机关阵法，看来是一处已经有主的洞府。¤Nevertheless, someone has already installed mechanical arrays at this place. It seems to be an Abode that is already owned by someone.
那这位前辈的手法也可称得上是鬼斧神工，竟能将一处天地异象化为己用。虽然已过了万载竟然这个洞府依旧在运转。¤The expertise of this Senior is so remarkable that it could be described as magical, given his ability to harness extraordinary phenomena for his own purposes. Despite the passage of tens of thousands of years, this abode remains functional.
你散开神识，感知到此地已经有人布置了机关阵法。¤You spread your soul sense and sense that someone has already set up a mechanical array here.
对，看此地灵力流转此方天地依旧运转，只是不知出了什么变故才导致这洞府现世了。¤Yes, based on the flow of spiritual energy in this area, everything seems to be functioning normally. However, for reasons unknown, the abode was suddenly unveiled to the outside world.
看此地机关布置手法和其上所使用的灵纹，这洞府的主人应是数万年前因精通丹阵器而闻名九州的化神修士千机子。¤Based on the way the mechanical devices and spiritual patterns are arranged in this place, the owner of this abode should be Venerable Myriad Secrets, a renowned Deity Transformation cultivator who was famous throughout the Nine Provinces tens of thousands of years ago for his mastery in Alchemy, Array and Forging.
没错，道友能来到此地也是你我缘分一场。¤That's right, it's fate that fellow Daoist and I have met here.
（有自主思维的傀儡么？）¤(A puppet with a conscious mind?)
而我不过是千机子的一缕神念，在此等待后人来到太极殿。¤And I am but a wisp of Venerable Myriad Secrets's soul, waiting here for someone to come to the Hall of Tai Ji.
嗯，不论是自动修复空间的灵纹还是两个相连的天地异象都不像是前辈的手笔。¤Well, whether it's the spiritual pattern that automatically repair space or the two connected extraordinary phenomenon, neither seem to be the work of the Senior.
小友读出了那从未见过的字吧。¤My little friend, you have deciphered the unseen characters, right?
天劫将至，自然是渡劫去了。¤The heavenly tribulation is approaching, so naturally he is preparing for the tribulation.
前辈是千机子？¤Are you Venerable Myriad Secrets?
眼前的傀儡突然发声。¤The puppet in front of you suddenly made a sound.
前辈也是一缕残魂？¤Is the senior also just a wisp of remnant soul?
在我们精善傀儡的修士中，一直有人认为我们不必遵循那套渡劫飞升的理论，直接将元神寄宿在傀儡中便可以长生。¤Among our skilled puppet cultivators, there have always been those who believe that we do not need to follow the theory of ascending through tribulations, but can directly house our primordial spirit in puppets for immortality.
看来这里就是那位千机子的核心洞府了。¤It seems that this is the main abode of Venerable Myriad Secrets.
没错，此地确实不是天然形成，很多迹象表明这里是人为开辟出来的异空间。¤Yes, it is true that this place is not natural and there are many signs that it is a man-made exotic space. suggest it was artificially made.
准确的说我是千机子以一缕神念为核心所做的傀儡。¤To be precise I am a puppet made by Venerable Myriad Secrets with a wisp of soul as its core.
也不知道是渡劫飞升还是灰飞烟灭。¤It is not clear if he has ascended through tribulation or perished without anything left.
我也曾四处探寻出处，在一个凡人国度的的传说中，这种每个人都可以一眼读出的文字叫做灵文。据称是仙人使用的文字。¤I have also searched everywhere for its origin. In a legend of an ordinary human kingdom, this type of writing that everyone can read easily is called spiritual pattern. It is said to be the script used by the immortals.
说罢眼前的傀儡就倒在了地上。¤After speaking, the puppet in front of you fell to the ground.
我后续也在不断追查，但是被没有什么头绪，那些灵纹也没有在别处见过。¤I have been investigating continuously since then, but I haven't found any clues. Moreover, those spiritual patterns haven't been observed anywhere else.
呵呵，说来容易，这么做避免了肉身的限制，但是却难以阻止灵魂的消散，境界越低灵魂消散的越快。¤Ha ha, it's easier said than done. While doing so would transcend the limitations of a physical body, preventing the dissipation of the soul can be challenging. The lower one's cultivation level, the quicker their soul will dissipate.
仙？凡界的规则是不会让超过化神境界的修士停留此界的，八成是凡人把某个隐世的门派唤作仙人吧。¤Immortals? The rules of the Mortal Realm do not allow cultivators who are above Deity Transformation Stage to stay in this realm. Most likely it's just ordinary people calling a certain hidden sect as immortal beings.
道友似乎有很多疑问，不过是我坚持不了多久了，道友有话快问吧。¤Fellow Daoist seems to have a lot of questions, but it's me who can't hold out much longer, so if you have something to say, ask away.
这地方也没剩什么好东西，小友能用得上就都拿走吧。¤There's not much good stuff left here, so take whatever you can use, young friend.
小友是想说这地方不似自然形成的吧？¤Are you trying to say that this place doesn't seem to have formed naturally?
他就留下了我，若是有所不测至少留下点痕迹。¤He left me behind, so that if anything happened to him, at least there would be some trace left.
我也这么认为，凡人的传说没什么可信的。不过这也是唯一线索了。¤I think so too. There isn't much credibility to legends from the mortals, but it's the only lead we have.
（这也是凡人能做到的？）¤(Is this even possible for mortals?)
眼前的牌坊毫发无损，上书“幻阴境”。¤The tablet in front of us is unscathed, with the inscription 'Illusory Yin Realm'.
极阴之地？又是一处天地异象，这等洞天福地居然能连续见到两个，还都被千机子收为己用，这位前辈倒还真是福缘不浅呢。¤Extreme Yin Land? Yet another extraordinary phenomenon. To think that such a blessed place can be seen twice in a row, and both were taken by Venerable Myriad Secrets for his own use. This Senior really has good fortune.
算上之前我们在空中发现的高阶灵纹，恐怕没有这么简单。¤Considering the advanced spiritual pattern we discovered in the air earlier, I'm afraid it's not that simple.
这傀儡威能堪比化神修士，不过没了他这片空间也开始崩溃了。¤This puppet's power is comparable to that of a Deity Transformation cultivator, but without it, this space has begun to collapse.
你用尽全身灵气准备抵挡这一击。¤You use all your spiritual energy to defend against this blow.
破界天尊浮于半空之中，只见其六只手各捏一个法印，整个空间的阴阳之力都开始向他汇聚。在灵力的影响下，空间开始撕裂扭曲。¤Lord Boundary Breaker floated in mid-air, with six hands each forming a seal. The Yin-Yang energy of the entire space began to converge towards him. Under the influence of spiritual power, the space began to tear and distort.
随着傀儡被击败，这方空间也不再稳定，突然地上的灵纹启动，空中随之出现传送门，看到的环境正是你之前进入的地方。¤As the puppet was defeated, this space is no longer stable. Suddenly, the spiritual pattern on the ground activates and a portal appears in the air, and the surroundings seen through the portal is exactly where you previously entered.
“轰”{vpunch=10,0.5}¤"Boom" {vpunch=10,0.5}
走。¤Go.
这方空间也不再稳定，突然地上的灵纹启动，空中随之出现传送门，看到的环境正是你之前进入的地方。¤This space is no longer stable. Suddenly, the spiritual pattern on the ground activates and a portal appears in the air, and the surroundings seen through the portal is exactly where you previously entered.
随着灵气的聚集，破界天尊的能量核心承受不住压力轰然爆炸，各种零件四散飞开。¤As the spiritual energy gathered, the energy core of Lord Boundary Breaker could not withstand the pressure and exploded, sending various parts flying in all directions.
看来正如这千机子所说，阴阳两界确实是后天创造的。¤It appears that Venerable Myriad Secrets was correct in stating that the Yin and Yang realms were artificially created.
空中有阴阳二气构成的黑白两色灵纹在空中游走。¤There are black and white spiritual patterns composed of the Yin and Yang energy wandering in the air.
来都来了，我们领教一下这仙人的手笔吧。¤Since we are already here, let's find out what this immortal has to offer.
两界被抽取的阴阳二气都储存在此地，维持着一个微妙的平衡。¤The Yin and Yang energies extracted from both realms are stored here, maintaining a delicate balance.
切记小心。¤Remember to be careful.
看这里的布置，他也没有抵达过此地。¤Judging from the layout here, he has never been to this place either.
这片空间本是处于极为不稳定的状态，但是似乎被人为手段修复稳定下来。¤This space was originally in an extremely unstable state, but it seems to have been stabilized by artificial means.
嗯，但你看空中灵纹的运转方式不同于这些机关禁制，甚至还更加高明。¤Well, but you see the way the spiritual pattern mid-air operate is different from these mechanical seals, it is even more sophisticated.
空中不时泛起一道道灵纹，一道道空间裂隙在这些灵纹的作用下不断愈合。¤From time to time, a spiritual pattern appears in the air, and the spatial rifts continue to heal under the effect of these spiritual patterns.
那我们继续看看还有没有别的收获。¤Let's move on to see if there is anything else to be gained.
你是想说这片空间并非天然形成的？¤Are you trying to say that this space is not naturally formed?
呼~这傀儡引动空间之力居然施展化神领域。魏老，你听说过这种技艺么。¤Phew~ This puppet actually utilized the power of space to cast the Deity Transformation Domain. Elder Wei, have you ever heard of this technique?
空间都是以那“破界天尊”调动阴阳之力开辟，一般能将天地异象化作己用已是鬼斧神工，而这里居然是人为开辟的，这一族当真是底蕴深厚。¤The space is created by "Lord Boundary Breaker" with the power of Yin and Yang. It is already an incredible feat to be able to manipulate the extraordinary phenomenon of the world, but it's even more impressive that this place was artificially created. This clan truly has a profound heritage.
嗯，我们先离开这里吧。¤Well, let's get out of here first.
这世间能人辈出，有些许隐世大族也没什么奇怪的，好在这一次虽有波折但也算收获颇丰。¤There are many talented people in this world, and it's not surprising that there are some hidden Families. Fortunately, although there were some setbacks this time, the gains were quite substantial.
而且，那傀儡明显因为时间的流逝导致威能不胜往昔，也不知全盛时期有多强。¤Moreover, the puppet's power has obviously weakened over time due to the passage of time, who knows how strong it was at its peak.
此地的石碑早已坍塌，同时这里的空间也并不稳定。¤The stone tablet here has long collapsed, and the space here is also unstable.
明白了。¤Understood.
空中泛起一圈波纹，一阵阵炙热的灵气从中散发。¤A circle of ripple appears in the air, and waves of scorching spiritual energy starts to emanate from it.
你御起护体灵气，径直冲入。¤You activate your protective Qi and charge straight in.
进入之后小心为好。¤After entering, it's better for you to be careful.
以神识深入其中，你能感知到对面仍在运转的聚灵阵和机关机构。¤By delving deeper with your Soul Sense, you can perceive the still-operating Qi Gathering Array and mechanical devices on the opposite side.
